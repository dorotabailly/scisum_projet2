Archaeology: Egypt,"The Expedition to Egypt offered a point of anchorage in the construction of Egyptian archaeology which developed under a strong French influence: the decipherment of hieroglyphs by Champollion, the direction of Le Service des Antiquités de l’Égypte between 1858 and 1952, and the creation of a scientific school based in Cairo in 1880, the future Institut français d’archéologie orientale.",['shs']

Effect of Bio Field Treatment on the Physical and Thermal Characteristics of Vanadium Pentoxide Powders,"Vanadium pentoxide powders are very useful in producing ferrous as well as aluminiumalloys, inremoving carbon and sulphur and as catalysts in synthesizing ammonia and sulphuric acid. It is also used as corrosion inhibitor petroleum and chemical processing. In the present investigation V2O5 powders are exposed to biofield. Both the exposed and unexposed powders are later characterized by various techniques. The average particle size is found to decrease with increase in number of days after treatment upto a maximum of 15.9% in 110 days indicating severe fracture at agglomerate/crystallite boundaries. The BET surface area showed a surprising decrease (it should increase as particle size is decreased) of 7.22% in 109 days indicating the surface densification/removal of sharp surface corners/formation of large particles. SEM photographs indeed showed that samples exposed to biofield after 20 days showed increase in size as well as rounded corners. Thermal analysis indicated an increase in melting temperature by 9.9% in samples treated after 57 days along with a much reduced change in weight. X-ray diffraction of the powder samples indicated both increase and decrease in crystallite size, unit cell volume and molecular weight of samples exposed to biofield after 28, 104, 124 and 139 days. These results indicate that the catalytic nature of vanadium pentoxide can be controlled by exposing to bio field and using after a specific number of days after exposure.",['phys']
Alignment of Memory Transfers of a Time-Predictable Stack Cache,"Modern computer architectures use features which often com-plicate the WCET analysis of real-time software. Alterna-tive time-predictable designs, and in particular caches, thus are gaining more and more interest. A recently proposed stack cache, for instance, avoids the need for the analysis of complex cache states. Instead, only the occupancy level of the cache has to be determined. The memory transfers generated by the standard stack cache are not generally aligned. These unaligned accesses risk to introduce complexity to the otherwise simple WCET analysis. In this work, we investigate three different ap-proaches to handle the alignment problem in the stack cache: (1) unaligned transfers, (2) alignment through compiler-gen-erated padding, (3) a novel hardware extension ensuring the alignment of all transfers. Simulation results show that our hardware extension offers a good compromise between average-case performance and analysis complexity.",['info']
Effect of Biofield Treatment on Phenotypic and Genotypic Characteristic of Provindencia rettgeri,"Providencia rettgeri (P. rettgeri) is a clinically significant Gram-negative bacterium of genus Providencia, and commonly associated with hospital-acquired infection like urinary tract infection (UTI), gastroenteritis, and ocular infections. Present study was designed to evaluate the effect of biofield treatment on P. rettgeri against antimicrobial susceptibility, biochemical reaction pattern, biotype number, and 16S rDNA sequence. The samples of P. rettgeri (ATCC 9250) were divided into three groups: Gr.I (control), Gr.II (treatment, revived), and Gr.III (treatment, lyophilized). The Gr.II and III were treated with Mr. Trivedi’s biofield, and then subsequently characterized for antimicrobial susceptibility, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), biochemical reactions, and biotype numbering. The 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to correlate the phylogenetic relationship of P. rettgeri with other bacterial species. The treated cells of P. rettgeri showed an alteration in susceptibility of about 50% and 53.3% tested antimicrobials of Gr.II on day 5 and 10, respectively; and 53.3% of tested antimicrobials of Gr.III on day 10. MIC results showed a significant decrease in MIC values of 53.1, 56.3, and 56.3% antimicrobials in Gr.II on day 5, Gr.II on day 10, and Gr.III on day 10, respectively, as compared to control. The significant changes in biochemical reactions and biotype numbers were also observed in all the treated groups of P. rettgeri. Based on nucleotides homology and phylogenetic analysis the P. rettgeri was found to be Proteus mirabilis (GenBank Accession Number: AY820623) and nearest homolog species was found to be Proteus vulgaris (Accession No. DQ499636). These findings suggest that biofield treatment can prevent the emergence of absolute resistance of existing antimicrobials to P. rettgeri.",['sdv']
"Antimicrobial Susceptibility Pattern, Biochemical Characteristics and Biotyping of Salmonella paratyphi A: An Impact of Biofield Treatment","Enteric fever is a major global problem. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance threatens to render current treatments ineffective. The current study was attempted to investigate the effect of biofield treatment on Salmonella paratyphi A (S. paratyphi A) in terms of antimicrobial susceptibility assay, biochemical characteristics and biotyping. S. paratyphi A strain were procured from MicroBioLogics in sealed packs bearing the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 9150). The study was conducted in revived and lyophilized state of S. paratyphi A. Both revived (Group; Gr. II) and lyophilized (Gr. III) strain of S. paratyphi A were subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Revived treated cells was assessed on day 5 and day 10, while lyophilized treated cells assessed on day 10 after biofield treatment with respect to control (Gr. I). The antimicrobial susceptibility of S. paratyphi A showed significant (60%) alteration in revived treated cells (Gr. II) on day 10 as compared to control. The MIC values of S. paratyphi A also showed significant (53.12%) alteration in Gr. II and on day 10 while, no alteration was found in Gr. on day 5 as compared to control. It was observed that overall 18.18% biochemical reactions were altered in the treated groups with respect to control. Moreover, biotype numbers were substantially changed in Gr. II, on day 5 (53001040, S. paratyphi A), on day 10 (57101050, Citrobacter freundii complex) as compared to control (53001000, S. paratyphi A). Besides, biotype number was also changed in Gr. III (53001040, S. paratyphi A) as compared to control. The overall result suggested that biofield treatment had significant impact on S. paratyphi A in Gr. II on day 10 with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility, MIC values and biotype number.",['sdv']
"Atomic, Crystalline and Powder Characteristics of Treated Zirconia and Silica Powders","Zirconium oxide and silicon dioxide powders are selected and subjected to a non-contact Biofield energy known to be transmitted by Mahendra Kumar Trivedi. Particle sizes d50 and d99 showed up to 71.5 percent decrease indicating that the energy had caused deformation and fracture as if the powders have been subjected to high energy milling. This is also supported by increase in specific surface area up to 19.48 percent. In the present investigation Zirconium oxide and silicon dioxide powders are exposed to Bio-field. Both the exposed and unexposed powders are later characterized by various techniques. The treated powders when characterized by X-ray diffraction are found to exhibit significant increase and decrease in the lattice parameters of the unit cell, crystallite size and density. The lattice parameters are then used to compute the molecular weight and total number of protons and neutrons in the molecule, which showed an increase up to 0.24 and decrease up to 0.31 percent. It is speculated that the Biofield energy transmitted by Mr. Trivedi is acting on the nucleus in the atoms through some reversible weak interaction of larger cross section causing changes in the proton to neutron ratios and thus energy to mass and mass to energy. Thus the effect is felt by all the atoms, and hence the unit cell, single crystal grain and grain boundaries. The stresses generated in turn may have caused deformation and fracture of the weak interfaces in the polycrystalline powders such as the crystallite and grain boundaries.",['phys']
The Exponential-Generalized Truncated Geometric (EGTG) Distribution: A New Lifetime Distribution,"This paper introduces a new two-parameter lifetime distribution, called the exponential-generalized truncated geometric (EGTG) distribution, by compounding the exponential with the generalized truncated geometric distributions. The new distribution involves two important known distributions, i.e., the exponential-geometric (Adamidis and Loukas, 1998) and the extended (complementary) exponential-geometric distributions (Adamidis et al., 2005; Louzada et al., 2011) in the minimum and maximum lifetime cases, respectively. General forms of the probability distribution, the survival and the failure rate functions as well as their properties are presented for some special cases. The application study is illustrated based on two real data sets.",['shs']

Catégories vides et explication en syntaxe,"Le concept de catégorie vide rappelle à bien des égards celui de sous-entendu des grammaires traditionnelles. Les études réunies dans ce volume montrent cependant qu'il ne prend tout son sens que lorqu'on le relie aux autres concepts de la grammaire générative chomskyenne.

THE RESEARCH COMPONENT IN THE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION OF HISTORY MAJORSИсследовательский компонент в профессиональной подготовке студентов-историков,"The article is devoted to the topic of ""traces of the past"" interpretation; its relevance is due to both the need to improve the training of history majors and the aggravation of the fight against falsifications of history (primarily domestic). The aim of the research is to analyze the correlation of humanitarian, social and technological components in the methodology of teaching historical disciplines. The comparative method was chosen as a key method. The work uses the method of hypotheses, content analysis of the source base, and experience in studying University teaching practice. Identifying the prerequisites for ""incorrect"" interpretation of historical events, the author compares legal, forensic and philosophical approaches. The theoretical significance of the article lies in the novelty of an interdisciplinary, integrated technosocial humanitarian outlook on historical research. According to the author, the best way to overcome bias is adherence to principles; a person must inspire and justify trust: this requirement is true for both a forensic expert and a scientist. The main thing is to avoid simplifications, geometric sketching of the past, reducing it to parallels and piles of additional constructions, politicized speculations. No less great is the temptation to fall into exegesis, and from the interpreter of texts to become the owner of stylization and meta-history. The task of the researcher is to reveal the specifics of the typical. It is extremely difficult to find the ""median nerve"" of an era, but this is the only way to ""qualify the subjective side of an act"" from a historiosophical perspective. The sensation and awareness of belonging to humanity obliges the scientist to think in integral, complex, figurative, and not abstract categories. Intersubjectivity itself (even intrasubjectivity) characterizes history as a humanitarian science, and not as narrowly social one (akin to jurisprudence or sociology, especially in their positivistic interpretations). The practical significance of the study lies in the fact that the material of the article can be used in the pedagogical process, and a comparison of fundamental and applied disciplines will help history majors to sort out professional and worldview issues, and teach them to distinguish between the eternal and the vain-trendy, the ideological and the tendentious. History, the author believes, is about the eternally alive, and not about the outdated things.Статья посвящена теме “следов прошлого”; актуальность её обусловлена как необходимостью совершенствования подготовки студентов-историков, так и обострением борьбы с фальсификациями истории (в первую очередь – отечественной). Целью исследования является анализ соотношения гуманитарного, социального и технологического компонентов в методике преподавания исторических дисциплин. Ключевым методом избран компаративный; в работе используется метод гипотез, контент-анализ источниковой базы, а также опыт изучения вузовской педагогической практики. Выявляя предпосылки “неверного” изложения былых событий, автор сопоставляет юридический, экспертно-криминалистический, естественнонаучный и философский подходы. Теоретическая значимость статьи состоит в новизне междисциплинарного, комплексного техно-социо-гуманитарного взгляда на исторические изыскания. По мнению автора, главное – избегать упрощений, геометрической схематизации прошлого, сведения его к параллелям и нагромождениям дополнительных построений, политизированных спекуляций. Не менее велик соблазн впасть в экзегезу, а из толкователя текстов сделаться собственником стилизации, мета-истории. Задача исследователя состоит в установлении конкретики типичного. Ощущение и осознание принадлежности человечеству обязывает учёного мыслить категориями целостными, комплексными, образными, а вовсе не отвлечёнными. Сама интерсубъективность (даже интра-субъективность) характеризует историю как науку гуманитарную, а не узко-социальную (сродни правоведению или социологии, особенно в их позитивистской трактовке). Практическое значение исследования заключается в том, что материал статьи может быть использован в педагогическом процессе, а сравнение фундаментальных и прикладных дисциплин поможет студентам-историкам сориентироваться в вопросах профессиональных и мировоззренческих, научит отграничивать непреходящее от суетно-трендового, идеологическое – от тенденциозного. История, полагает автор — о вечно живом, а не про отжившее.",['shs']
Aesthetics of History: the example of RussiaЭСТЕТИКА ИСТОРИИ: ПРИМЕР РОССИИ,"The article highlights the problem of studying historical time in terms of aesthetics and social ethics. The essence of history, according to the author, is not so much in retrospection or reflection, but in the gap between feeling and awareness. Guided by the apophatic method, the author analyzes the historiosophical views of domestic and foreign scholars and comes to the conclusion that the Soviet paradigm is true, where the only vector of human development is the liberation of labor in the name of creating a bright future for the sake of all people and for everyone.В статье обозначена проблема исследования исторического времени в ракурсе эстетики и социальной этики. Суть истории, по мнению автора, не столько в ретроспекции или рефлексии, сколько в разрыве между чувством и осознанием. Руководствуясь апофатическим методом, автор анализирует историософские взгляды отечественных и зарубежных мыслителей и приходит к выводу об истинности советской парадигмы, где единый вектор человеческого развития — освобождение труда во имя сотворения светлого будущего ради всех и для каждого.",['shs']
Statistical Analysis of the Mariana Trench Geomorphology Using R Programming Language,"This paper introduces an application of R programming language for geostatistical data processing with a case study of the Mariana Trench, Pacific Ocean. The formation of the Mariana Trench, the deepest among all hadal oceanic depth trenches, is caused by complex and diverse geomorphic factors affecting its development. Mariana Trench crosses four tectonic plates: Mariana, Caroline, Pacific and Philippine. The impact of the geographic location and geological fac- tors on its geomorphology has been studied by methods of statistical analysis and data visualization using R libraries. The methodology includes following steps. Firstly, vector thematic data were processed in QGIS: tectonics, bathymetry, geo- morphology and geology. Secondly, 25 cross-section profiles were drawn across the trench. The length of each profile is 1000-km. The attribute information has been derived from each profile and stored in a table containing coordinates, depths and thematic information. Finally, this table was processed by methods of the statistical analysis on R. The programming codes and graphical results are presented. The results include geospatial comparative analysis and estimated effects of the data distribution by tectonic plates: slope angle, igneous volcanic areas and depths. The innovativeness of this paper consists in a cross-disciplinary approach combining GIS, statistical analysis and R programming.","['info', 'math']"
Regression Models by Gretl and R Statistical Packages for Data Analysis in Marine Geology,"Gretl and R statistical libraries enables to perform data analysis using various algorithms, modules and functions. The case study of this research consists in geospatial analysis of the Mariana Trench, a hadal trench located in the Pacific Ocean. Technically, data modelling was performed using multi-functional combined approach of both Gretl and R libraries. The study aim is modelling and visualizing trends in the variations of the trench's properties: bathymetry (depths), geomorphology (steepness gradient), geology, volcanism (igneous rocks). The workflow included following statistical methods computed and visualized by Gretl and R libraries: 1) descriptive statistics; 2) box plots, normality analysis by quantile-quantile (QQ) plots; 3) local weighted polynomial regression model (loess), 4) linear regression by several methods: weighted least squares (WLS) regression, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, maximal likelihood linear regression and heteroskedasticity regression model; 5) confidence ellipses and marginal intervals for data distribution; 6) robust estimation by Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression fit; 7) correlation analysis and matrix. The results include following conclusions. First, the slope angle gradient has a correlation with the geological settings of the trench and distribution of volcanic igneous rocks. Second, the sediment thickness varies by the tectonic plates showing unequal distribution in space. Third, there is a correlation between the slope gradient and aspect degree. Forth, geospatial analysis of the bathymetry shows that the deepest part of the trench is located in the southwest .","['info', 'phys']"
An Empirical Study of R Applications for Data Analysis in Marine Geology,"The study focuses on the application of R programming language towards marine geological research with a case study of Mariana Trench. Due to its logical and straightforward syntax, multi-functional standard libraries, R is especially attractive to the geologists for the scientific computing. Using R libraries, the unevenness of various factors affecting Mariana Trench geomorphic structure has been studied. These include sediment thickness, slope steepness, angle aspect, depth at the basement and magmatism of the nearby areas. Methods includes using following R libraries: {ggplot2} for regression analysis, Kernel density curves, compositional charts; {ggalt} for Dumbbell charts for data comparison by tectonic plates, ranking dot plots for correlation analysis; {vcd} for mosaic plots, silhouette plots for compositional similarities among the bathymetric profiles, association plots; {car} for ANOVA. Bathymetric GIS data processing was done in QGIS and LaTeX. The innovativeness of the work consists in the multidisciplinary approach combining GIS analysis and statistical methods of R which contributes towards studies of ocean trenches, aimed at geospatial analysis of big data.","['info', 'phys']"
When war disrupts gender,"Europe has experienced three wars on a continental scale since the French Revolution, along with numerous other conflicts. Far from being immutable, the role of women and men in war has changed. Initially a national masculinity was constructed, one that was virile and warlike, and that excluded women from combat. Women were all the same mobilized by their countries to support “their” men, take part in the war effort, and give birth to and raise the combatants of future generations. Like all civilians, they became military targets, and as women they were also the target of sexual violence. Women also came close to combat, integrated military or auxiliary formations, and engaged in movements of struggle and resistance. The military-virile model was weakened by colonial wars, the increasing sophistication of weaponry, and the absence of conflicts on the soil of most European countries. Military service was eliminated by most European countries at the same time as the professionalization and feminization of the military grew.",['shs']
The replacement of a carbonate rock by fluorite: kinetics and microstructure,"Understanding the mechanism and kinetics of the replacement of carbonates by fluorite has application in Earth sciences and engineering. Samples of Carrara marble were reacted with an ammonium fluoride (NH4F) solution for different reaction times and temperatures. The microstructure of the product phase (fluorite) was analyzed using SEM. The kinetics of replacement was monitored using Rietveld analysis of X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the products. After reaction, all samples preserved their size and external morphology (a pseudomorphic replacement). The grain boundaries of the original marble were preserved although each calcite grain was replaced by multiple fine crystals of fluorite creating inter-crystal porosity. The empirical activation energy Ea (kJ/mol) of the replacement reaction was determined by both model-fitting and model-free methods. The isoconversional method yielded an empirical activation energy of 41 kJ/mol, and a statistical approach applied to the model-fitting method revealed that the replacement of Carrara marble by fluorite is better fitted to a diffusion-controlled process. These results suggest that the replacement reaction is dependent on the ion diffusion rate in the fluid phase through the newly formed porosity.","['chim', 'phys']"
Regional disparities in western european agriculture,"In order to explain differences in agricultural economic performance of 73 regions of the EC, a regression analysis is presented. The dependent variable is the gross value added per labour unit. The explanatory varibles are classified into two different sets: agricultural and non-agricultural. The former give a description of agriculture (crop mix, livestock and horsepower) whereas the latter is related to the general economic development (gross regional product, share of agriculture in active population, population density and importance of part-time farming). The results for 1975 are reported, and comparison with 1970 is also made.",['shs']
Development of a Granular Cohesive Model for Rolling Contact Fatigue Analysis: Crystal Anisotropy Modeling,"In rolling contact fatigue (RCF), failure mechanisms are known to be very sensitive to material microstructure. Yet, among the different numerical models developed to predict the RCF life, few models use a microstructure representation. A granular cohesive finite element model has been developed to simulate progressive damage of a structure subject to RCF and to investigate failure initiation mechanisms. This paper focuses on the implementation of crystal elasticity in the model. The numerical analysis of a representative volume element (RVE) validates the use of cubic elasticity to represent crystal behavior. The influence of the RVE size and the influence of boundary conditions applied on the RVE are evaluated in the finite element approximation framework. As regards the implementation of cubic elasticity in the RCF model, the generation of stress singularities at triple junctions is first highlighted. Then the average value of the intergranular shear stress is proved to be mesh size independent and therefore can be used as damage criterion. Finally, the influence of crystal elasticity on micro-cracks distribution is presented.",['spi']
A lower but more balanced protection for European agriculture,"The main cause of the EC Budget shortage arises from the growth in the exportposition of agricultural products from the EC while, at the same time, prices arekept well above the world market level. Pressure on the Budget is the main forcecalling for CAP reform. This can be viewed either as a chance or a threat.- A chance, because it is well known that policies which generate invisibletransfers are unlikely to be reviewed and scrutinized by policy-makers andsocial forces. Policies demanding funds from the treasury do not have such acomfortable life, they have to be justifiable to public opinion.- A threat, because a budgetary approach to CAP problems is unlikely to bringabout prospects for a comprehensive, consistent set of principles or ruleswhich would have a sound economic basis and lead to long-term economic efficiency.",['shs']
On the rapid manufacturing process of functional 3D printed sand molds,"3D printing sand mold technology offers an opportunity for the foundry industry to rethink old casting approaches and to revive the manufacturing approach using computer models. One of the major concerns in sand molding using 3D printing is the functional characterization of the 3D printed molds as its mechanical and mass transport properties. This research paper discusses the effects of binder content on the mechanical strength and the permeability of 3DP sand molds at different curing conditions. The local permeability of the 3DP specimen was measured as a function of the injection flow rate in order to quantify the inertial pressure effects. The mechanical strength of the 3DP sand molds was characterized using traditional three-point bending strength measurements. The results show that the mechanical strength of the printed molds is deeply dependent on the amount of binder and the curing process. The 3PB strength was found to increase when cured at 100 °C and decrease when cured at 200 °C for all binder contents. The 3PB strength attains its maximum when cured at 100 °C for 2 h for all binder content. In contrast, no significant effect of the amount of binder on the initial permeability of the samples before curing was observed within the functional range of binder mass fraction (1.02–1.98 %). Maximum permeability is attained at the same conditions as the 3PB strength. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the sample can be optimized within the investigated range of binder contents without resulting in any significant decrease in permeability.",['spi']
"Evaluation of Physical, Thermal and Spectroscopic Properties of Biofield Treated p-Hydroxyacetophenone","P-Hydroxyacetophenone (pHAP) is an aromatic ketone derivative that is mainly used in the manufacturing of various pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, etc. In the present study, the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment was analysed on various properties of pHAP viz. crystallite size, surface area, melting temperature, thermal decomposition, and spectral properties. The pHAP sample was divided into two parts; one was kept as control sample while another part was named as treated sample. The treated sample was given the biofield energy treatment and various parameters were analysed as compared to the control sample by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyser, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The XRD studies showed the decrease in crystallite size of the treated sample (61.25 nm) as compared to the control (84.18 nm); however the intensity of peaks in diffractogram was increased in treated sample. Besides, the surface area of treated sample was decreased by 41.17% as compared to the control. The TGA analysis revealed that onset temperature as well as Tmax (maximum thermal decomposition temperature) was increased in the treated sample. However, the latent heat of fusion (ΔH) was decreased from 124.56 J/g (control) to 103.24 J/g in the treated sample. The treated and control samples were also evaluated by UV-Vis and FT-IR spectroscopy and did not show any significant alteration in spectra of treated sample as compared to the respective control. Hence, the overall results suggest that there was an impact of biofield energy treatment on the physical and thermal properties of pHAP sample.",['chim']
Fourier Transform Infrared and Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopic Characterization of Biofield Treated Salicylic Acid and Sparfloxacin,"Salicylic acid is a naturally occurring derivative of benzoic acid, and widely used in organic synthesis and as a plant hormone. Sparfloxacin is fluorinated quinolone antibiotic having broad spectrum antimicrobial property. The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on spectral properties of salicylic acid and sparfloxacin using FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopic techniques. The study was carried out in two groups, one was set to control, and another was subjected to biofield treatment. FT-IR spectrum of treated salicylic acid showed the upstream shifting in wavenumber of C-H stretching from 2999 to 3004 cm-1 and 2831 to 2837 cm-1 and C=O asymmetric stretching vibration from 1670 to 1683 cm-1 and 1652 to 1662 cm-1. The peak intensity in treated salicylic acid at 1558 cm-1 (aromatic C=C stretching) and 1501 cm-1 (C-C stretching) was increased as compared to control. FT-IR spectrum of treated sparfloxacin showed a downstream shifting in wavenumber of C-H stretching from 2961 to 2955 cm-1 and 2848 to 2818 cm-1, and upstream shifting in wavenumber of C=O (pyridone) stretching from 1641 to 1648 cm-1. Besides, increased intensity of peaks in treated sparfloxacin was found at 1628 cm-1 [C=C stretching (pyridone)] and 1507 cm-1 (N-H bending) as compared to control. UV spectrum of biofield treated salicylic acid exhibited a shifting of wavelength (λmax) from 295.8 to 302.4 nm and 231.2 to 234.4 nm, with respect to control. Likewise, biofield treated sparfloxacin showed the shifting in UV wavelength (λmax) from 373.8 to 380.6 nm and 224.2 to 209.2 nm. Over all, the results suggest that alteration in wavenumber of IR peaks in treated samples might be occurred due to biofield induced alteration in force constant and dipole moment of some bonds. The changes in UV wavelength (λmax) of treated sample also support the FT-IR results. Due to alteration in force constant and bond strength, the chemical stability of structure of treated drugs might also be increased, which could be beneficial for self-life of biofield treated drugs.",['sdv']
Physical and Structural Characterization of Biofield Treated Imidazole Derivatives,"Imidazole derivatives have attracted significant interests in recent time for their usefulness in synthetic heterocyclic chemistry, analytical chemistry and pharmacology. Aim of present study was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on two imidazole derivatives (i.e., imidazole and 2-methylimidazole) by various analytical methods. The biofield treatment was done by Mr. Trivedi on both the compounds and both control and treated samples of imidazole and 2-methylimidazole were characterized with respect to physical, and structural properties using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS). X-ray diffraction study revealed that crystallite size varied in a different way for imidazole and 2-methylimidazole due to the presence of methyl group in 2-c position although their core was same. Treated sample of imidazole showed a slight increase in crystallite size (6.5%); however, treated 2-methylimidazole showed a significant increase (166.68%) in crystallite size along with decrease in peak intensity as compared to control. The latent heat of fusion (ΔH) of imidazole was increased up to 0.62% in treated sample as compared to control; whereas in treated 2-methylimidazole, the ΔH was decreased by 22% as compared to control. Maximum degradation temperature (Tmax) from TGA of imidazole was remained same but 2-methylimidazole was increased by 1.5% as compared to control. FT-IR spectra showed slight change in stretching frequencies of treated imidazole and 2-methylimidazole as compared to control. Both the imidazole and 2-methylimidazole showed similar UV absorbance maxima as compared to respective control sample. GC-MS data revealed that isotopic abundance ratio of either 13C/12C or 15N/14N or 2H/1H (PM+1/PM) of treated imidazole was significantly increased up to 232.51% as compared to control, however, isotopic abundance ratio of 13C/12C or 15N/14N or 2H/1H (PM+1/PM) of treated 2-methylimidazole showed a minor change from -1.68 upto 1.68% as compared to control. Overall, the experimental results suggest that biofield treatment has significant effect on structural and thermal properties of imidazole and 2-methylimidazole.",['sdv']
Latin American leaders on Twitter. Old uses for new media during political crisesLíderes latinoamericanos en Twitter.

"STS and Media Studies, Alternative Paths in Different Countries","This conversation presents three perspectives on the trajectoriesof interaction between Science & technology studies and Media studies inthree different national contexts: Germany, France and Italy. Each of thecontributions focuses on a specific country and adopts a distinctive stand-point to unfold howSTSand media studies have interacted or have main-tained boundaries and differences between them. The first contributionabout Germany moves from the outcomes of two workshops on these topics and highlights howSTSand Media studies seem to tap into each other ina highly selective manner, filling some of their conceptual and empirical gaps,but not engaging in an actual mutual discussion. The second text assumes as fulcrum the concepts of“mediation” and “dispositif”in order to argue that,in France, theseideashas played the role of a “boundary objects” enabling adialogue between the two different fields. Finally, the third and last input tothis conversation reconstructs some of the trajectories that led specificgroups or individuals working in communication studies in Italy to connectwithSTSframeworks, arguing that the concept of “mediation” emerges as aproductive common ground for both communication andSTSscholars.",['shs']
Does biotechnological innovation require organizational innovation?,"Genomic innovation can give rise to many uncertainties.New uncertainties induced by genomic innovation change the room to maneuver and upset actor’s behaviors, disrupting individual and collective strategies. A French case study shows that the new operational and organizational strategies have to upscale and pool some resources, and at the same time, enable competition and entrepreneurial freedom. Genomic innovation gives rise to new strategies and to organizational innovations, pointing to the need for regulatory innovation.",['sdv']
Long-Term Care Insurance : Information Frictions and Selection,"This paper conducts a stated-choice experiment where respondents are asked to rate various insurance products aimed to protect against nancial risks associated with long-term care needs. Using exogenous variation in prices from the survey design and individual cost estimates, these stated-choice probabilities are used to predict market equilibrium for long-term care insurance. Our results are twofold. First, information frictions are pervasive. Second, measuring the welfare losses associated with frictions in a framework that also allows for selection, it is found that information frictions reduce equilibrium take-up and lead to large welfare losses while selection plays little role.",['shs']

Experimental study of a tuned mass damper endowed with changeable stiffness and eddy currents dampingEtude expérimentale d’un amortisseur à masse accordée avec une raideur et un amortissement par courants de Foucault variables,"The Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) is a structural passive control device attached on a structure and made by a linear oscillator which natural frequency is tuned to that of the structure, or to the dominant eigenfrequency. In this study, an experimental TMD with adjustable stiffness and damping is proposed. In particular, the TMD damping arises from the eddy current damping effect due to the presence of a permanent magnet placed on the top side of the TMD mass, which is made of conductive material. The first step is to check if the dynamical properties of the proposed TMD are constant during the dynamic test and for different values of stiffness and damping. Therefore, the instantaneous modal parameters are evaluated by applying the continuous wavelet transform on the experimental data. Then, the TMD is set with optimal parameters and used to control vibrations of a frame scale model. The structure response with and without the TMD is evaluated from the experimental measurements in case of shock at the top floor, and a numerical analysis is conducted in case of seismic ground acceleration. MOTS-CLÉS : AMA, courants de Foucault, transformée en ondelettes continue, control passif.Un Amortisseur à Masse Accordée (AMA) est un système de contrôle passif, consistant à attacher à une structure, un oscillateur linéaire dont la fréquence naturelle est synchronisée avec celle du mode à amortir. Cet article s'intéresse à la conception et à l'étude d'un AMA expérimental avec des coefficients d'amortissement et de raideur facilement réglables. Ainsi, l'amortissement de l'AMA est dû à un aimant placé au-dessus d'une masse en matériau conducteur, générant des courants de Foucault. La première étape de cette recherche est de vérifier si les paramètres modaux de l'AMA ainsi réalisé restent constants durant l'essai. Ainsi, pour différents réglages de l'AMA, ses paramètres modaux instantanés sont évalués à l'aide d'une procédure d'identification modale fondée sur la transformée en ondelettes continue des signaux mesurés. L'AMA est ensuite placé sur une maquette d'un bâtiment de trois étages et ses paramètres sont réglés sur ceux obtenus par optimisation d'un critère fondé sur le coefficient d'amplification dynamique. La réponse du portique avec et sans AMA, suite à un choc appliqué au dernier étage, est alors évaluée expérimentalement. Enfin le cas du portique avec ou sans AMA, soumis à une excitation sismique à sa base est modélisé et analysé numériquement.",['spi']
Hybrid Structural Skin,"The simulation and construction of elastic gridshells in composite materials is nowadays a technique that one can consider mastered. The bracing of the grid in its final form remains however a time consuming step with a lot of manual work. The lack of alternatives to membrane covering is also an important limitation to the development of such technology. The proposed paper tries to tackle both issues through a novel concept of a hybrid structural skin made of an elastic gridshell braced with a concrete envelope. The idea is to use the gridshell as a formwork for the concrete and to guarantee a mechanical connection between the thin concrete skin and the main grid, so that the concrete ensures the bracing of the grid and that the thickness of the concrete is reduced to a minimum. To demonstrate the feasibility and interest of this structural concept, a 10 m2 prototype has been built. The main aspects of the design and of the realization of the prototype are presented here (including detailing and mix design).","['spi', 'shs']"

A New Agricultural Drought Index to Better Detect and Monitor Millet Crop by Remote Sensing in West Africa: Case of Niger,"In this paper, we propose to establish a remote sensing-based agricultural drought indicator named Agricultural Drought Condition Index (ADCI) that will detect agricultural drought linked mainly to millet crops in the agricultural area of Niger. It is obtained by combining four key parameters: Precipitation Condition index (PCI), Evapotranspiration Condition Index (ETCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI). PCI is used to reflect precipitation deficit (Du et al., 2013), VCI is used to reflect variations in the health status of vegetation, TCI is used to identify vegetation stress produced by high temperatures or excessive humidity and ETCI is used to reflect crop shortage. ADCI is calculated over the crop growth period (June to October) from 2003 to 2017 in the agricultural area of Niger. Then, a comparison analysis between the ADCI results and the millet crop yield was carried out. Based on these results, ADCI shows a very statistically significant correlation with the millet crop yield throughout the millet growth period (June-October) and it is strongly correlated with the VHI index but provided better drought conditions then VHI. This new index is quite powerful and capable to identify and monitor the agricultural drought related to the cultivation of millet.","['sdv', 'sde']"
Commuting patterns in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. What differences between formal and informal jobs?,"Limiting commuting trips in major cities is important from the environmental, social and economic standpoints. In order to design policies that aim to change commuting practices it is, however, necessary to have acquired a good understanding of the trips in question and their determinants. However, these trips have been subjected to very little study in the cities of developing countries. This paper is concerned with the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area (RJMA), and sets out to test the influence of “classical” socioeconomic and spatial variables on the distance and duration of the commuting trips of the region's inhabitants, especially those with the lowest incomes. The main original feature of this research is that it includes jobs in the informal sector. The results show that, all other things being equal, commuting distances and times are shorter for the informal sector, and people walk more from their homes to their place of work because jobs in the informal sector are more dispersed than jobs in the formal sectors. The notable exception is personal and household services for which employees (who are mainly women) live a long way from the city center where wealthy families (and their jobs) are concentrated.",['shs']

A multiclass vehicular dynamic traffic flow model for main roads and dedicated lanes/roads of multimodal transport network,We present in this paper a model of vehicular traffic flow for a multimodal transportation road network. We introduce the notion of class of vehicles to refer to vehicles of different transport modes. Our model describes the traffic on highways (which may contain several lanes) and network transit for pubic transportation. The model is drafted with Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates and uses a Logit model to describe the traffic assignment of our multiclass vehicular flow description on shared roads. The paper also discusses traffic streams on dedicated lanes for specific class of vehicles with event-based traffic laws. An Euler-Lagrangian-remap scheme is introduced to numerically approximate the model’s flow equations.,['math']
A Hierarchical Approach For Splitting Truck Platoons Near Network Discontinuities,"Truck platooning has attracted substantial attention due to its pronounced benefits in saving energy and promising business model. However, one prominent challenge for the successful implementation of truck platooning is the safe and efficient interaction with surrounding traffic, especially at network discontinuities where mandatory lane changes may lead to decoupling of truck platoons. This contribution put forward an efficient method for splitting a platoon of vehicles near network merges. A model-based bi-level control strategy is proposed. A supervisory tactical strategy based on a first-order car-following model with bounded acceleration is designed to maximize the flow at merge discontinuities. The decisions taken at this level include optimal vehicle order after the merge, new equilibrium gaps of automated trucks at the merging point, and anticipation horizon that truck platoon start to act to track the new equilibrium gaps. The lower-level operational layer uses a second-order longitudinal dynamics model to compute the optimal truck accelerations so that new equilibrium gaps have been created when merging vehicles start to change lane and the transient maneuvers are efficient, safe and comfortable. The tactical decisions are derived analytically and the operational accelerations are controlled via model predictive control with guaranteed stability. Simulation experiments are provided in order to test the feasibility and demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy.","['math', 'spi']"

Collective identity formation in hybrid organizations.,"The present article examines the process of collective identity formation in the context of hybrid organizing. Empirically, we investigate hybrid organizing in a collaborative structure at the interface of two heterogeneous organizations in the domain of new renewable energies. We draw on the literature on knowledge sharing across organizational boundaries, particularly the notions of transfer, translation and transformation, to examine in real time how knowledge sharing in a hybrid setting contributes (or not) to the emergence of a new collective identity at the interface of two heterogeneous organizations. Our findings point to two factors that limit knowledge sharing and hence to new collective identity formation in a hybrid space: 1) ambiguous or multiple organizational roles and 2) strong identities of the collaborating organizations. These findings contribute to illuminating the initial formation of a new collective identity in hybrid organizing, and hence how new hybrid organizational forms may emerge non-intentionally.",['shs']
Traffic Flow within a Two-dimensional Continuum Anisotropic Network,"Network flow computing based on macroscopic traffic flow models for large and dense networks involves a large number of parameters and variables, and significant computational efforts. We aim at reducing these and introduce a modelling framework at two-dimensional scale in order to model traffic flow of transportation systems of large surface networks. We present a network flow pattern corresponding to network flows modelling with a few network sensors of traffic count locations. We manage and evaluate traffics on wide and dense networks with a minimum of available measurements and data, through modelling of global behaviours based on local behaviours. We find that the traffic at this scale is governed by multidimensional hyperbolic conservations laws. Godunov-type method has been proposed to compute the network flow flux across computational domains.","['math', 'spi']"
"Reconstruction with local architecture, Panay Island, Philippines, 2014 - 2017,","Over the past 15 years, a number of housing projects undertaken in post-disaster situations have adopted a “local building cultures” approach to efficiently support the initiatives of affected populations, regardless of their location or origin. This becomes even more pertinent when working in rural areas where, often, populations benefit from the ancestral experience of living in their lands and so, possess a rich knowledge of theirenvironment and traditional housing, and of their strengths and weaknesses facing natural hazards. Both reconstruction projects presented in this booklet, undertaken in the aftermath of typhoon Yolanda, are a good illustration of this potential. Moreover, they highlight how such an approach favors the establishment (or rather the re-establishment) of resilience within local communities while also offering a vision for local development and well-being in continuity with the local culture, a principle deemed as strongly valuable within the international humanitarian community as a whole.",['shs']
J/\psi\ and \psi' production in proton(deuteron)-nucleus collisions: lessons from RHIC for the proton-lead LHC run,"We study the impact of different cold nuclear matter effects both on J/\psi\ and \psi' production, among them the modification of the gluon distribution in bound nucleons, commonly known as gluon shadowing, and the survival probability for a bound state to escape the nucleus --the nuclear absorption. Less conventional effects such as saturation and fractional energy loss are also discussed. We pay a particular attention to the recent PHENIX preliminary data on \psi' production in dAu collisions at sqrt{s}=200 GeV, which show a strong suppression for central collisions, 5 times larger than the one obtained for J/\psi\ production at the same energy. We conclude that none of the abovementioned mechanisms can explain this experimental result.",['phys']
The use of biomonitor <i>Tillandsia capillaris</i> to characterize the extent of atmospheric contamination by metals in the mining city of Oruro (Bolivia),"<p>The monitoring of air pollution by PM is high of concern because of the impact of these particles on the environment but also because of their numerous adverse effects on human health. An alternative to the use of filters to identify environmental pollutants contained in these particles such as heavy metals is the use of bioindicator species.<i> Tillandsia capillaris</i> are epiphytic plants of the family of Bromeliads and are often used in the air quality monitoring studies because all their nutrients are issued from the atmosphere.</p> <p>The main objective of this study was whether this species, adapted to the Andean climate, can serve as bioindicator species of air quality at the mining town of Oruro (Bolivia), where many pollution sources are identified. Bioaccumulation kinetics was conducted by exposing <i>Tillandsia capillaris</i> between 1 and 6 months in different areas of the city. The results clearly show a high level of pollution in the tin smelter in the East of the city. At this zone, biomonitors present a saturation even loss of metallic elements from 4 months of exposure. This leads us to conclude that in the case of heavy metal pollution, this plant is not suitable for a trace element tracking over 4 months. By cons, for urban areas less exposed to atmospheric metals, this plant reflects the metal levels in the air and can integrate this pollution over much longer periods than studies of filters.</p>",['chim']
Change detection matrix for multitemporal filtering and change analysis of SAR and PolSAR image time series,"This paper presents a method for analyzing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image time series based on change detection matrices (CDM) containing information on changed and unchanged pixels.

The proposed matrix is then exploited for adaptive temporal filtering, analysis of change dynamics and multitemporal change detection. The proposed approach is illustrated on the three following data sets: 25 ascending TerraSAR-X images and 7 descending RADARSAT 2 full polarization images over Chamonix-MontBlanc, France, where the seasonal evolution of glaciers and mountains can be observed, and a time series of 11 ascending ALOS-PALSAR dual polarization images over Merapi volcano, Indonesia during a period including the 2010 eruption.",['info']
3D experimental detection and characterization of microcracking in porous cement based materials,"The mechanical description of damage caused by cracking phenomena occurring in many civil engineering materials is still an open issue, in terms of initiation, propagation or localisation leading to macroscopic ruin. Detailed experimental characterization of cracking under mechanical loading is necessary to validate 3D models of crack nucleation and propagation in heterogeneous materials [1]. A dedicated experimental setup was used to perform in-situ compressive tests on an X-Ray Computed Tomography (XRCT) laboratory scanner available at Laboratoire Navier, on a cylindrical lightweight concrete sample (~10 mm in diameter). The material is made from quartz sand and expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads embedded in a cement matrix [2]. Its high porosity is suitable for crack initiation at relatively low compressive loads and stable propagation. Several load levels were successively applied to the specimen and CT images of the whole sample were recorded under constant load. Cracks developed progressively during the last loading steps and can be qualitatively observed directly in the CT images. In order to quantify their precise location and extension and to detect early-age cracking, a method based on Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) has been developed. Because local contrast is too low in EPS beads and sand grains, DVC routines have been run on positions in cement matrix, especially near interfaces, to obtain a sparse evaluation of the mechanical transformation. The latter can then be continuously extended throughout the whole sample, by means of an adjusted interpolation/smoothing procedure that also filters DVC measurements errors. Finally, after back-convection of the deformed image to the same frame as the reference image according to the estimated transformation, the difference between reference and deformed images is computed and defines the "" subtracted image "". It reflects the local evolutions of the material, not described by the fit of the coarse evaluation of the transformation. For a brittle material, it essentially gives access to the cracks. In fact, the path of cracks is clearly visible within the almost uniform grey level of the subtracted image. Segmentation of cracked areas is thus possible, while it would have been very hard to separate cracks from porosity in the deformed XRCT images. Moreover, very tiny cracks can also be detected and their sub-voxel opening evaluated. Using this DVC-assisted subtraction for all loading steps, the crack network and its evolution (propagation, opening) through the cement matrix and sand grains can be characterized in the whole sample. These results can especially be directly compared to numerical simulations computed on realistic microstructures. Because validation of numerical tools on such a complex microstructure is problematic, similar tests were performed on samples composed of EPS beads embedded in an almost homogeneous plaster matrix. Their simpler microstructure characterized by a limited number of EPS beads is easier to model and will serve for detailed comparisons between new numerical tools and experimental results.","['spi', 'phys']"
Improvement of recycled concrete aggregate properties by polymer treatments,"The recycling of concrete, bricks and masonry rubble as concrete aggregates is an important way to contribute to a sustainable material flow. The limited reuse of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA), even partially, instead of natural aggregates, can be explained by the influence on the properties of fresh and hardened new RCA-based concretes. Experimental studies were carried out on the improvement of RCA performance, especially water absorption and fragmentation resistance. The use of polymer based treatments was applied and then the performance achieved was characterized in order to show the relevance of such polymer treatment. Beneficial effects of appropriated polymer based treatments applied on RCA were obtained especially lower water absorption and better fragmentation resistance.",['spi']
Development of the Integrated Urban Hydrological Model URBS: Introduction and Evaluation of a Transfer Module in the Saturated Zone,"Development in sustainable stormwater management in cities needs adapted modelling tools, which can consider urban water cycle in an integrated manner, by modelling hydrological fluxes as well as hydric state of the urban soil. The latter become particularly important when stormwater is handled with innovative point of view treating the resource or/and climatic aspects of rainwater. Yet circulations of rainwater within urban areas are complex and are not described in a detailed manner. Integrated urban hydrological models keep on being updated. This paper presents our work as a contribution to the development of such a model. A saturation module has been implemented to the integrated model URBS. The new model runs continuously at a short time step over long periods. Model evaluation is based on its capacity to reproduce saturation level and runoff measurements. This study shows the importance of modelling groundwater movement that is highly influenced by buried sewer networks. This attempt on module implementation demonstrates the potentiality of constructing integrated model by coupling existent models in appropriate ways.","['sde', 'spi', 'phys']"

"Near-source effects and non-linear Site Response at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, in the 2007 Chuetsu-Oki Earthquake: evidence from surface and downhole records and 1D numerical simulations","The aim of this paper is to clarify the extent of near-source effects and non- linear soil response that took place at the Japanese nuclear site of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, during the MW 6.6 Niigata-Ken Chūetsu-Oki earthquake (July, 16th 2007). The interest of this case study stems from the relative small source-to-site distance and shallow hypocenter depth, coupled with the consistent seismic record database available from two down-hole arrays of strong motion accelerometers, installed within the nuclear site. Records were processed first to highlight those features related to near-source conditions, such as directivity and polarization, and, subsequently, to identify dependence of site response on the direction of motion and on the non-linear soil behaviour. Moreover, borehole interferometry was used to check the two available velocity profiles (estimated by in situ PS logging) used for 1D linear equivalent numerical simulations. In one case, an improved agreement with the empirical amplification functions was obtained using a smoothed profile. The main non-linear features highlighted by signal processing were globally reproduced by means of linear-equivalent analyses, that pointed out the strong influence of the input motion direction. Among the principal results of this research, it was found that the hanging-wall and directivity effects along with the non-linear site-effects dominate the ground response during the main shock, and that the site amplification features are strongly dependent on the rotation angle of the horizontal components.","['spi', 'phys']"

Effect of kinematic hardening on localized necking in substrate-supported metal layers,"Prediction of necking limits in thin substrate-supported metal layers, which are typically used as functional components in electronic devices, represents nowadays an ambitious challenge. The specific purpose of the current work is, first, to numerically investigate the effect of kinematic hardening on localized necking in a freestanding metal layer. Second, the impact of adding a substrate layer on the ductility evolution of the resulting elastomer/metal bilayer will be analyzed. The materials in the metal and substrate layers are assumed to be isotropic, incompressible and strain-rate independent. The behavior of the metal layer is described by a rigid–plastic model with mixed (isotropic and kinematic) hardening. The isotropic hardening contribution is modeled by the Hollomon law, while kinematic hardening is modeled by the Armstrong–Frederick law. The substrate layer is made of elastomer material whose mechanical behavior is assumed to be hyperelastic and modeled by a neo-Hookean constitutive law. The Marciniak–Kuczynski imperfection analysis is used to predict plastic flow localization. Through various numerical simulations, the influence of kinematic hardening on localized necking as well as the impact of the addition of an elastomer layer are specifically emphasized. Comparisons with experimental results are also carried out to assess the relevance of incorporating kinematic hardening in the constitutive modeling of freestanding metal sheets.",['spi']
Mutual influence of firing rates of corticomotoneuronal (CM) cells for learning a precision grip task,"As a part of a Brain-Machine Interface, we define a model for learning and forecasting muscular activity, given sparse cortical activity in the form of action potential signals (spike trains). Whereas very impressive results such as [1] exist where a reaching task is successively performed from the sole interpretation of cortical signals, we focus our efforts in formalizing how neural impulses can be transcribed into a flexion of the index finger. We have a collection of experiments in which a trained monkey (macaca nemestrina) performs a precision grip. Its neuronal activity is partially recorded as the monkey clasps two levers between its index finger and thumb. In these experiments, 33 corticomotoneuronal (CM) cells from the hand area of the motor cortex (area 4) were recorded with glass-insulated platinum-iridium micro-electrodes, refer to [2] for more details about retrieving and filtering the data in our particular experiments.

Visualization of the geophysical settings in the Philippine Sea margins by means of GMT and ISC data,"The presented research aimed to perform geophysical modelling (gravity and geoid) and to evaluate the spatio-temporal variation of the marine geological data (distribution and depth of earthquakes) using combination of the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) and available sources from the International Seismological Centre (ISC-EHB) that produce data on earthquakes as part of seismic survey and regional research projects. The target study area is a Philippine Sea basin (PSB) with two focused marginal areas: Philippine Trench and Mariana Trench, two hadal trenches located in the places of the tectonic plates subduction. Marine free-air gravity anomaly in the PSP shows higher values (>80 mGal) of the gravity fields structure at the volcanic areas and Philippine archipelago. Current study presented comparative geophysical analysis, and mapping free-air gravity and geoid in the Philippine Sea basin area. As a result of this study, the average level of earthquakes located in the Philippine Trench and Mariana Trench areas were compared, and those located in the Philippine archipelago are determined to be in the souther-western part (area of west Mindanao, south-west Visayas islands), while Luzon Islands shown shallower located earthquakes. The results on the Mariana Trench segment shown shallower located earthquakes compared of the other marginal regions of the Philippine Sea Basin. Current paper contributes to the studies on natural hazards through visualization and analysis of the earthquakes activities (occurrence and magnitude intensity), due to increasing interest to the problems of seismicity in the Pacific Ocean, which may have environmental effects causing harmful consequences and possible risks for coastal population of the Philippine islands through aftershocks and tsunami.","['info', 'phys']"

Paris Fluctuat...Ford Madox Ford's Urban Psychogeography,"Though he was born in London, Ford reported that he would never regard that city as his own and dismissed the idea of having come 'back to London' when he did return, as if the English metropolis knew not him. Paris was linked to the ebb and flow of Ford's affects and emotions and to his artistic ventures. The ups and downs of the writer's mindscape inscribe the persistence of the Parisian urbanscape in the essays. Working from the premises of psychogeography, from Guy Debord to Will Self, this chapter investigates Ford's Paris as an impressionist cityscape. Indeed, if the geography of Paris remains the same, the mental images change and Ford shows how impressions from childhood are superimposed on the adult's, with the Left Bank consistently standing for a whole continent. Invariants do persist across the years, such as the subjective image of the impassable cleft separating the Left Bank from the Quartier de l'Etoile, like two brain hemispheres. In the last resort, Paris is lived as a text, or palimpsest, affording a thorough artistic experience. Therefore this chapter attempts to read Ford's Paris through a kaleidoscope of his writings.",['shs']
The effect of mergers and acquisitions on shareholder wealth: the case of European banksL'effet des fusions et acquisitions sur la richesse des actionnaires: le cas des banques européennes,"In this paper we investigate the effect of announcements of mergers and acquisitions on bank shareholder wealth. Despite the major impact of the phenomenon of mergers and acquisitions on the future of the European banking industry, there are currently few studies that investigated this area. This is largely due to the fact that it is a relatively recent phenomenon since it began to grow in 1997. Based on a sample of 97 European banks over the period 1997-2008, our study showed that the European banking mergers and acquisitions create value but all of this value created by the purchaser's bid is received by the shareholders of the target. These appear to be the main beneficiaries of mergers and acquisition. However, shareholders of acquiring banks, meanwhile, are not harmed by the operations of mergers and acquisitions initiated by their leaders.Dans cet article, nous étudions l'effet des annonces de fusions et acquisitions sur la richesse des actionnaires de la banque. Malgré l'impact majeur du phénomène des fusions et acquisitions sur l'avenir de l'industrie bancaire européenne, il ya actuellement peu d'études qui se sont penchées ce domaine. Ceci est largement dû au fait qu'il est un phénomène relativement récent, car il a commencé à croître en 1997. Basé sur un échantillon de 97 banques européennes sur la période de 1997 à 2008, notre étude a montré que les fusions bancaires européennes et acquisitions créent de la valeur, mais tous cette valeur créée par l'offre de l'acheteur est reçu par les actionnaires de la cible. Ceux-ci semblent être les principaux bénéficiaires de fusions et acquisitions. Toutefois, les actionnaires de l'acquisition de banques, quant à lui, ne sont pas lésés par les opérations de fusions et acquisitions initiées par leurs dirigeants.","['math', 'shs']"
Role Framework to Support Collaborative Virtual Prototyping of System of Systems,"The concept of System of Systems (SoS) has become a key to handle the complexity of large scale systems designed in domains such as aerospace or defense. Virtual prototyping, by providing modeling and execution, increases the success of the SoS. Large scale systems involve heterogeneous modeling and execution formalism. Typical approaches based on types fail in offering the needed dynamicity to answer the virtual prototyping requirements. In order to bridge the existing gap between system models and execution tools, we suggest an approach based on roles and parser combinators. Roles provide a dynamic coupling between modeling and execution allowing independent evolution of modeling and execution. Parser combinators ease the integration of new modeling formalisms. This approach has been validated on a seafloor observatory project and lead to the implementation of a framework in Smalltalk.",['info']
A technology shift for a fireworks controller,"In the past, wands with polder were used to fireworks ignition. But the proximity of the operator with the explosive tubes (or parts) was very dangerous and needed a new system more safety. Nowadays, ignition of each tube or explosive device is made from a firing case, located near the management place, using electrical igniter [1]. These igniters provide to convert electrical power in a flame which ignites mortar tube. Igniters are connected to the firing system by electrical wires called shooting wires. To provide easier network of shooting wires, which may be complex, it is possible to add electrical relays in this network to reduce the number of connexions rising management place. Then, the manager selects a wire and demands ignition of selected mortar tube. This kind of classical design needs a lot of time to installation and uninstallation (Image 1). More difficulties can be added like: presence of water, high installation… This kind of solution is also expensive with shooting wires (copper electrical wires).",['info']
"Classes, Styles, Conflicts, the BIological Realm of LaTeX","The LaTeX world is composed of thousands of software components, most notably classes and styles. Classes and styles are born, evolve or die, interact with each other, compete or cooperate, very much as living organisms do at the cellular level. This paper attempts to draw an extended analogy between the LaTeX biotope and cellular biology. By considering LaTaX documents as living organisms and styles as viruses that infect them, we are able to exhibit a set of behavioral patterns common to both worlds. We analyze infection methods, types and cures, and we show how LaTeX or cellular organisms are able to survive in a world of perpetual war.","['info', 'sdv']"
Tunisian agriculture: Are small farms doomed to disappear?Agriculture Tunisienne: les petites exploitations sont elles condamnées a disparaître ?,"In Tunisia, small and medium-sized family farms dominate agriculture. From the early 80s, with the introduction of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), the conditions of production and reproduction of small farms have radically changed. In addition to the unfavorable trend of the prices, these farms are increasingly excluded from credit, land and support services. The ultimate consequence is a tendency in real incomes to decline, particularly sharp for small farms in the arid regions of the country. Faced with this degradation, small farms have developed mechanisms of adaptation or regulation allowing them to survive and, even in certain cases, to ensure more than a simple reproduction. But, it seems that the limits of these mechanisms of resistance have already reached or almost. All the indications suggest that the changes observed will lead the majority of these farmers to abandon their land and to undertake the path of proletarianization. However, other factors must be taken into account. The absence of any alternative of employment and stable income, in other activities, condemns small farms to remain in poverty and insecurity.En Tunisie, les petites et moyennes exploitations familiales dominent l'agriculture. Depuis le début des années 80, avec l'introduction du Programme d'Ajustement Structurel (PAS), les conditions de production et de reproduction de ces petites exploitations ont radicalement changé. En plus de l'évolution défavorable des prix, ces exploitations sont de plus en plus exclus du crédit, de la terre et des services de soutien. La conséquence ultime est une tendance à la dégradation des revenus réels , particulièrement marquée pour les petites exploitations dans les régions arides du pays. Face à cette dégradation, les petites exploitations ont développé des mécanismes d'adaptation ou de régulation leur permettant de survivre et, même dans certains cas, d' assurer plus d'une simple reproduction. Mais, il semble que les limites de ces mécanismes de résistance ont déjà atteint ou proches de l’être. Tous les indicateurs suggèrent que les changements observés conduiront la majorité de ces exploitants à abandonner leurs terres et à entreprendre le chemin du prolétarisation. Cependant, d'autres facteurs doivent être pris en compte. L'absence de toute alternative d'emploi et des revenus stables dans d'autres activités, condamne les petites exploitations à se maintenir dans la pauvreté et la précarité.","['math', 'shs']"
Context-Aware Verification of a Cruise-Control System,"Despite the high-level of automation, the practicability of model-checking large asynchronous models is hindered by the state-space explosion problem. To address this challenge the Context-aware Verification technique relies on the identification and explicit specification of the environment (context) in which the system-under-study operates. In this paper we apply this technique for the verification of a Cruise-control System (CCS). The asynchrony of this system renders traditional model-checking approaches almost impossible. Using the Context-aware Verification technique this task becomes manageable by relying on two powerful optimisation strategies enabled by the structural properties of the contexts: automatic context-splitting, a recursive state-space decomposition strategy; context-directed semi-external reachability analysis, an exhaustive analysis technique that reduces the memory pressure during verification through the use of external memory. In the case of the CCS system, this approach enabled the analysis of up to 5 times larger state-spaces than traditional approaches.",['info']
Evaluating GNSS Signals for Passive Local Sea State Monitoring,"Passive remote sensing based upon electromagnetic sources of opportunity provides the promise of a useful tool for monitoring natural environments and especially marine environments [1], [2], [3]. In this context, the Global Navigation Satellite Systems GNSS (GPS,...) appear as one of the most relevant solution since the emitted signals (in LBand) are reliable, available all over the world, deterministic and perfectly known. In this study, we propose to analyze and to assess the possibility of sensing the sea wave movements using the reflected L-Band signals (see figure 1). Thus, based upon numerical simulations of the electromagnetic scattered field (Method of Moments), we investigate the connections between a time evolving surface and the features in the timefrequency (TF) domain of the signal scattered by this surface (using Wigner-Ville transform). The idea is to take advantage of these representations to extract from Doppler and micro- Doppler signatures the oceanographic parameters of interest",['spi']

Hybrid Coordination Strategy of a Group of Cooperating Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"In the underwater environment, the needs of data acquisition have significantly increased over the last decades. As electromagnetic waves show poor propagation in sea water, acoustical sensing is generally preferred. However, the emergence of small and low cost autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) allow for rethinking the underwater use of optical sensors. Their small coverage can be significantly improved by using a fleet of coordinated underwater robots. This paper presents a strategy to coordinate a group of robots in order to systematically survey the seabed and detect small objects or singularities. The proposed hybrid coordination strategy is based on two main modes. The first mode relies on a swarm algorithm to organize the team in geometrical formation. In the second mode, the group formation is maintained using a hierarchical coordination. A finite state machine controls the high level hybrid strategy by defining the appropriate coordination mode according to the evolution of the mission. Before the sea validation, the behavior and the performance of the hybrid coordination strategy are first evaluated in simulation. The control of individual robots relies on visual servoing, implemented with the OpenCV library, and the simulation tool is based on Blender software. The dynamics of the robots has been implemented in a realistic way in Blender using the Bullet solver and the estimated hydrodynamic coefficients. This paper presents and discusses preliminary results of the hybrid coordination strategy applied on a fleet of 3 AUVs",['spi']
Investigation of Six Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids as Thermo-Kinetic Inhibitors for Methane Hydrate by Molecular Dynamics Simulation,"The thermo-kinetic inhibition mechanism of six imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) on methane clathrate hydrate formation and growth is studied in this work using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The ionic liquids investigated include 1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-3-methylimidazoliumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide ([C3(OH)2mim][f2N]), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide ([C2OHmim][f2N]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C2mim][BF4]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C4mim][BF4]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C4mim][OAc]) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate ([C2mim][EtSO4]). Simulations showed that [C2OHmim][f2N] and [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] are strongly hydrated compared to other ILs because of hydrogen bonding between OH groups of the cation and water molecules. They also exhibit high diffusion rates towards crystal surface and bond to it through strong intermolecular interactions. As a result, these two ILs are stronger thermo-kinetic inhibitors for formation and growth of methane hydrates compared to other ILs studied in this work as well as conventional inhibitors like methanol and NaCl. The simulations also revealed that cations of [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] and [C2OHmim][f2N] show that the presence of ions near the hydrate crystal causes hindrance for water and guest molecules adsorbing on the hydrate surface, which inhibits the growth of hydrate crystals. In addition, it is shown that [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] and [C2OHmim][f2N] are more likely to inhibit hydrate formation. Research Highlights:  Investigation of kinetic inhibition mechanism of six imidazolium-based ILs on methane hydrates formation and growth using MD simulations.  Investigation of thermodynamic inhibition mechanism of six imidazolium-based ILs on methane hydrates growth by MD simulations.  Drawing a comparison between methane hydrate inhibition Effectiveness of ILs.","['sdv', 'spi', 'phys']"
Profiles semantics for personalized information access,"Heterogeneity of information and users has raised the problem of defining a generic model, which would be used as a basis for various information access applications. In this article, we propose a profile generic model, which describes the general structure and semantics of any information or user profile for information access. Thanks to a graph, combining two profiles instances of the generic model, we define rules for deducing couples of profiles elements that have a compatible semantics and hence that we can match. These rules aim at improving the interoperability between different profiles and applications for information access.","['info', 'shs']"
The Theoretical Shapley-Shubik Probability of an Election Inversion in a Toy Symmetric Version of the U.S. Presidential Electoral System,"In this article, we evaluate asymptotically the probability ϕ(n) of an election inversion in a toy symmetric version of the US presidential electoral system. The novelty of this paper, in contrast to all the existing theoretical literature, is to assume that votes are drawn from an IAC (Impartial Anonymous Culture)/Shapley–Shubik probability model. Through the use of numerical methods, it is conjectured, that n−−√ϕ(n) converges to 0.1309 when n (the size of the electorate in one district) tends to infinity. It is also demonstrated that ϕ(n)=o(ln(n)3n−−−−√) and ϕ(n)=Ω(1n√).",['shs']
French Protestant Artists and the Refuge: 16th-17th Centuries,"Faced with the wars of religion of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many French Protestant artists chose exile to save their lives, preserve their freedom of religion and, more rarely, to put their art at the service of their faith. Their departure roughly followed the chronology of the Refuge of French Protestants, with two peaks nearly a century apart (1562-1598 and 1660-1695), as well as its geography, since these artists generally favoured the courts and large cities of Protestant lands such as England, Holland, Prussia, and Geneva.",['shs']

The sack dispersed the successors to Raphael along with the other actors of the first generation of Mannerists, thereby bringing about the immediate diffusion of the first Roman—as well as Florentine—manner, initially towards the main courts of Italy (1527 and 1528) and later to those of France (Fontainebleau) and ultimately Europe.",['shs']
Early Crack Detection of Reinforced Concrete Structure Using Embedded Sensors,"The damage in reinforced concrete (RC) structures can be induced either by the dynamic or static load. The inspection technologies available today have difficulty in detecting slowly progressive, locally limited damage, especially in hard-to-reach areas in the superstructure. The four-point bending test on the benchmark RC structure was used as a test of the quality and sensitivity of the embedded sensors. It allowed assessment of whether any cracking and propagation that occurs with the embedded sensors can be detected. Various methods are used for the analysis of the ultrasonic signals. By determining the feature from the ultrasonic signals, the changes in the whole structure are evaluated. The structural degradation of the RC benchmark structure was tested using various non-destructive testing methods to obtain a comprehensive decision about structural condition. It is shown that the ultrasonic sensors can detect a crack with a probability of detection of 100%, also before it is visible by the naked eye and other techniques, even if the damage is not in the direct path of the ultrasonic wave. The obtained results confirmed that early crack detection is possible using the developed methodology based on embedded and external sensors and advanced signal processing.",['spi']
Detection of structural changes in concrete using embedded ultrasonic sensors based on autoregressive model,"Embedded ultrasonic transmission measurements can be a cost effective and more user-friendly alternative in comparison to commonly used structural health monitoring systems used in civil engineering to detect operational or environmental changes in structure. They can be used to detect small structural changes in large concrete structures without necessity of placing a sensor on the spot where the changing is taking place. This paper presents the investigations on the possibility of utilising autoregressive model, where the velocity of ultrasonic wave in a medium is dependent on the operational state. The goal is to use the model for localization of operational changes in the large concrete structure by means of embedded ultrasonic transducer networks. In this study, several static load tests and dynamic test on large reinforced concrete beams have been performed using embedded ultrasonic sensors. Using the autoregressive model it is possible to localize operational changes in the concrete structure. The proposed approach of diagnostic signal processing allows for precise evaluation of structural changes in concrete.",['spi']

"Isotopic Abundance Ratio Analysis of 1,2,3-Trimethoxybenzene (TMB) After Biofield Energy Treatment (The Trivedi Effect®) Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry","1,2,3-Trimethoxybenzene (TMB) is one of the most versatile chemical used for the synthesis of several pharmaceuticals, dyes, polymers, organic compounds, etc. The stable isotope ratio analysis has increased attention day-by-days in several fields such as agricultural, food authenticity, biochemistry, medical research, etc. The current study was aimed to evaluate the effect of the biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance ratios of 13C/12C or 2H/1H or 17O/16O (PM+1/PM) and 18O/16O (PM+2/PM) in TMB using Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. TMB was divided into two parts - one part was denoted as control and another part was referred as biofield energy treated sample that was received through Mr. Trivediꞌs unique biofield energy (The Trivedi Effect®). The GC-MS of the biofield treated TMB was characterized at different time intervals considered as T1, T2, T3, and T4 to examine the impact of the biofield energy treatment on isotopic abundance ratio with respect to the time. The GC-MS spectra of the both control and biofield treated TMB exhibited the presence of molecular ion peak [M+] at m/z 168 (calculated 168.08 for C9H12O3) along with similar pattern of fragmentation. The relative peak intensities of the fragmented ions in the biofield treated TMB, particularly at T2 and T3 was altered from the control sample. The isotopic abundance ratio analysis in the biofield treated TMB exhibited that the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM in the biofield treated TMB at T2 and T3 was significantly enhanced by 128.13 and 117.99%, respectively with respect to the control sample. Consequently, the percentage change in isotopic abundance ratio of PM+2/PM was significantly increased in the biofield treated TMB at T2 and T3 by 125.93 and 116.67%, respectively as compared with the control TMB. The isotopic abundance ratios (PM+1/PM and PM+2/PM) in the biofield treated TMB at T1 and T4 was altered with respect to the control TMB. In summary, 13C, 2H, and 17O contributions from (C9H12O3)+ to m/z 169 and 18O contribution from (C9H12O3)+ to m/z 170 for the biofield treated TMB, particularly at T2 and T3 were significantly improved and biofield treated TMB might exhibit changed isotope effects as compared to the control sample. The biofield treated TMB might assist to develop new chemicals and pharmaceuticals through using its kinetic isotope effects like understanding the reaction mechanism, the enzymatic transition state and all aspects of enzyme mechanisms.",['sdv']
Characterization of Physico-Chemical and Spectroscopic Properties of Biofield Energy Treated 4-Bromoacetophenone,"4-Bromoacetophenone is an acetophenone derivative known for its usefulness in organic coupling reactions and various biological applications. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on 4-bromoacetophenone using various analytical methods. The material is divided into two groups for this study i.e. control and treated. The control group remained as untreated and the treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. Then, both the samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and UV-visible spectrometry (UV-vis). The XRD study revealed that the crystallite size of treated 4-bromoacetophenone was decreased significantly to 16.69% with decreased intensity as compared to the control. The thermal studies revealed that the slight change was observed in the melting point and latent heat of fusion (∆H) of biofield energy treated sample as compared to the control. Maximum degradation temperature (Tmax) of treated 4-bromoacetophenone was decreased by 7.26% as compared to the control (169.89°C→157.54°C). The FT-IR spectra showed that the C=O stretching frequency at 1670 cm-1 was shifted to higher frequency region (1672 in T1 and 1685 cm-1 in T2, in two treated samples for FT-IR) after biofield energy treatment. Moreover, the GC-MS data revealed that the isotopic abundance ratio of either 13C/12C or 2H/1H (PM+1)/PM was decreased up to 9.12% in T2 sample whereas increased slightly up to 3.83% in T3 sample. However, the isotopic abundance ratio of either 81Br/79Br or 18O/16O (PM+2)/PM of treated 4-bromoacetophenone was decreased from 0.10% to 1.62% (where PM-primary mass of the molecule, (PM+1) and (PM+2) are isotopic mass of the molecule). The UV spectra showed the similar electronic behavior like absorption maximum in control and treated samples. Overall, the experimental results suggest that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment has significant effect on the physical, thermal, and spectral properties of 4-bromoacetophenone.",['chim']
Characterization of Physicochemical and Thermal Properties of Chitosan And Sodium Alginate after Biofield Treatment,"Chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA) are two widely popular biopolymers which are used for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications from many years. The objective of present study was to study the effect of biofield treatment on physical, chemical and thermal properties of CS and SA. The study was performed in two groups (control and treated). The control group remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treated group. The control and treated polymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, CHNSO analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). FT-IR of treated chitosan showed increase in frequency of –CH stretching (2925→2979 cm-1) vibrations with respect to control. However, the treated SA showed increase in frequency of –OH stretching (3182→3284 cm-1) which may be correlated to increase in force constant or bond strength with respect to control. CHNSO results showed significant increase in percentage of oxygen and hydrogen of treated polymers (CS and SA) with respect to control. XRD studies revealed that crystallinity was improved in treated CS as compared to control. The percentage crystallite size was increased significantly by 69.59% in treated CS with respect to control. However, treated SA showed decrease in crystallite size by 41.04% as compared to control sample. The treated SA showed significant reduction in particle size (d50 and d99) with respect to control SA. DSC study showed changes in decomposition temperature in treated CS with respect to control. A significant change in enthalpy was observed in treated polymers (CS and CA) with respect to control. TGA results of treated CS showed decrease in Tmax with respect to control. Likewise, the treated SA also showed decrease in Tmax which could be correlated to reduction in thermal stability after biofield treatment. Overall, the results showed that biofield treatment has significantly changed the physical, chemical and thermal properties of CS and SA.",['chim']

Assessment of Antibiogram of Biofield Energy Treated Serratia marcescens,"Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) has become an important nosocomial pathogens and increased resistant isolates were reported. The current study evaluates the impact of an alternate energy medicine i.e. Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on S. marcescens for changes in sensitivity pattern of antimicrobial, biochemical characteristics, and biotype number. S. marcescens cells were procured from MicroBioLogics Inc., USA in sealed pack bearing the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 13880) number and divided into two groups, Group (Gr.) I: control and Gr. II: treated. Gr. II was further subdivided into two sub-groups, Gr. IIA and Gr. IIB. Gr. IIA was analyzed on day 10, while Gr. IIB was stored and analyzed on day 159 (Study I). After retreatment on day 159, the sample (Study II) was divided into three separate tubes as first, second and third tube, which were analyzed on day 5, 10 and 15 respectively. All experimental parameters were studied using the automated MicroScan Walk-Away® system. Antimicrobial susceptibility results showed that 42.85% of tested antimicrobials results in altered sensitivity pattern, while decreased minimum inhibitory concentration values in 40.62% tested antimicrobials as compared to the control after biofield treatment on S. marcescens. The biochemical study showed that 12 out of 33 tested biochemicals (36.36%) were reported for alteration of biochemical reactions pattern as compared to the control. Biotype study showed an alteration in biotype number in all the experimental treated groups as compared to the control. These results suggested that biofield energy treatment has a significant impact on S. marcescens. Overall, it is expected that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment as an integrative medicine could be better therapy approach in near future.",['sdv']
Molecular Analysis of Biofield Treated Eggplant and Watermelon Crops,"Eggplant and watermelon, as one of the important vegetative crops have grown worldwide. The aim of the present study was to analyze the overall growth of the two inbreed crops varieties after the biofield energy treatment. The plots were selected for the study, and divided into two parts, control and treated. The control plots were left as untreated, while the treated plots were exposed with Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. Both the crops were cultivated in different fields and were analyzed for the growth contributing parameters as compared with their respective control. To study the genetic variability in both plants after biofield energy treatment, DNA fingerprinting was performed using RAPD method. The eggplants were reported to have uniform colored, glossy, and greener leaves, which are bigger in size. The canopy of the eggplant was larger with early fruiting, while the fruits have uniform shape and the texture as compared with the control. However, the watermelon plants after the biofield treatment showed higher survival rate, with larger canopy, bright and dark green leaves compared with the untreated plants. The percentage of true polymorphism observed between control and treated samples of eggplant and watermelon seed samples were an average value of 18% and 17%, respectively.

The aim is to study the impact of biofield energy treatment on selected farms for cashew farming. The control and biofield treated farms were divided as control and treated farms, and Mr. Trivedi provided the biofield energy treatment to the treated farms. Further, the plants and fruits were analyzed for overall growth of plants, chlorophyll content, productivity, pathological study, and shelf life using UN specifications for International Trade, biophoton emission study, and DNA fingerprinting using RAPD method. No chemicals, fertilizers, were used on the treated plot, although regular practices were followed on control farms such as fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides due to the high incidence of disease and the requirement of nutritional supplements in the region. The analysis showed that biofield treated farm plants have thicker and stronger branches with more secondary and tertiary branches, flowering pattern, and canopy of plants was improved than trees of the same variety along with height of the plants, as compared with the control. The results showed that chlorophyll a and b content in biofield treated lands plants were increased by approximately 30% and 93% respectively, while total chlorophyll content by 45% as compared with the control. The pathological examination showed the presence of fungi namely Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Botryodiplodia theobromae in control, which were absent in treated plants. Biophoton study suggested that the cashew fruits were bigger in size with high density, strength, and vitality as compared with the control. The shelf life analysis reflected that the biofield treated cashews showed sweet taste, and can be stored for longer duration due to less moisture, and altered minerals content, such as high iodine, and low p-anisidine level. RAPD analysis showed a high level of polymorphism among control and treated samples, while level of true polymorphism among V4 variety of cashew was ranges from 0 to 100%, and in V7 variety, it ranged from 25 to 91% using different set of RAPD primers. Overall, study results suggest that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on land planted with cashew could be an alternative approach to improve the overall growth of plant, and fruit yield.",['sdv']
Students' Perceptions on Learning Management Systems of Arabic Learning through Blended Learning Model,"The emergence of various Learning Management System (LMS) applications support the implementation of Arabic learning with a blended learning model that combines traditional method (face to face) and online. The purpose of this study is to describe students' perceptions as users of the LMS application. The study was descriptive research. As many as 150 students involved in this study, 75 percent chose the blended learning model for learning Arabic. They called the ten most popular LMS application platforms such as Google Classroom, Edmodo, Schoology, Geschool, Our Class, Kelase, ClassDojo, TrackCC, Class123, and Eckovation. Of the 10 LMS applications, the best is Edmodo and the most famous is the Google Classroom. The potential of the LMS application as a representation of the blended learning model is because it has a variety of features. There are at least 16 features, namely: integration of LMS applications with social media, communication features with parents, attendance, payment, homework, conferences, forums, certificates, quiz (polling), document shares, grade books, announcements, testing/surveys, calendar/schedule, email, and chat facilities. The results of students' perceptions regarding these features indicate that they understand all the functions of the LMS features. About learning Arabic, they assessed that all LMS applications had the potential to be used for learning Arabic. The most significant potential is the ability of the LMS application to help learn speaking, writing, and grammar (Sharaf and Nahwu) skills.",['shs']

Decoding Visual Attentional State using EEG-based BCI,"Visual attention facilitates processing visual input by rapidly focusing on perceptually salient information and at the same time ruling out irrelevant information. We developed a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) platform to decode brainwave patterns during sustained attention and collected scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals from the whole brain in real time using a wireless headset. Concurrently, we collected behavioral data. Our experimental materials included a series of composite images which were made by combining a scene (i.e., indoor vs outdoor) image and a face (i.e., female vs male) image. Luminance values of all images were initially equated in terms of mean and standard deviation. There were four blocks, each comprising of 50 composite images. Two blocks began with priming faces and the other two blocks began with priming scenes. During the experiment, each participant was asked to press buttons on keyboard to distinguish between indoor and outdoor scene subcategories in blocks primed with scenes and discriminate between male and female face subcategories in blocks primed with faces. We developed an individualized model using machine learning techniques to decode visual attention based on EEG signals. Our model demonstrates an instantaneous visual attention towards face and scene categories. So far, six adult participants have partaken in the study. Having extracted EEG spectral and temporal features, we filtered out the most significant features using iterative step-wise feature reduction algorithm. The results show that the average decoding accuracy of our model is highly correlated with the behavioral data. The average behavioral response was about 85%. The average categorization between scene and face sets was 77%. Further, the EEG data accuracy is comparable to previous findings using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [1]. Findings of the present study may have clinical implications in diagnosing attention deficit in early stages of dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in elderly people [2] as well as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Further, the platform may have potential applications in assessing visual attention and closed-loop brainwave regulation in future. Reference: [1] Cohen, Jonathan D., et al.

A Declarative Approach to Information Extraction Using Web Service API,"The number of diverse web services that we use regularly is significantly increasing. Most of these services are managed by autonomous service providers. However it has become very difficult to get a unified view of this widespread data, which in all likelihood is substantially important to enterprises. A classical approach followed by the enterprises is to write applications using imperative languages making use of the web service API. Such an approach is not scalable and is difficult to maintain considering the ever-evolving web services landscape. This tutorial explores a semi-automated declarative approach to information extraction from the web services using a classical virtual data integration approach, namely mediation, that relies on a well-known query rewriting algorithm, namely the inverse-rules algorithm. It is targeted to audience from both industry as well as academia and requires a basic understanding of database principles and web technologies.",['info']

"Comparing Gesture, Speech and Touch Interaction Modalities for In-Vehicle Infotainment SystemsComparaison de Trois Modalités d'Interaction dans la Voiture: Gestuelle, Vocale et Tactile","This paper compares an emergent interaction modality for the In-Vehicle Infotainment System (IVIS), i.e., gesturing on the steering wheel, with two more popular modalities in modern cars: touch in the central dashboard and speech. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 20 participants for each modality to assess the interaction performance with the IVIS and the impact on the driving performance. Moreover, we compared the three modalities in terms of usability, subjective workload and emotional response. The results showed no statically significant differences between the three interaction modalities regarding the various indicators for the driving task performance, while significant differences were found in measures of IVIS interaction performance: users performed less interactions to complete the secondary tasks with the speech modality, while, in average, a lower task completion time was registered with the touch modality. The three interfaces were comparable in terms of perceived usability, mental workload and emotional response.Cet article présente une comparaison entre une nouvelle modalité d'interaction pour les systèmes d'info-divertissement dans la voiture, i.e., l'interaction gestuelle avec le volant, et deux autres modalités déjà implémentées dans les modernes voitures : l'interaction vocale et l'interaction tactile dans la console centrale.

Why 360° and VR headsets for movies? Exploratory study of Social VR via Hyve-3DPourquoi 360° et lunettes de RV pour les films ? Étude exploratoire de la RV sociale par le Hyve-3D,"The main goal of Virtual Reality (VR) in cinema is to immerse the spectator inside the scene. Recent VR headsets are trying to attain this goal using 360° videos. However, the storytelling and the cinema experience can be hindered because spectators using VR headsets have to continuously look around in order to explore the scene. Moreover, VR headsets restrict users to an individual experience, in which a big part of the non-verbal communication (i.e. facial expressions, gestures, and postures) is precluded. This potentially disrupts the shared and social experience of watching movies. This paper explores for the first time these potential issues by comparing a social VR system (Hyve-3D) with a cardboard VR headset during the vision of short movies including or not a storyline. Results suggest that the social VR system is more adapted for VR cinema experience.Le but principal de la Réalité Virtuelle (RV) dans le domaine du cinéma est d’immerger le spectateur dans la scène.

Incentive Mechanisms in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks,"In multi-hop wireless networks, data packets are relayed in several wireless hops from their source to their destination. Based on whether a fixed infrastructure is used or not, we can distinguish two types of multi-hop wireless networks: pure ad hoc and multi-hop cellular networks. Pure ad hoc networks do not rely on any fixed infrastructure; hence, the packet relaying service has to be provided solely by the end user devices. Multi-hop cellular networks rely on a set of base stations that are connected to a high speed backbone network; here, data packets have to be relayed by end user devices from the source to the backbone and from the backbone to the destination. Multi-hop cellular networks are a potential evolution of both voice-centric networks such as GSM and data-centric networks such as CDPD or IEEE 802.11... In this paper, we present our ongoing work on the design of mechanisms that stimulate collaboration of end users in both pure ad hoc and multi-hop cellular networks. We put the emphasis on stimulating packet forwarding, as this is one of the most fundamental services that end users should provide to each other.",['info']
"TORA, Verification, Proofs and Model Checking","Routing protocols for mobile adhoc networks (MANET) are one of the most essential components of such networks; the other being media access control (MAC) protocols. Unfortunately most existing routing protocols for MANETs are so complex that the investigation of their properties, weaknesses and performance cannot be done analytically (at least using conventional analytic methods); instead simulations have become the typical means of analyzing their properties and performance. This is an unfortunate state of affairs for such an important networking component. In this paper we develop a different means for analyzing the properties and performance of routing protocols for MANETs based on methods and techniques from formal specifications [3] and associated formal means for proof and validation. The aim is to develop rigorous proofs and tools for performance checking and analysis. The primary goal of this type of research is to develop a way to automatically check a specification for correctness and liveness properties. A secondary, but equally important role is the development of automatic tools for ameliorating discovered weaknesses and for designing such routing protocols so as to satisfy prespecified properties and performance.",['info']

Adaptive communication for collaborative interaction in smart environments,"Significant advances have been achieved in information and communication technologies in the last decade. Recent advances include virtualization technology both at the processing and the communication levels as well as standardization. The progress in networking encompasses Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication for Internet of Things and big data traffic as well as Network-Function-Virtualization (NFV) that constitute active research and standardisation activities in Europe by ETSI, and around the world by OneM2M. The design and deployment of interoperable solutions based on open systems and interfaces are identifiable as enablers for the digital market. The strategic application domains include e-heath and remote assistance systems, connected and automated vehicles, advanced manufacturing, energy management and smart homes, buildings and cities. Our objectives, in this context, involve the development of design models and management solutions to discover, compose and manage, by semantic-enabled automated procedures, the properties of adaptability essential for autonomic reconfiguration in smart environments. These properties are critical for highly dynamic software-intensive Systems of Systems such as software-defined communication networks and IoT platforms, services and applications and can be implemented by model-based design approaches and ontology-based reasoning. This research direction is of interest for many applications that, on the one hand, have strong reconfiguration requirements to manage mobility, ubiquity, adaptation and self-healing, which are essential for autonomy, and that, on the other hand, are subject to non-functional constraints of quality of service, scalability and reliability. We present, in this talk our achievements in this domain including model-based multi-level reconfiguration solutions, in order to manage simultaneously and consistently the adaptation in the different architectural levels. This is necessary for service continuity and end-to-end quality we implemented by coordinating the adaptation actions to satisfy the evolving of the context.",['info']
Coupling between homogenization techniques and brittle mechanics for modelling the behaviour of micro-cracked refractory linings,"During service, refractory linings are often subjected to severe thermo-mechanical loadings. Accordingly, these masonries may behave linearly or nonlinearly in a viscoelastic and/or viscoplastic manner. It is then interesting to investigate the creep behaviour and cracking of refractory linings. In the last decades, multi-level techniques have demonstrated their efficiency for predicting the global and local behaviour of masonry structures with low numerical cost. In this context and as a first step, we propose in this work to model masonry with safe bricks and a mortar following the Burgers or modified Maxwell rheological models at its safe and microcracked states. The proposed model is based on the coupling between linear homogenization technique and the Griffith theory. This allows the determination of the effective creep function of the microcracked mortar. The time-dependent macroscopic behaviour of the masonry is determined thanks to analytical periodic homogenization technique. The relevance of the proposed model is evaluated by reference to a numerical solution computed by finite elements method based on an incremental scheme. A similar methodology can be then adapted to viscoplastic masonries at safe and micro-cracked states using one of the available linearization schemes.","['spi', 'phys']"
Mathematics learners' behaviour in CLIL bilingual lessons within L2 external setting,"This classroom-based study discusses the language behaviour of 12-15-year old mathematics learners in introductory CLIL bilingual lessons within L2 external setting. Based on qualitative analyses of audio-records of three lessons in grades 7-9, the argument made is that learners tend to use L2 whenever they are able to. The extent of their L2 use, mostly involving short utterances and phrases rather than long sentences, is much dependent on their L2 proficiency, CLIL experience and the teacher's immediate performance in the classroom. CLIL seems to have a positive impact on learners' alertness and engagement in the lesson. Moreover, the more requirement of mathematical thinking, the less L2 use by both teacher and learners.",['shs']
Analysis of Bandwidth Allocation Models Reconfiguration Impacts,"Bandwidth Allocation Models (BAMs) are configured in MPLS/ DS-TE networks by setting Bandwidth Constraints (BCs) for traffic classes. Effectively, BAMs define how bandwidth (resource) is used and shared by network applications. Proposed BAMs like MAM-Maximum Allocation Model, RDM-Russian Dolls Model, G-RDM-Generalized RDM and AllocTC-Sharing aim to optimize the use of bandwidth for links with different bandwidth allocation characteristics and sharing. As such, the adoption of different BAMs and/or changes in the traffic profile may result in different traffic allocation patterns and distinct operational behaviors for the network. This article analyses the impact of BAM reconfiguration in relation to network parameters and characteristics such as link utilization, preemptions and flow blocking for different traffic scenarios. Authors argue that the creation of a mechanism for smoothing the BAMs reconfiguration process may result in benefits for network operation in terms of flow preemption and / or blocking.",['info']

Truncated Gaussian and derived methods,"The interest of a digital model to represent the geological characteristics of the field is well established. However, the way to obtain it is not straightforward because this translation is necessarily a simplification of the actual field. This paper describes a stochastic model called truncated Gaussian simulations (TGS), which distributes a collection of facies or lithotypes over an area of interest. This method is based on facies proportions, spatial distribution and relationships, which can be easily tuned to produce numerous different textures. Initially developed for ordered facies, this model has been extended to complex organizations, where facies are not sequentially ordered. This method called pluri-Gaussian simulation (PGS) considers several Gaussian random functions, which can be correlated. PGS can produce a large variety of lithotype setups, as illustrated by several examples such as oriented deposits or high frequency layering.",['phys']
Transforming Technology for Global Business Acceleration and Change Management,"The majority of global problems and organizational challenges are byproducts of poor human attitude and behavior (Stibe, Röderer, Reisinger, & Nyström, 2019). Every crucial domain in our lives continuously provides evidence of how things are getting unbalanced despite the progress in building increasingly capable technological innovations, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, and drones, just to name a few. Managers and employees often look for and find reasons outside of themselves for why there are weak performing organizations and global environmental issues. Societies, communities, businesses, organizations, and industries, basically everyone, need help in making their transformations succeed and sustain positive directions (Waddell, Creed, Cummings, & Worley, 2019). Many people want to change, but it is also well known how often their new year’s resolutions end in February. People tend to perceive changes as something difficult, impossible, and mystical, thus are willing to avoid them. Such attitude naturally leads to poor decisions and consequent behavioral outcomes for societies and corporations. While transformation research has gained more traction in multiple contexts over the last several years (Malar, Arvidsson, & Holmstrom, 2019), this particular transforming work is emerging as an inevitable response to the ever-growing imbalance in our lives across the globe. Advanced information technologies are being continuously developed to make our lives better and businesses grow. However, the fundamental question still remains: With all the evolving information technology, has there been significant success in achieving happier societies and strong organizations?","['sdv', 'info', 'sde', 'shs']"

Linear Sensor Network,"A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of sensor nodes deployed in a fixed or random manner over a wide area, for example for environmental monitoring applications. The sensor nodes communicate through radio links and are usually powered by batteries. In most cases, the information produced by the sensors is assigned to a base station called sink node. In the case of monitored infrastructure such as roads, tunnels, pipelines or rails, the sensor nodes are often deployed linearly. This type of network is called linear sensor network (LSN). In such a network, the data frames are carried from node to node until to reach a sink. One of the major challenges faced in linear sensor networks is to perform a good policy of radio communication interference management that takes into account the environment change and the activity of the nodes. This requires a control of propagation conditions, nodes equipped with an efficient data frame reception unit and a MAC protocol taking advantage of the linearity of the topology. .",['info']
Investigation of polyamide 11 embrittlement during oxidative degradation,"Embrittlement processes occurring during thermal oxidation are investigated for stabilized and unstabilized polyamide 11 samples differing by their thicknesses and initial molar masses. Tensile tests were carried out in the temperature range between room temperature and 110 °C in order to investigate the influence of mechanical testing temperature on the embrittlement coordinates. In the same time, molar mass and crystalline morphology are monitored by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and DSC/SAXS measurements respectively. The experimental results point out the existence of a critical molar mass for ductile-brittle transition M′c about 10 kg mol−1, independent of sample initial molar mass or stabilization, but depending on tensile testing temperature. However, even if oxidation chain scissions are shown to be clearly responsible for the loss of mechanical properties at failure, the structure-property relationships governing ductile-brittle transition require a mixed criterion involving molar mass and crystalline morphology, especially the interlamellar distance. For this purpose, specific molar mass – crystalline morphology relationships are investigated","['chim', 'spi']"
Visualization of transiently expressed mRNA in plants using MS2,"RNA transport and localization are evolutionarily conserved processes that allow protein translation to occur at specific subcellular sites and thereby having fundamental roles in the determination of cell fates, embryonic patterning, asymmetric cell division, and cell polarity. In addition to localizing RNA molecules to specific subcellular sites, plants have the ability to exchange RNA molecules between cells through plasmodesmata (PD). Plant RNA viruses hijack the mechanisms of intracellular and intercellular RNA transport to establish localized replication centers within infected cells and then to disseminate their infectious genomes between cells and throughout the plant organism with the help of their movement proteins (MP). In this chapter, we describe the transient expression of the tobacco mosaic virus movement protein (TMV-MP) and the application of the MS2 system for the in vivo labeling of the MP-encoding mRNA. The MS2 method is based on the binding of the bacteriophage coat protein (CP) to its origin of assembly (OAS) in the phage RNA. Thus, to label a specific mRNA in vivo, a tandem repetition of a 19-nucleotide-long stem-loop (SL) sequence derived from the MS2 OAS sequence (MSL) is transcriptionally fused to the RNA under investigation. The RNA is detected by the co-expression of fluorescent protein-tagged MS2 CP (MCP), which binds to each of the MSL elements. In providing a detailed protocol for the in vivo visualization of TMV-MP mRNA tagged with the MS2 system in Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells, we describe (1) the specific DNA constructs, (2) Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transfection for their transient expression in plants, and (3) imaging conditions required to obtain high-quality mRNA imaging data.",['sdv']
Does Social Pressure Hinder Entrepreneurship in Africa? The Forced Mutual Help Hypothesis,"In the absence of a public safety net, wealthy Africans have the social obligation to share their re- sources with their needy relatives in the form of cash transfers and inefficient family hiring. We develop a model of entrepreneurial choice that accounts for this social redistributive constraint. We derive pre- dictions regarding employment choices, productivity, and profitability of firms ran by entrepreneurs of African versus non-African origin. Everything else equal, local firms are over-staffed and less productive than firms owned by nonlocals, which discourages local entrepreneurship. Using data from the manu- facturing sector, we illustrate the theory by structurally estimating the proportion of missing African entrepreneurs. Our estimates, which are suggestive due to the data limitation, vary between 8% and 12.6% of the formal sector workforce. Implications for the role of social protection are discussed.",['shs']

Thyroid volume measurement in external beam radiotherapy patients using CT imaging: correlation with clinical and anthropometric characteristics,"The aim of this study is to define criteria for accurate representation of the thyroid in human models used to represent external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) patients and evaluate the relationship between the volume of this organ and clinical and anthropometric characteristics. From CT images, we segmented the thyroid gland and calculated its volume for a population of 188 EBRT patients of both sexes, with ages ranging from 1 to 89 years. To evaluate uncertainties linked to measured volumes, experimental studies on the Livermore anthropomorphic phantom were performed. For our population of EBRT patients, we observed that in children, thyroid volume increased rapidly with age, from about 3 cm(3) at 2 years to about 16 cm(3) at 20. In adults, the mean thyroid gland volume was 23.5 ± 9 cm(3) for males and 17.5 ± 8 cm(3) for females. According to anthropometric parameters, the best fit for children was obtained by modeling the log of thyroid volume as a linear function of body surface area (BSA) (p < 0.0001) and age (p = 0.04) and for adults, as a linear function of BSA (p < 0.0001) and gender (p = 0.01). This work enabled us to demonstrate that BSA was the best indicator of thyroid volume for both males and females. These results should be taken into account when modeling the volume of the thyroid in human models used to represent EBRT patients for dosimetry in retrospective studies of the relationship between the estimated dose to the thyroid and long-term follow-up data on EBRT patients.",['sdv']
Considering Transtexts as Brands,"This chapter consider Transtexts as Brand as defined by Marie-Claude Sicard (2008: 86), who discusses a set of elements in dynamic interaction turned towards a goal (to sell, to improve an image). This systemic approach called Galaxy System (with extensions on the same hierarchical level) is opposed with the classical pyramid scheme (where derivatives are hierarchically below the main product) to consider a brand universe which a narrative, a philosophy, values, an identity serve to feed. A systemic logic similar to that of the brand with Transmedia Content dispersed across different media so as to form an enriched overall narrative (Jenkins, 2003). The analysis that we propose considers under this angle the increasing proximity of the universe of the brand and that of Transmedia including fantexts to form Transtexts. In order to achieve this, in a first step, we will clarify the brand concept particularly in relation to franchising. What is at the end the difference between media brand and media franchise ? What are the characteristics of a media brand ou a transmedia brand ? How to recognize/identify it ? How to developp it ? How to manage it ? The second step will be focus on the place of fan communities in this systemic approach to show they tend to become brand communities regarding to the strategic project. In conjunction with the second section “Use and Reception by Engaged Audiences” we examines here the fan engagement from the industry perspectives. Because the public, particularly the fans, are at the heart of the participatory process of the Transmedia model, we want to assess to what extent it is possible to make a conceptual link between the two communities. We will, therefore, discuss fandom from the perspective of a community developing itself through a relationship centred around the consumption of brand which would here be a Transmedia content. Moreover we will show how the fans texts are integral part of transmedia brand identity. Instead of considering a text and a paratext to form brand identity, we have here a unified transmedia text, a transtext encompassing both industrial and fan narratives as a foundation for the identity process.

We will first revisit the dynamism of territories within their cultural angle, highlighting the complexity of their metabolisms and the importance of a design with intent. Then, we will introduce in the key notions of the complexity theory, mainly based on Edgar Morini’s philosophy, underlying new attitudes and modes of governance for research and projects’ design: the notion of system, dialogy and emergence will be described. As a conclusion, we will propose notes to pay attention to the Retrace project and the use of the systemic design methodology.","['scco', 'sde', 'shs']"
Speaker Recognition,"Speech editing is nothing more than moving about some arrays of numbers. Enhancement filters can be used to remove both natural and intentional noise, to a reasonable extent. And pitch and formant analysis can be used to give a general idea of whether two speakers are the same person or not. There are also other factors, beyond speaker variability, that presents a challenge to speaker recognition technology. Examples of these are acoustical noise and variations in recording environments (e.g. speaker uses different telephone handsets).The defect, however, are obvious in the waveform comparison. While these approaches can be used to give a rough estimate or to aid in human decisions about whether two voices are the same, computer programs like these are simply not advanced enough to be completely automated and foolproof. In other words, this is not a black box where you do not have to know anything about how the program works and just expect an accurate answer based on a certain set of inputs. Other things that we would like to explore in the subject include Delta-Cepstrum coefficients and perceptual linear predictive coefficients in order to see how much they could help with or replace pitch and formant analysis. Maybe a combination of all four would give a much higher confirmation percentage.",['info']

Teaching Ethics in Informatics: A Comparative Study,"In recent years, Schools of Informatics have begun to introduce studies in ethics, to the extent that this subject matter has become an essential part of the curriculum of students in this field. At this stage, the debate concerning the appropriateness of incorporating instruction in human and social issues into studies involving high technology careers appears to have subsided. No branch of learning, even in technological fields, can consider itself neutral since all professional activity has social consequences. This has enhanced the importance of the presence of Deontology in the subject matter offered to the future informaticist, particularly since a number of studies have demonstrated that the system of values of a student, regardless of the discipline, changes after he or she has attended classes in Ethics. However, the range of approaches to this subject in the different schools is enormous, depending basically on the teaching staff, the department that organizes the instruction and the student receiving it. The authors of this report studied the present situation in Australia and Spain, two countries that are extremely different from one another, to determine who should teach the Ethics and Deontology of Informatics, as well as what, how and where, when and to whom it should be taught. With respect to who, the available literature does not lead to any consensus. For some authors, under ideal circumstances, the instructor should hold a doctorate in philosophy with additional training in informatics. In contrast, others contend that the professor should be an informaticist with knowledge of philosophy. Each side provides arguments for and against one of the other stands, only to conclude that, in any case, it is evident that both types of professionals should be prepared to impart these classes, having had the proper training. To examine two of the most interesting questions dealt with in this study, the aspects of what and how, it was necessary to gather the opinions of both instructors and students. The tools employed for this purpose consisted of surveys, one designed for each group of subjects, based on the titles of 25 lectures and 18 teaching techniques. The first is composed mainly of a list of the major themes found in deontological codes, and is based on the analysis and actual application of the principals most frequently mentioned in the literature, including such subjects as 'Access to information and absence of discrimination', 'Copyrights: no to software plagiarism and piracy', 'Professional integrity of the informaticist (refusal of bribes)', 'Respect for intimacy and privacy on the part of the informaticist', 'Professional solidarity of the informaticist', 'Avoidance of conflict of interests on the part of the informaticist', 'The use of only licit and legal means on the part of the informaticist', etc. On the other hand, the survey concerning teaching methods focuses on 18 techniques, including: 'Analysis of case studies', 'Didactic lectures', 'Small discussion groups', 'Interviewing of professionals by students', 'Guest lectures', etc. Among other results, these surveys enabled the authors to observe and analyse the possible similarities and differences in two countries separated by vast geographical and cultural differences, as are Australia and Spain, with respect to: the concept of this course. students and instructors, taking into account the fact that most similar studies overlook the opinion of the students, a factor that the authors took into consideration given the probable existence of significant divergence between the real situation and the expectations of the student population. For example, with respect to teaching methods, in several previous surveys, the authors have observed that students prefer the study and analysis of actual cases over didactic lectures. This reflects the classical debate as to whether it is preferable to stress theoretical teaching or practical training. The existence of these earlier experiences also enabled the authors to observe the changes in attitude exhibited by the students over the course of time. The issues concerning where, when and to whom are also analysed in the context of each of these two countries, since there is no clear consensus with respect to the stage at which the course should be offered and how many credit hours should be granted, or, on the other hand, whether it should constitute a complete course, an introductory course or a seminar. Finally, and above all, the main conclusion gathered from this examination of students, instructors and school administrators confirms the original proposal, that Deontology should be a required course, mandatory for the academic training of the informaticist, rather than the exclusive patrimony of private or church-affiliated universities.",['shs']

"To the question of the environmental education: how Landsat TM, ETM+ and MSS images can be processed by GIS-techniques for geospatial research","The emphasis of this research is to demonstrate application of Landsat satellite imagery as a major resource for student and educational research. Landsat images are highly useful and strongly recommended for educational purposes as they are provided free of charge and timely regular geospatial data with 30-m resolution covering any places of the Earth. The case study describes mapping land cover types in ecosystems. It details how exactly satellite images can be used for geospatial research step by step. In the current research I used orthorectified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), MSS and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data in Geographic Tagged Image-File Format (GeoTIFF) acquired over the area of Bovanenkovo region, Yamal. The images cover study area for different time periods. The choice of Landsat data application for land cover mapping is explained by its 30-m high spatial resolution, well-known advantages of application of the Landsat scenes in research and cartography, almost 40 year old history of the image record, successful distribution and open availability. Landsat scenes were selected for the pair analysis: Landsat TM scenes for 1988-08-07 and 2011-07-14 and Landsat ETM+, 2001. The research methodology is based spatial analysis tools of the open source GIS software: Quantum GIS and ILWIS GIS. The images were georeferenced, preprocessed and imported to ILWIS from .img into ILWIS .mpr raster map format (ASCII) using GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) in main ILWIS. Minimal Distance method was sued to classify images. After converting, each image contained collection of 7 Landsat raster bands, as well as theirs metadata stored in Map List (.mpl) file, information about georeference (.grf) and coordinate system in .csy file. To visualize spectral information from the Landsat image, a color composite map has been created using combination of three raster images of the individual bands. Supervised classification of the raster imagery includes image analysis aimed at recognizing class membership for each pixel. The respective pixels are selected in Sample Set Editor, ILWIS GIS. The research method used in current research is supervised classification, which enabled to assign land cover classes by adjusting classification parameters and thresholds in DN values of spectral signature of pixels. The principle of Minimum Distance method, used for pixels classification is based on the calculating of shortest straight-line distance in Euclidian coordinate system from each pixel’s DN to the pattern pixels of land cover classes.",['info']
Why Should We Stand for Geothermal Energy ? Example of the Negative Impacts of Oil and Gas Exploration Activities Over the Marine Environment,"Geothermal energy is a clean, environmentally friendly, renewable resource that provides energy around the world. Heat flowing constantly from the interior of the Earth ensure to be an inexhaustible supply of energy. However, existing traditional sources of energy, such as oil and gas are still popular nowadays. Current paper gives an example of environmentally danger of these sources of energy. The given example of oil and gas operations within the shelf and the coast of the Barents Sea and Pechora Sea causes contamination of waters by phenol and its accumulation in the bottom sediments and life tissues of the marine habitants. At the same time, ecosystems of the south-eastern part of the Barents Sea and Pechora Sea are characterized by their high biodiversity and high level of primary production. The last one is the fundamental biological characteristics for the marine ecosystems meaning the formation of the organic substance in the water by the chlorophyll-contains organisms: phytoplankton. The primary production plays an exceptional role in the functionality of the marine ecosystem's components. Therefore, presentation gives some brief ideas on the importance of the 'green', eco-friendly sources of energy and a need for the constant development in the environmental protection of our planet.

Study object is seagrass Posidonia oceanic (P. oceanica) along the coast of Crete, Greece. The most important facts about seagrass: endemic Mediterranean seagrass, P. oceanica is a main species in marine coastal environment of Greece. P. oceanica is the largest, the most widespread, homogeneous, dense “mattes” forming meadows between 5-40 m in Mediterranean Sea. Seagrass is a component of coastal ecosystems of high importance for the marine life, playing important functions in the marine environment. Seagrasses are subjects to external factors and therefore have environmental vulnerability. The study area is located in General research area: Island of Crete, Greece. Seagrass sampling will be performed at three stations at a depth of 6-7 m: Heraklio, Agia Pelagia, Xerokampos, Crete Island, Greece. The general research objectives of the MSc research includes GIS and environmental analysis: 1) Mapping the extent of the spatial distribution of seagrass P. oceanica along the northern coast of Crete; 2) Monitoring environmental changes in seagrass meadows in the selected fieldwork sites (Agia Pelagia, Xerokampos) over the 10-year period (2000-2010). There are various multi-sources data proposed for using in spatial analysis. data of the previous measurements received during the last year fieldwork, to analyze whether P.oceanica is spectrally distinct from other sea floor types, using differences in the spectral signatures on the graphs in a WASI, the Water Color Simulator software.

Bringing Geospatial Analysis to the Social Studies: an Assessment of the City Sprawl in China,"Research area: Taipei urban landscapes, Taiwan. Located on the north of the Taiwan Island, Taipei is the country's core urban political and economic center with population reaching over 2.6 M and continuing to expand within the city. Research aim: spatio-temporal analysis of urban dynamics in study area during 15 years (1990-2005). Research objective: application of geoinformatic tools, remote sensing data and application of methodology to spatial analysis for a case study of Taipei. Data capture: The data include Landsat TM images taken from the U.S.G.S. website. The software used is ENVI GIS. Research problem: In the past decades, the process of urbanization has become more notable in the East Asia. Since past decades, Taipei city undergone serious urban changes.The development of urban landscapes in Taipei has unique feature; Taiwan's exceptional economic and industrial growth since 1980s, which is often referred as ""industrial wonder of Taiwan"". Results: In this research the analysis of changes in landscapes has been done using tools of geospatial analysis. Namely, two satellite images Landsat TM have been processed and classified using ENVI GIS software. As a result of classification, the areas occupied by different landscape types have been calculated and analyzed. Moreover, it has been detected that different parts of the city of Taipei were developing with different rate and intensity. Three (3) different residential types of the city were recognized and mapped. The results demonstrated following outcomes: 1) intensive urban development of the city of Taipei; 2) decline of green areas and natural spaces and, on the contrary, increase in anthropogenic urban spaces; 3) not parallel urban development in different districts of the city of Taipei during the 15-year period of 1990-2005. Discussion: Recently, the country quickly transformed from an agriculture-based traditional economy into a highly industrialized society. As a result, Taiwan has now a new face of high-technology oriented, economically restructured economy. This caused changes in the face of the country, modifying both its social and natural landscape patterns. Taiwan is nowadays a highly urbanized country with almost 80% of the total population of Taiwan living in urban areas. Intensive urbanization necessarily create new conditions for human-nature coexistence , since rapidly growing city and high urbanization rate affect biodiversity and ecosystems sustainability. The process of urbanization includes transformation of natural landscapes: typical natural land cover type are being transformed into human-affected artificial surfaces and the city area enlarges. Anthropogenic pressure increased rapidly due to the expansion of Taipei metropolitan area. Rapid urbanization affects complex interrelations of natural and urban ecosystems, changes their structure, size and shape, which becames a serious environmental problem. At the same time, Taiwan has unique natural landscapes with high environmental value, outstanding natural beauty, rare and extinct species. In vies of this, environmental monitoring should be considered for effective city management and nature conservation on the island.","['info', 'sde']"
"Interpretation of landscape values, typology and quality using methods of spatial metrics for ecological planning","1. Introduction: research problem This research focuses on landscapes studies with selected research area located in central Slovakia, Sitno area. The research purpose is to perform spatial analysis of the landscapes and patches within the landscapes, in order to assess, which parts of the selected study area have the highest environmental quality and value, for further environmental monitoring and management. This paper presents quantitative ecological assessment of the landscapes within the natural protected area located in Slovakia, central Europe. It contributes to the sustainable development and environmental management of the environmentally protected zones. The study area of Sitno Natura 2000 Sites is located in Slovakia, central Europe. This area belongs to the pan-European Natura 2000 network of ecologically protected areas. Natura 2000 sites are defined as pan-European reserved nature zones, which meet the requirements of high environmental criteria and belong to natural heritage of Europe. These landscapes are under strict environmental protection due to their high ecological value, unique species, rich biodiversity and other characteristics. Selected under Natura 2000 programme, habitats and endangered species of high ecological value and significance are considered as primary targets of nature conservation. Sitno Natura 2000 Sites include unique landscapes with rare and endangered species. Therefore, they have high environmental and natural value, as important part of the Slovakian and European natural heritage. At the same time, there are detected anthropogenic impacts on Sitno Natura 2000 Sites, caused by the uncontrolled tourism and other factors. 2. Methodology In this research we performed spatial analysis of Sitno landscapes using methods of landscapes metrics calculation and quantification. This include measurements of landscape elements, assessment of ecological significance, zoning of area into areas of ecological significance with different value levels. Methodologically, the landscape metrics assessment included calculations of Number of Patches (NP), Patch's density (PD), Mean patch size (MPS), Patch's size standard deviation (PSSD) and Mean shape index (MSI). This is done using information on area, size, density and shapes of the landscapes. Patches, separate parts of the landscapes, were classified using code classification, which allowed to divide landscapes into three ground categories: 1) Artificial surfaces 2) Agricultural areas 3). Forests and seminatural areas. These categories were further sub-divided into 19 sub-clusters, which were defined according to the reference scale and methodological concept of habitat classification. During the interpretation, the levels of ecological significance (SA) were assigned to every habitat. This process is based on the analysis and assessment of ecological processes in the landscape. The next step modifies the assigned degrees by the percentage proportion (P%) of habitat ́s metrics (NP, PD, MPS, PSSD and MSI) to the total number of the metric ́s value. Percentage proportion modified starting value of the ecological significance (SA). The result value of the modification factor is partial ecological significance (SB). The final ecological significance for the habitats (value SC) is presented as match average of values SB. 3. Techniques The output of this interpretation is defined by the stepwise levels of ecological values: 1)very significant 2) significant 3) moderately significant 4) almost insignificant 5) insignificant. The final results are presented as calculated numerical values which are assigned for each land cover patch within the landscape. The interpretation of these quantified data allows to define ecological value and quality of the landscapes. The ecological value, or significance, of the landscape elements is represented by the numerical values which indicate quality of the complex ecological processes within the landscape. This enables to assess it as high-level value (very precious) or low-level value (not significant). These degrees are used for zoning of the protected areas. This process quantitatively divides study area into different zones with approach to landscape conservation. The final results consist in assessed ecological values for landscapes in Sitno Natura 2000 Site. 4. Results The main result of this work is determined ecological significance of Sitno Natura 2000 Site. The ecological significance of landscape elements represents numerical values (degrees), which interpret quality of the on- going ecological process in landscape. The zoning of the protected area is done according to the degrees of the ecological significance. This process objectively divides study area into different zones with separately regime for nature conservation and landscape usage. It is characterized as a process based on the objective and ecological approach that respects human sustainable development. 4.1 Landscape elements of the study area Landscape of the study area is diversified into three base categories: 1. Artificial surfaces, where abstracted human impact; 2. Agricultural area, without any part of arable land; 3. Forests and semi-natural areas. Mentioned categories are divided into 19 sub-categories (Table 1). The number of categories is defined in accordance with used referenced scale and with the methodological concept of habitat classification. The most representative landscape element within the study area is Asperulo- Fagetum beech forests (9130), as shown in Table 1. It occupies 52,64 % of the total area (TA). The study area is represented (91,81 % of TA) mostly by Forests and semi-natural areas. The number of patches (NP) in the study area reaches 105. 4.2. Ecological significance of study area Ecological significance of landscape elements is based on the described above methodology. The Table 3 illustrates starting value (SA) of each one habitat. It is a baseline value of the ecological significance, where degrees are assigned according to Hrnčiarová et al. (1997). The study area has ecological significance at degree 3. Modification (SB) of this starting was realized according to: - Value outputs of the landscape metrics for each habitat and their percentage proportion to the metric ́s total number. - Scale degree which has stabile or moving values by increasing method. The final degree of the ecological significance is assessed by the mathematical average using partial ecological significance. The study area has final ecological significance (SC) at degree 3, but this value is needed to be diversified to the main class categories of habitats which are represented in the study area. ""Artificial surfaces"" occupy only 1,49 % of the total area and have final ecological significance at degree 5. ""Agricultural areas"" occupy 5,69 % and have value of SC at degree 2. Finally, the last class is represented by ""Forests and semi-natural areas"", which occupy 92,81 % and have degree 2 as well. The mentioned above values represent background materials for the diversification of the study area on zones with special regime of nature and landscape conservation within each zone accordingly. Conclusion The main result of this work consists in determined ecological significant areas of habitats that are under protection´s system of Natura 2000 Sites. The patches quantification of habitats is the partial result that influences process of determination of ecological significance. The interpretative process examines land cover patches by the set of landscape metrics for the area, size, density and shape (NP, PD, MPS, PSSD and MSI). The output values could express a spatial processes in the landscape, such as perforation, dissection, fragmentation, shrinkage or attrition. The final ecological significance of the study area-Sitno Natura 2000 site-is at degree 3, what means that the area is represented by moderately significant land cover patches-habitats. It indicates the same value as the one at the initial level. According to the value of the ecological significance, the study area has been diversified into three zones, where each one indicates specific level of conservation. The zones and the final degree of the ecological significance of habitats are retroactively compared to historical and cultural human development that started in this area as early as in 1st century BC. Theoretically, such a long period of intense human impacts on the local environment should completely destroy natural environment. Nevertheless, this area demonstrates rather good natural ecosystems conditions and well functioning ecological processes within the habitats. The human impact is now observed only in small range of size not more than 1,50% from total area of Sitno Natura 2000 Site. It can be explained, first, by low population density within the study area comparing to other EU areas, secondly, by accurate usage of the living area by the local population in general, and thirdly, by high resilience of the elements of landscapes towards any human impacts.","['info', 'sde']"
"Economic assessment of landslide risk for the Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs region, Alpine Foreland, Lower Austria","This research aims to assess potential risk and estimate economic damage caused by landslides. The study area is located in the Ybbs valley, Lower Austria. Methods: Methodology consists of Arc GIS based spatial analysis and estimation of the potential monetary losses caused by landslides. Spatial analysis was used for defining elements at risk located in the risk zone of 100 m near landslides, and assessment of potential consequences. Results: calculated possible losses caused by the destruction of immobility and transport: costs for buildings demolition, restoration, roads rebuilding, debris transport, excavation and removal. The region of Ybbs valley is located in mountainous Alpine Foreland, Austria. It covers a total area of 131.3 km2. The environmental conditions of the the Ybbs valley are especially prone to landslides: Geology: deposits of gravel, sand, marl, conglomerate, calcareous sandstone and clay. Most of the region is used as pasture, agricultural land, and large forests. Climatic humid to continental. Intensive rainfalls in spring and autumn months. The region is attractive for tourists due to its environmental and historical value. Data: ● Source: the data used in this research were generously provided by the Provincial Government of Lower Austria. ● Content: data include vector thematic layers covering the area, aerial imagery, topographic vector layers and maps. ● Organization: data have been organized in a ArcCatalog database and sorted according to their types. ● Compatibility: all data have been stored in the ArcGIS project in Austrian National grid Austria Bundesmeldenetz (BMN) M34. Results: 1. Defining elements at risk The elements at risk were selected in 100-meter buffer area near the landslides. The length and number of the elements at risk within the distance of 100 m near landslides totals to 20.9 km of railway lines, 13.5 km of roads and 641 buildings. 2. Calculation the economic losses The calculation of the real estate losses is computed from the calculation of five different types of costs: 1) demolition, 2) transport and disposal debris, 3) restoration of inner walls, 4) furniture restoration and 5) house construction. The average volume to demolish damaged buildings indicated the dimensions of the losses of ca. 13.65 M €. The estimated price for the debris removal is approx. 3.6 M €, in case buildings are totally affected and covered. The restoration of the inner walls is based on average prices for building restoration and approximate surface of the walls, which totally estimates 2.73 M €. Using approximate prices of the furniture costs in a typical house the costs for furniture renovation is € 190,500. Cost for house construction is computed using real estate prices and average house area in m2 which sums up to € 349,250. The losses for transport include costs to rebuild a road, a railway, and a restoration of the roads. A total of almost 140 M € would have to be invested for the renovation of the Ybbs valley in case of a landslides disaster.","['sde', 'phys']"
"Mapping land cover changes using Landsat TM: a case study of Yamal ecosystems, Arctic Russia","1. Introduction. This paper details changes in land cover types in tundra landscapes (Yamal) during since 1988. The research method is supervised classification (Minimal Distance) of the Landsat TM scenes. The new approach of the current work is application of ILWIS GIS and RS tools for Bovanenkovo region. The research area is geographically located on the Bovanenkovo region, the north-western part of Yamal Peninsula, West Siberia, Russia. The Yamal Peninsula is a flat homogeneous lowland region with low-lying plains of heights <90m. Such geographic settings create specific local environmental conditions in the region. Thus, Yamal is the worlds largest high-latitude wetland system covering in total 900,000 km2 of peatlands, complex system of wetlands, dense lake and river network. Typical for this region are seasonal flooding, active erosion processing, permafrost distribution and intensive local landslides. 2. Data. The research data are orthorectified Landsat TM scenes covering north-west of Yamal. The images have a time span of 23 years: 1988-08-07 and 2011-07-14, taken in growing season when vegetation coverage is clearly visible. 3. Methods. The research methods consist of image classification, spatial analysis and thematic mapping, technically performed in ILIWIS GIS. Research steps: 1. Data pre-processing: a) import .img into ASCII raster format (GDAL). After converting, each image contained collection of 7 Landsat raster bands b) visual color and contrast enhancement c) geographic referencing of Landsat scenes: UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator), Eastern Zone 42, Northern Zone W, WGS 1984 datum (Georeference Corner Editor, ILWIS). 2. Research area selection. The area of interest (AOI) was identified and cropped on the raw images (Fig.3). This area shows Bovanenkovo region in a large scale. The AOI area best represents typical tundra landscapes. 3. Image classification method is supervised classification (Minimal Distance), which is based on the spatial analysis of spectral signatures of object variables, i.e. vegetation types. The classes sampling was performed using Sample Set tool in ILWIS GIS. The training pixels for each land cover type were selected as representative samples and stored as classification key. They have contrasting colors, visually visible and distinguishable on the image. The defined classes include shrub tundra, willows, tall willows, short shrub tundra, sparse short shrub tundra, dry grass heath, sedge grass tundra, dry short shrub tundra, dry short shrub sedge tundra, wet peatland, peatland (sphagnum). The pixels were associated with land cover classes, using their DNs, similar to the key samples. 4. Thematic mapping: layout of main research results, represented as maps of the land cover classes. The created domain Land classes includes legend with representation colors visualizing each category. 4. Results. The research output includes following results: 1) two thematic maps of land cover types in Bovanenkovo area, Yamal (Fig.4) 2) calculation of the areas in ha of land cover types. The assessment of the areas of all land cover classes shows following results. Willows covers 2750,57 ha in 2011, which is more than in 1988, when it covered 1547,52 ha (both ’tall willows’ & ’willows’ classes). Noticeable is increase in tundra vegetation: ’short shrub tundra’, ’sparse short shrub tundra’ and ’dry short shrub tundra’ have more areas covered in 2011 comparing to 1988: almost 5442,00 ha vs 1823,00 ha.","['sdv', 'info', 'sde', 'phys']"
Study of tolerance to natural chilling stress in triploid citrus,"CONTEXT: Thanks to favorable pedoclimatic conditions, citrus production is extensively developed in Mediteranean area and mostly focused on fresh-fruit market. Nevertheless, it is well established that abiotic stresses, like low temperatures, reduce plant growth, disrupt photosynthesis and the fluidity of membrane cell. Seedlessness is one of the most consumer expectation on the fresh-fruit market. Polyploidy is an alternative developed to improve tolerance to abiotic stresses. However, little is known about the response of triploid citrus to low temperatures. The creation of triploid hybrid citrus is an alternative to develop innovative seedless commercial varieties, which present a greater abiotic stress tolerance. OBJECTIVES: Determine whether the triploidy can enhance tolerance to natural chilling temperatures of hybrid citrus",['sdv']
Risks of cryogenic landslide hazards and their impact on ecosystems in cold environments,"Research area: The research area is geographically located on the Bovanenkovo region, the northwestern part of Yamal Peninsula, West Siberia, Russia. Yamal Peninsula is a flat homogeneous lowland region with low-lying plains of heights lower than 90m. Such geographic settings create specific local environmental conditions in the region. Thus, Yamal is the worlds largest high-latitude wetland system covering in total 900,000 km² of peatlands, complex system of wetlands, dense lake and river network. Typical for this region are seasonal flooding, active erosion processing, permafrost distribution and intensive local landslides. Dominating vegetation types are typical tundra species: heath, grasses, moss, and lichens), and woody plants (shrubs and willows. the main environmental problems of this region are climate change and active landsliding, which affect on the landscapes and cause changes in vegetation coverage, i.e. land cover types. Research problem: The specific environmental problem of Yamal region is cryogenic landslides. The processes of superficial cryogenic landslides are especially active in tundra. Distribution of the permafrost, which serves as a shear surface for sliding, highly contributes to the landslide formation in this area. Cryogenic landslides developed on the fine-grained, saline marine sediments are common destructive disastrous geomorphological hazards on the Yamal Peninsula covering ca 70% of the area). Methods: The research main method consists in Landsat TM image classification, spatial analysis and thematic mapping, technically performed in ILIWIS GIS software. The choice of Landsat scenes for land cover mapping is explained by their well-known advantages of application in geosciences and cartography, almost 40 year old history of the image record, and free availability. The images have a time span of 23 years: 1988 and 2011, taken in growing season, i.e. summer to early autumn, with clearly visible vegetation coverage. The research workflow. 1. Data capture and converting import of .img file into ASCII raster format (GDAL). After converting, each image contained collection of 7 Landsat raster bands. 2. Pre-processing: Enhancement of visual color and contrast. Geographic referencing of Landsat scenes included setting of UTM projection (Universal Transverse Mercator), Eastern Zone 42, Northern Zone W, WGS 1984 datum (Georeference Corner Editor). 3.Creating Area Of Interest (AOI). The area of interest (AOI) was identified and cropped on the raw images This area shows Bovanenkovo region in a large scale which best represents typical tundra landscapes. 4.Supervised Classification. The images were classified by Minimal Distance method. This method is based on the spatial analysis of spectral signatures of object variables, i.e. vegetation types at various landscapes. The classes sampling was performed using Sample Set tool in ILWIS GIS. Training pixels for each land cover type were selected as representative samples and stored as classification key. They have contrasting colors, visually visible and distinguishable on the image. Land Cover Types: The defined classes include following landscapes types: shrub tundra, willows, tall willows, short shrub tundra, sparse short shrub tundra, dry grass heath, sedge grass tundra, dry short shrub tundra, dry short shrub sedge tundra, wet peatland, peatland (sphagnum). The pixels were associated with land cover classes using their digital numbers, similar to key samples. Results: Willows covers 2750,57 ha in 2011, which is more than in 1988, when it covered 1547,52 ha (both ’tall willows’ and ’willows’ classes). Noticeable is increase in tundra vegetation: ’short shrub tundra’, ’sparse short shrub tundra’ and ’dry short shrub tundra’ have more areas covered in 2011 comparing to 1988: almost 5442,00 ha vs 1823,00 ha. Increase of wooden vegetation class goes along with shrunk of grass and heath areas: ’dry grass heath’ occupied area of 3335.39 ha in 1988, while currently it covers 1204.94 ha. Slight decrease can be noticed in the ’peatlands’ and ’wet peatlands’ classes: 3958.40 ha against 2765.41 ha in 2011 by ’wet peatlands’, and 625.71 ha in 1988 versus 488.69 ha by ’peatland (sphagnum)’ class.","['info', 'sde']"
Detection of Vegetation Coverage in Urban Agglomeration of Brussels by NDVI Indicator Using eCognition Software and Remote Sensing Measurements,"Introduction. The study area encompasses selected regions of the Brussels municipality, Belgium. In the past years the city of Brussels is experiencing intensification of the density of building structures. Unlike in some other European cities, where the most evident problem is urbanization and expansion of the city margins to the suburbia, the urban structure Brussels is the intensification of the buildings density in the city centre and the existing dwelling districts. Thus, the city structure tends to become more intense and dense, due to the process of filling the empty spaces in the urban patterns and high level housing. Another example of urban processes in Brussels is reorganisation of the industrial areas. At the same time, monitoring vegetation areas is essential for environmental sustainability of the capital city. The lack of the green spaces may cause ecological instability and increase atmospheric pollution. For studies of the specific problems of the Brussels city the remote sensing data (raster image) was used together with NDVI function, in order to detect areas covered by city parks. Methods and Results Step I. The panchromatic image was loaded into project and processed. Step II. The image was segmented using the principle of Multiresolution Segmentation. This operation consists in the splitting of an image into segments in order to simplify complexity of the whole initial image. It is performed by the machine embedded logic based on mathematic algorithms and simplifying models. The general rule divides the area into regions according to the principle “neighbour pixels have similar parameters” (spectral reflectance value, texture, form, shape). Step III. All vegetation coverage has been detected and separated from other objects (impervious structures) using natural characteristics of the vegetation spectral reflectance. For this, first the arithmetic expression for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was created in eCognition operators using formula for spectral reflectance in visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) bands. This enables to detect pixels of vegetation: NDVI=(NIR-VIS)/(NIR+VIS). After this operation was created, it was added to the conditions of objects processing. Step IV. After this, the operation of extraction of vegetation was performed. The logical condition for vegetation detection is that we assign all objects which have values of NDVI more than 0.3 to vegetation. This is based on the properties of vegetation: dense tree canopy usually have positive values of NDVI (0.3 to 0.8). On the contrary, other objects, which do not belong to vegetation, have low NDVI values. For example, water bodies have low reflectance in both spectral bands (band 3 and band 4). Therefore, they have very low positive and sometimes slightly negative NDVI values (depending on local hydro-chemical conditions, depth, etc). Bare soils usually also have small positive NDVI values (0.1 to 0.2), since their spectral reflectance in near-infrared bands is larger than in red ones. So, using this knowledge, the NDVI formula was applied, and green areas within the city of Brussels were distinguished. The objects with NDVI values more than 0.3 were assigned to the “vegetation” class. Conclusions. The urban landscapes have complex environmental and socio-economic function and serve as habitat and agricultural surface in the surroundings. Land cover studies supported by satellite image contribute to the development of urban management system. Using object-oriented approach together with GIS techniques applied to remote sensing data enables to perform geospatial analysis with focus on urban landscapes.","['info', 'sde']"
Selective Hybrid-ARQ turbo schemes with various Combining methods in Fading Channels,"Diversity combining offers a large variety of schemes for improved bit-error-rate (BER) in packet communications. The majority of the schemes are designed to combat noise. The scheme considers metric ratio combining (MRC), Chase combining and code combining. The paper also simulates and derives the theoretical average throughput of a diversity combining schemes employing turbo coding over Rayleigh fading channels. The paper proposes an expression for the selection of hybrid ARQ schemes based on a signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR), in the presence of cochannel interference. The presented SINR expression reduces to an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when no co-channel interference exists.",['info']
Optimal Routing and SINR Target Selection for Power-Controlled CDMA Wireless Networks,"Efficient operation of wireless data networks requires not only optimization of the individual layers, but also coordination across layers.

For the first case, we provide solutions that are within a small factor of the optimum. For the second case, we present an algorithm that runs in polynomial time, and guarantees a constant factor approximation ratio.",['info']
Building zero energy districts in tropical climates. Development of design tools for morphology/comfort/energy coupled optimization.,"This is a poster presentation of my PhD thesis. The expected achievement of this thesis is a coupling platform, solving continuity (temporal and spatial) issues of current global environmental study of buildings in tropical urban areas. It will use the great range of weather-based simulation tools to assess the impact of the urban microclimate on buildings, occupants and pedestrians' comfort and ultimately optimize the urban form to passive design strategies. Current design practice for buildings located in dense urban tropical areas imply multiple, independent and multi-scale models, tools and interfaces making continuity of the overall building environmental study (from mesoscale to microscale) impossible. This modeling issue makes the efficiency of passive design strategies adapted to tropical climates uncertain. PS: The approach currently selected is to develop a coupling platform via the couple Rhino-Grasshopper. This approach and the selected tools might change or evolve in the future.","['sde', 'spi']"
ADDED VALUE PROCESS PROPOSITION FOR COLLABORATIVE DESIGN IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT PHASES USING SIMULATION MODELS IN AERONAUTICS AND AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES,"The research presented in this paper is part of a larger effort on collaborative design modelling, and is focused in the modelling of three main characteristics in collaborative design using simulation models: actors, activities and objects. To represent these three features, an added value process proposition for a collaborative design in early development phases using simulation models was suggested. The proposed process contributes to an added value solution at three different levels in the organization: the operational level, the tactic level and the strategic level, and was implemented during a project at the Research Institute of Technology SystemX having Renault and Airbus industries as partners of the project. After the project ends, dynamic interviews were done with the project team members in order to get a feedback regarding the process and to understand the collaborative interactions in a real use case. Afterwards, implementation and evaluation of the process conclude that collaboration in Modelling and simulation context is not a linear problem at all, but the proposed representation is highly adapted to improve global comprehension of the objectives and the context understanding in a first time. The results point out the actors as the key element on the collaborative design and raise a new research question.","['info', 'spi', 'shs']"
Mining Repair Actions for Automated Program Fixing,"Automated program fixing consists of generating source code in order to fix bugs in an automated manner. Our intuition is that automated program fixing can imitate human-based program fixing. Hence, we present a method to mine repair actions from software repositories. A repair action is a small semantic modification on code such as adding a method call. A repair model can be defined as a set of repair action. By applying our method on 14 repositories of Java software and 89993 versioning transactions, we present two repair models that are meant to be generalizable and reusable for automated program fixing. Hence, we then show how those repair actions can be used in an automated software repair process called MCRepair.",['info']

Modelling Landscape Changes and Detecting Land Cover Types by Means of the Remote Sensing Data and ILWIS GIS,"The emphasis of this research is to demonstrate application of Landsat satellite imagery as a major resource for environmental research using ILWIS GIS. Landsat images are highly useful and strongly recommended for educational purposes as they are provided free of charge and timely regular geospatial data with 30-m resolution covering any places of the Earth. The case study describes mapping land cover types in ecosystems. It details how exactly satellite images can be used for geospatial research step by step. In the current research I used orthorectified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), MSS and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data in Geographic Tagged Image-File Format (GeoTIFF) acquired over the area of Bovanenkovo region, Yamal. The images cover study area for different time periods. The choice of Landsat data application for land cover mapping is explained by its 30-m high spatial resolution, well-known advantages of application of the Landsat scenes in research and cartography, almost 40 year old history of the image record, successful distribution and open availability. Landsat scenes were selected for the pair analysis: Landsat TM scenes for 1988-08-07 and 2011-07-14 and Landsat ETM+, 2001. The research methodology is based spatial analysis tools of the open source GIS software: Quantum GIS and ILWIS GIS. The images were georeferenced, preprocessed and imported to ILWIS from .img into ILWIS .mpr raster map format (ASCII) using GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) in main ILWIS. Minimal Distance method was sued to classify images. After converting, each image contained collection of 7 Landsat raster bands, as well as theirs metadata stored in Map List (.mpl) file, information about georeference (.grf) and coordinate system in .csy file. To visualize spectral information from the Landsat image, a color composite map has been created using combination of three raster images of the individual bands. Supervised classification of the raster imagery includes image analysis aimed at recognizing class membership for each pixel. The respective pixels are selected in Sample Set Editor, ILWIS GIS. The research method used in current research is supervised classification, which enabled to assign land cover classes by adjusting classification parameters and thresholds in DN values of spectral signature of pixels. The principle of Minimum Distance method, used for pixels classification is based on the calculating of shortest straight-line distance in Euclidian coordinate system from each pixel’s DN to the pattern pixels of land cover classes.","['info', 'sde', 'shs']"

Data include 2 satellite images: Landsat TM for 1988 and 2011. Methods include clustering, segmentation and classification. Technical approach: Landsat TM data processing by ILWIS GIS. Methods: Supervised classification of Landsat TM images. Results demonstrated changes in selected land cover types. Study area: tundra landscapes in the wetlands of the Yamal Peninsula in the Far North of Russia. Statistical results of calculations of types of vegetation cover were obtained in a semi-automatic mode in ILWIS GIS. In 1988 ’willow shrubs’ type covered 412,292 pixels from the total part of the AOI, and ’high willow’ class is 823,430 pixels. 2011: willow increased to 651427 pixels, (’willow shrubs’), and 893092 pixels (’high willows’). Both combined classes of willows, typical for AOI with a high water content, cover total 1544519 pixels, which is 40.27 %. Area of grasses decreased compared to shrub and willow. Max area covered by class ’heather and dry grass’ is 933798 pixels","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"
"Understanding Spatiotemporal Forms, Triggers and Consequences of Urban Dynamics in Taipei: 1990-2005","Current research aims at spatio-temporal analysis of urban dynamics in study area during 15 years (1990-2005). Research objective: application of geoinformatic tools, remote sensing data and application of methodology to spatial analysis for urban studies, a case study of Taipei. Current presentation consists in 2 parts: 1) Overview of the environmental research problem, urbanization and characteristics of Taipei. Consequences of urban sprawl for the global cities, such as Taipei; 2) Detailed technical description of the GIS part: remote sensing data capture, pre-processing, algorithm processing, image classification and spatial analysis. The spatial analysis performed by means of GIS ENVI enabled to use satellite images for social and urban studies. The spatio-temporal analysis was applied to Landsat TM images taken at 1990 and 2005. Built-in functions of the mathematical algorithms (K-means) enabled to process raster Landsat TM images and to derive information from them.","['info', 'sde']"
On Model Subtyping,"Various approaches have recently been proposed to ease the manipulation of models for specific purposes (e.g., automatic model adaptation or reuse of model transformations). Such approaches raise the need for a unified theory that would ease their combination, but would also outline the scope of what can be expected in terms of engineering to put model manipulation into action. In this work, we address this problem from the model substitutability point of view, through model typing. We introduce four mechanisms to achieve model substitutability, each formally defined by a subtyping relation. We then discuss how to declare and check these subtyping relations. This work provides a formal reference specification establishing a family of model-oriented type systems. These type systems enable many facilities that are well known at the programming language level. Such facilities range from abstraction, reuse and safety to impact analyses and auto-completion.",['info']
Stress gradient effects on the nucleation and propagation of cohesive cracks,"The aim of the present work is to study the nucleation and propagation of cohesive cracks in two-dimensional elastic structures. The crack evolution is governed by Dugdale’s cohesive force model. Specifically, we investigate the stabilizing effect of the stress field non-uniformity by introducing a length l which characterizes the stress gradient in a neighborhood of the point where the crack nucleates. We distinguish two stages in the crack evolution: the first one where the entire crack is submitted to cohesive forces, followed by a second one where a non-cohesive part appears. Assuming that the material characteristic length dc associated with Dugdale’s model is small in comparison with the dimension L of the body, we develop a two-scale approach and, using the methods of complex analysis, obtain the entire crack evolution with the loading in closed form. In particular, we show that the propagation is stable during the first stage, but becomes unstable with a brutal crack length jump as soon as the non-cohesive crack part appears. We also discuss the influence of the problem parameters and study the sensitivity to imperfections.","['math', 'phys']"
Feasibility study of à PLC system for avionic safety-critical systems,"To increase the flexibility of the aircraft equipments and to reduce the possession and operating costs of the aircrafts, the main aircraft manufacturers want to change fluidic systems by electrical systems. However, this evolution induces a high increase of the number of wires. Reducing the amount of wiring also allows decreasing the construction and the maintenance costs, and the polluting emissions. The other interest is improving the reliability of aircraft equipment such as allowing monitoring of power cables (telemetry). To limit the number wires, we proposed to use power line communication (PLC) for flight control systems (FCS) on the high voltage direct current network (HVDC), between a calculator unit and a power inverter. PLC technology has proven its reliability for indoor network with the Homeplug Av standard. Nowadays, many studies deal with the possibility to use PLC for embedded systems. However, PLC for safety-critical avionic systems are not often studied. The proposed transmission technique used is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which is widely used with success in many telecommunication systems. In this paper, we present throughput measurement with Homeplug Av modems to prove the feasibility of PLC in aircraft environment. Based on channel transfer function measurements and analysis, we proposed to adapt the OFDM parameters to comply with the FCS real-time constraints.",['info']
Conflicts of Interest and Incentives to Bias: A Microeconomic Critique of Google’s Tangled Position on the Web,"Media scholars have studied and critiqued search engines – and in particular thedominant commercial actor, Google – for over a decade. Several conceptual andmethodological problems, such as a lack of technological transparency, have madea detailed analysis of concrete power relations and their effects difficult. This paperargues that a microeconomic approach can aid media scholars in examining the complexinteractions that underpin the dynamics of information visibility unfolding around theGoogle search engine. Using the concept of a ‘three-sided market’, we characterize thebusiness model built around google.com as the foundation of the company’s success.We then argue that the combination of search and advertising services, and in particularadvertisingnetworkservices, creates powerful incentives to orient the results page inself-serving ways, leading to fundamental conflicts of interest exacerbated by Google’sdominant position in both markets. Based on search engines’ mass media-like capacityto shape public discourse, we consider the identification of economic forces both asa prerequisite for a robust critique of the current situation and as a starting point forthinking about regulatory measures.",['shs']

"Unexpected developments in Maghrebian fertility, Population & Societies","In the countries of the Maghreb where fertility was traditionally very high, the rapid and almost simultaneous fertility decline in the 1980s came as a surprise. Demographers then predicted a steady fall to below two children per women, following the trend observed in many countries of Asia and Latin America. But as Zahia Ouadah-Bedidi, Jacques Vallin et Ibtihel Bouchoucha explain, fertility in North Africa has again surprised observers by remaining consistently above the two-child threshold.",['shs']
Palatine Sutures as Age Indicator: A Controlled Study in the Elderly,"Vault sutures have proven their low reliability for estimating age at death in individual forensic science cases. We broke down the palatine sutures of 134 skulls (with known sex and age at time of death) into 15 subparts and 5 stages of fusion to obtain a mean coefficient of obliteration (Cp) which was then linked to five age classes. We completed this study with multiple regression equations of total palatine suture scores. We compared our results with those obtained using the Mann method on the one hand and classically segmented and scored ectocranial suture age determination methods on the other. Palatine sutures generally do not estimate age at death any better than cranial vault sutures. Despite the partly subjective aspect of suture study, palatine suture observation contributes additional information to age-range estimation, especially in old and very old subjects where other methods lose their effectiveness.",['shs']
Age estimation from the sternal end of the fourth rib: a study of the validity of İşcan's Method in Tunisian male population.,"The aim of this study was to assess the fourth rib phase İşcan method on a Tunisian sample. One hundred and eight (108) specimens of sternal ends of fourth ribs of Tunisian male population were collected during forensic autopsies performed in the Department of Forensic Medicine and Pathology of the University Hospital Fattouma Bourguiba of Monastir. Two operators, independently, assigned each rib to İşcan's phase. The data obtained by the two operators were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 and MedCalc. The repeatability and accuracy of İşcan method was tested by kappa coefficient (κ), for each operator. Spearman correlation coefficient (R), between estimated İşcan phase and İşcan phase relative to chronological age, was good with values of 0.758 (CI: 0.664-0.828) and 0.717 (CI: 0.611-0.798) for operator 1 and operator 2, respectively. The perfect agreement, between İşcan phase related to chronological age and İşcan phase estimated by both operators, was found for phases fewer than 5. Intra-observer agreement was highest for both operators with kappa value of 0.73 for operator 1 and 0.71 for operator 2. The estimation of the observers fell within one phase from the ideal and there was minimal disparity. A good accuracy between operator 1 and operator 2 was found (κ=0.747, p=0.057). In order to improve the results, we have pooled ages in five new phases. The correlation, between new age groups and İşcan phase estimated by both operators, was moderate. We conclude that İşcan method can be applicable in Tunisian population with a good correlation for age ranges under 39years.",['shs']

Scanning electron microscopy analysis of experimental bone hacking trauma of the mandible.,"The authors report on a macroscopic and microscopic study of human mandible bone lesions achieved by a single-blade knife and a hatchet. The aim of this work was to complete the previous data (scanning electron microscopy analysis of bone lesions made by a single-blade knife and a hatchet, on human femurs) and to compare the lesions of the femur with those of the mandible. The results indicate that the mandible is a more fragile bone, but the features observed on the mandible are quite similar to those previously observed on the femur. This work spells out the main scanning electron microscopy characteristics of sharp (bone cutting) and blunt (exerting a pressure on the bone) mechanisms on human bone. Weapon characteristics serve to explain all of these features.",['shs']
Scanning electron microscopy analysis of experimental bone hacking trauma.,"The authors report on their macro- and microscopy study of bone lesions made by a sharp force instrument (a single blade knife), and a sharp-blunt instrument classified as a chopping weapon (a hatchet). The aim of this work was to attempt to identify the instrument by analyzing the general class characteristics of the cuts. Each weapon was used on human bones. The results indicate that macroscopic analysis is more problematic. The microscopic analysis assessed that characteristics examined were effective in distinguishing sharp from sharp-blunt injury to the bone. The microscope facilitates analysis unachievable with macroscopic methods, some three-dimensional characteristics not visible to the naked eye being clearly defined with its use. Emphasis has been placed on the value of SEM as an anthropologist's tool in bone lesion injuries.",['shs']
"For everything: Tim Berners-Lee, winner of the 2016 Turing award for having invented… the Web","What could be a common point among getting information about a concert, transferring money from one’s bank account, publishing a genomics database, communicating with one’s children on the other side of the planet, and accessing information about one’s car ? The fact that they can all be done through the Web. It is indeed difficult to think of a human activity that hasn’t been impacted by the Web, and as I write this article in April 2017, the current estimate is that the Web has more than 3 billion direct users throughout the world. In the same month, the British computer scientist Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee was awarded the 2016 Turing prize for having invented the World Wide Web, the first Web browser, and the protocols and algorithms that enabled the passage to the scale of the Web. Sir Tim, as he is called, is a professor at MIT and at Oxford University. This prize is just the latest of a long list of distinctions that he has received. But the Turing prize is considered the Nobel prize of computer science, and this award has been widely expected for his invention of the Web, an invention which has transformed our society since its creation in 1989. This is thus a good occasion to revisit, in this article, the history of his invention, and at the same time try to highlight many of the influences and currents that interacted to bring it about. This will also be an occasion, for us, to deconstruct certain notions and to reintegrate others, in an effort to tie together the numerous influences that weaved the web.",['info']

A new rejection sampling method for truncated multivariate Gaussian random variables restricted to convex sets,"Statistical researchers have shown increasing interest in generating truncated multivariate normal distributions. In this paper, we only assume that the acceptance region is convex and we focus on rejection sampling. We propose a new algorithm that outperforms crude rejection method for the simulation of truncated multivariate Gaussian random variables. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalization of Von Neumann's rejection technique which requires the determination of the mode of the truncated multivariate density function. We provide a theoretical upper bound for the ratio of the target probability density function over the proposal probability density function. The simulation results show that the method is especially efficient when the probability of the multivariate normal distribution of being inside the acceptance region is low.",['math']
Context-aware approach for formal verification,"The Context-aware approach has proven to be an effective technique for software model-checking verification. It focuses on the explicit modelling of environment as one or more contexts. In this area, specifying precise requirement is a challenged task for engineer since often environmental conditions lack of precision. A DSL, called CDL, has been proposed to facilitate the specification of requirement and context. However, such language is still low-level and error prone, difficult to grasp on complex models and assessment about its usability is still mitigated. In this paper, we propose a high level formalism of CDL to facilitate specifying contexts based on interaction overview diagrams that orchestrate activity diagrams automatically transformed from textual use cases. Our approach highlights the boundaries between the system and its environment. It is qualified as model-checking context-aware that aims to reduce the semantic gap between informal and formal requirements, hence the objective is to assist and encourage engineers to put sufficient details to accomplish effectively the specification process.",['info']
TOWARDS A TRANSFORMATION APPROACH OF TIMED UML MARTE SPECIFICATIONS FOR OBSERVER-BASED FORMAL VERIFICATION,"Modeling timing constraints of distributed systems and multi-clock elec- tronic systems aims to describe different time requirements aspects at a higher ab- straction level. An important aspect is the logical time of the behavior of these systems. To model the time requirements, a specification language with multiple clock domains called Clock Constraint Specifiation Language (CCSL) has been in- troduced, in order to enrich the formalisms of existing modeling tools and also to facilitate the description and analysis of temporal constraints. Once the software has been modeled, the difficulty lies in both expressing the relevant properties and verifying them formally. For that purpose formal transformation techniques must be introduced. However, it remains difficult to exploit initial models as such, and to integrate them into a formal verification process. This paper introduces a method- ology and the original tool chain for exploiting UML MARTE models enriched with CCSL specification. These will be integrated together with a range of tools for expressing and verifying time constraints. We propose a more general translation approach that verifies not only CCSL constraints implementations but also prop- erties of the complete model including all the functional components. We evaluate our approach with a case study.",['info']

Decline in Fertility between 1980 and 2010 in the African Countries Mostly Affected by HIV/AIDS: Analysis of Individual and Group EffectsDéclin de la fécondité entre 1980 et 2010 dans les pays africains les plus affectés par le VIH/SIDA: Analyse des effets individuel et de groupe,"The decline in fertility has long been illustrated in demography and economics studies by many authors, including Karl Schwarz (1968); CANTRELLE (P.) FERRY (B.) 1979; KNODEL (J.), 1983; Bongaarts (J.), 1978, 1983-84 and 2005; JC Caldwell et al, (1989); EVINA. A, 1999; Desgrees et al, (2001); Lori S. Ashford (2006); K Bietsch and al. (2013); etc... These authors isolated the various factors that contribute significantly to the decline in fertility. Policies of birth control also contributed to the decline in fertility in the world. But all these studies and policies have not highlighted the decline in fertility due to “individual” and “group” effects, when population is affected by infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, STIs, TB, etc...). This approach of decline in fertility is certainly not new, but it is based on two assumptions which suggest that leaders of population planning have obligations and important decisions on the fight of infectious diseases. The decline in fertility is mainly related to five variables: the use of contraception, mortality, poverty, education level, and urbanization. Women's behavior determines their HIV/AIDS infection. We speak of “the individual effect of fertility decline”. Moreover, vulnerability to HIV/AIDS determines the level of female mortality. The decrease of women and child in the population due to mortality, the decline in the number of wealthy and educated women, the increase of poor and no educated women is assigned to the “group effect of fertility decline”.",['shs']
Influence of Male Decision-making and Sociocultural Factors in the use of Contraceptive Methods by Women in Niger,"Niger is one of the worldwide countries where Muslims are majorities (98.7 % of Muslims and 1% of Christians in 2006. Five Ethnicity groups are also majorities. We have as follow: Djerma Songhai (25.4%); Haoussa (42.8%); Toureg (13.2%); Kanouri, (7.7%) and Peulhs (6.9%). Six main factors have a great influence in the use of contraception: We have: the age of people, the type of place of residence, the facto place of residence, the highest educational level, religion and ethnicity. In 2012, when women decided to stop the use of contraception, the reason of last discontinuation is mainly the need of pregnancy (52.3%). In Niger, population wants more children (20.4% of women and 31.4% of men in 2006) and do not use more contraception for the moment (86.4% of women and 91.2% of men in 2012). Between 2006 and 2012, a large part of people do not intend to use contraception (50.5% of women in 2012 relative to 62.2% in 2006). Then, three main reasons are relevant to explain the very highest level of Fertility in Niger: the desire of more children, the religion prohibit and the opposition of both men and women into the use of contraception.",['shs']
"The internationalization of social sciences: distortions, dominations and prospects","Wiebke Keim uses sociology as an example that illuminatesWestern hegemony in social sciences. For her, theEuropean origin of academic disciplines within specializedinstitutions, and their later extension into the rest of theworld, has led to the marginalization of the global South’ssocial experiences and social-scientific production. Theglobal South’s sociology, in particular, still suffers fromits intellectual dependency on Western production andfrom an unequal division of labour. Researchers from theglobal South are often more devoted to empirical studiesand data collection, whereas the theoretical implicationsof these works are discussed in studies by researchers innorth-western countries. But this exclusion process goeshand in hand with an inclusion process. Indeed, Westernscience has the ambition to be universal. General socialtheory is regarded as universally valid, and social realitiesfrom all over the world are analysed with its tools, whichare essentially produced in the North. Consequently it isargued that Western social science produces a ‘distortedform of universality’.Several counter-hegemonic currents have emerged sincethe 1960s. They aim both to challenge North Atlanticdomination and to offer social sciences that are sociallyrelevant for realities which mainstream research hasnot fully taken into account. These currents seem to beenjoying a revival in the present context of internationalization.Keim notes that there is absolutelyno paradox in this, as the increase in internationalcommunication networks is likely to intensify the tensionsbetween local and general sociologies, and to stimulatespecific claims for the recognition of local social realitiesand forms of knowledge.",['shs']

Towards Distributed Solution to the State Explosion Problem,"In the life cycle of any software system, a crucial phase formalization and validation through verification or testing induces an identification of errors infiltrated during its design. This is achieved through verification by model checking. A model checking algorithm is based on two steps: the construction of state space of the system specification and the verification of this state space. However, these steps are limited by the state explosion problem, which occurs when models are large. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem to improve performance in execution time and memory space by performing the exploration of state space in a distributed architecture consisting of several machines.",['info']

Web Service Composition As Minimal Unsatisfiability,"The goal of the Web Service Composition (WSC) problem is to find an optimal composition of Web Services to satisfy a given request using their syntactic and/or semantic features, when no single service satisfies it.

In this paper, we consider WSC problem in the Software as a Service layer (SaaS) from semantic aspects, exploiting the super-type and subtype relationship among parameters. In this paper we investigate the problem of SaaS Web Service Composition. We formulate the problem of optimal composition as the problem of finding the minimal unsatisfiable set of minimum size widely studied in the context of Artificial Intelligence that encoding the composition problem.

A High-level Formalism to Elaborate Context for a Context-aware Verification Approach,"Specification of precise requirement is a key element to realize effectively the model-checking verification. In a context-aware framework, the technique is considered through a set of specific environmental conditions in the form of contexts. A DSL, called CDL, has been proposed to facilitate the specification of requirement by context elaboration. However, it still low-level, error prone, difficult to grasp on complex models and its usability is mitigated. In this paper, we propose a high level formalism of CDL to assist the specification process by describing the system requirements using interaction overview diagrams. The objective is to generate CDL models through such intermediate formalism by orchestrating activity diagrams transformed from informal use cases. Thus, the semantic gap between informal and formal requirements is reduced and engineers are helped towards formal verification.",['info']
Autonomous Robot Controllers Capable of Acquiring Repertoires of Complex Skills,"Due to the complexity and sophistication of the skills needed in real world tasks, the development of autonomous robot controllers requires an ever increasing application of learning techniques. To date, however, learning steps are mainly executed in isolation and only the learned code pieces become part of the controller. This approach has several drawbacks: the learning steps themselves are undocumented and not executable. In this paper, we extend an existing control language with constructs for specifying control tasks, process models, learning problems, exploration strategies, etc. Using these constructs, the learning problems can be represented explicitly and transparently and, as they are part of the overall program implementation, become executable. With the extended language we rationally reconstruct large parts of the action selection module of the AGILO2001 autonomous soccer robots.",['info']

CoQuiAAS: A Constraint-Based Quick Abstract Argumentation Solver,"Nowadays, argumentation is a salient keyword in artificial intelligence. The use of argumentation techniques is particularly convenient for thematics such that multiagent systems, where it allows to describe dialog protocols (using persuasion, negotiation, ...) or on-line discussion analysis, it also allows to handle queries where a single agent has to reason with conflicting information (inference in the presence of inconsistency, inconsistency measure). This very rich framework gives numerous reasoning tools, thanks to several acceptability semantics and inference policies. On the other hand, the progress of SAT solvers in the recent years, and more generally the progress on Constraint Programming paradigms, lead to some powerful approaches that permit to tackle theoretically hard problems. The needs of efficient applications to solve the usual reasoning tasks in argumentation, together with the capabilities of modern Constraint Programming solvers, lead us to study the encoding of usual acceptability semantics into logical settings. We propose diverse use of Constraint Programming techniques to develop a software library dedicated to argumentative reasoning. We present a library which offers the advantages to be generic and easily adaptable. We finally describe an experimental study of our approach for a set of semantics and inference tasks, and we describe the behaviour of our solver during the First International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation.",['info']

Synthesis of Carbon/Sulfur Nanolaminates by Electrochemical Extraction of Titanium from Ti 2 SC,"Herein we electrochemically and selectively extract Ti from the MAX phase Ti2SC to form carbon/sulfur (C/S) nanolaminates at room temperature. The products are composed of multi-layers of C/S flakes, with predominantly amorphous and some graphene-like structures. Covalent bonding between C and S is observed in the nanolaminates, which render the latter promising candidates as electrode materials for Li-S batteries. We also show that it is possible to extract Ti from other MAX phases, such as Ti3AlC2, Ti3SnC2, and Ti2GeC, suggesting that electrochemical etching can be a powerful method to selectively extract the M elements from the MAX phases, to produce AX layered structures, that cannot be made otherwise.

AGRO-MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF TWO RICE VARIETIES FROM JAPAN; ORYSA SATIVA L. AND FOUR NERICAS VARIETIES IN AN AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONE OF THE TOWN OF YAOUNDE (CAMEROON); COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THEIR PERFORMANCES,"The performances of two rice species of the genus Oryza were evaluated by considering parameters such as the number of panicle per rice plant, the number of primary branches of the panicles, panicle length, the plant height, the number of grains and empty balls per panicle. It appears that O. sativa from Japan has a number of empty balls less than NERICA’s varieties from Africa. We also noted that O. sativa has the highest number of panicles per rice plant (a mean of 14.05 ± 6.14). However, the number of grains per panicle NERICA’s varieties was very high (a mean of 164 ± 38.82) and therefore they shows more attractive characters than Orysa sativa lines. The differences were statistically significant above all the parameters considered in both African and Japan rice studied. A significant correlation that was negative has been observed between the number of panicles per rice plant and the number of primary branches per panicle within the NERICA 9 variety (P <0.05). The correlation was highly significant and positive (P <0.001) between the number of primary branches per panicle and the number of grain per panicle. These results suggest another demonstration of the hybrid vigor of NERICA varieties.","['sdv', 'sde']"
Energy Trade-offs for end-to-end Communications in Urban Vehicular Networks exploiting an Hyperfractal Model,"We present results on the trade-offs between the end-to-end communication delay and energy spent for completing a transmission in vehicular communications in urban settings. This study exploits our innovative model called "" hyperfractal "" that captures the self-similarity of the topology and vehicle locations in cities. We enrich the model by incorporating roadside infrastructure. We use analytical tools to derive theoretical bounds for the end-to-end communication hop count under two different energy constraints: either total accumulated energy, or maximum energy per node. More precisely, we prove that the hop count is bounded by O(n 1−α /(d m −1)) where α < 1 and d m > 2 is the precise hyperfractal dimension. This proves that for both constraints the energy decreases as we allow to chose among paths of larger length. In fact the asymptotic limit of the energy becomes significantly small when the number of nodes becomes asymptotically large. A lower bound on the network throughput capacity with constraints on path energy is also given. The results are confirmed through exhaustive simulations using different hyperfractal dimensions and path loss coefficients.",['info']

Domestic food market is considerably more important than export market for agricultural products. The economic value of urban and rural markets has become roughly equivalent.

Food issues can no longer be mainly focused on cereals.",['shs']
Anaemia in Ivory Coast: the advantage of a social approach,"T he nutritional situation in Ivory Coast is worrying. In this country in Subsaharan Africa, feeding of children has been at the centre of national preoccupations for several years. The combat against malnutrition is integrated into national programs intended to promote and support correct feeding of infants and young children, the protection of mothers' breastfeeding and the combat against deficiencies. However, the situation is deteriorating and the report of Landscape Analysis (2010) underlines that the causes of this deterioration are not yet well understood. In 1997, there were 35% iron deficiencies among children of preschool age, 29% of school age 45% of pregnant women. Ten years later, in 2007, there were at 50% among children of preschool age (+15 percentile points), 59% of school age (+30 points) and 58% for pregnant women (+13 points). However, early childhood is a critical period which is decisive for the continued development of the child. The PNN (National Nutrition Programme) and the WHO (World Health Organization) explain the malnutrition and deficiencies by ""bad feeding practices"" and by a lack of knowledge of nutritional recommendations. Matorel (in Dewey, 2003) adds that a high rate of infectious diseases is another direct cause of malnutrition. Apart from these factors, the deterioration of the situation is not well documented: what has concretely changed in practices? What are the recommended norms, and what are the practices which have become social norms declared by the mothers, compared with those of a generation earlier? Do these practices have a real impact on malnutrition? Instead of pointing a finger on the lack of knowledge of mothers, or on their nonobservance of the (official or elders') recommandations in terms of child's feeding, we propose to mobilize social sciences to better understand the mothers. Our results reveal that the symptoms of anaemia are well known and identified by mothers, but that a number of their believes make them ignore the causes of the disease and adopt curative treatments which are unsuitable to cure the illness. This in-depth understanding of the mothers' practices and representations can provide levers to better adapt the communication to them, and the interventions designed to fight against anaemia or malnutrition on a wider scale.",['shs']
Simulation of shot peening: From process parameters to residual stress fields in a structure,"Manufacturing industries perform mechanical surface treatments like shot peening at the end of the manufacturing chain to protect important working parts. This treatment modifies the near surface of the treated part with the introduction of compressive residual stresses due to the repeated impacts of the shot. Then, the treated part exhibits, not only a longer life, but also a better fretting behavior, an improved resistance to corrosion… The objective of the present paper is first to study the relation between the process parameters and the material state (residual stress and plastic variables…) for a complex geometry. Next, a numerical tool is proposed, able to predict this material state in a time frame that is consistent with industrial constraints. The originality of the proposed approach thus consists in the chaining of the different steps. The first step is to choose the process parameters for the shot peening process considering conventional or ultrasonic shot peening and model the shot dynamics for a complex geometry. Once the impact velocity field is known, the objective is to compute the local incompatible plastic deformation field due to the repeated impacts using analytical methods. Then, a finite element model is used to compute the residual and deformation fields in the considered mechanical part. The complete method has been performed on the model of a gear, a mechanical part that is most often shot peened and exhibits a complex geometry.",['spi']
Damage Evaluation in Woven Glass Reinforced Polyamide 6.6/6 Composites Using Ultrasound Phase-Shift Analysis and X-ray Tomography,"The paper proposes a new experimental methodology, based on ultrasonic measurements, that aims at evaluating the anisotropic damage in woven semi-crystalline polymer composites through new damage indicators. Due to their microstructure, woven composite materials are characterized by an anisotropic evolution of damage induced by different damage mechanisms occurring at the micro or mesoscopic scales. In this work, these damage modes in polyamide 6.6/6-woven glass fiber reinforced composites have been investigated qualitatively and quantitatively by X-ray micro-computed tomography (mCT) analysis on composite samples cut according to two orientations with respect to the mold flow direction. Composite samples are initially damaged at different levels during preliminary interrupted tensile tests. Ultrasonic investigations using C-scan imaging have been carried out without yielding significant results. Consequently, an ultrasonic method for stiffness constants estimation based on the bulk and guided wave velocity measurements is applied. Two damage indicators are then proposed. The first consists in calculating the Frobenius norm of the obtained stiffness matrix. The second is computed using the phase shift between two ultrasonic signals respectively measured on the tested samples and an undamaged reference sample. Both X-ray mCT and ultrasonic investigations show a higher damage evolution with respect to the applied stress for the samples oriented at 45◦ from the warp direction compared to the samples in the 0◦ configuration. The evolution of the second ultrasonic damage indicator exhibits a good correlation with the void volume fraction evolution estimated by mCT as well as with the damage calculated using the measured elastic modulus reduction. The merit of this research is of importance for the automotive industry.",['spi']
Nondestructive testing of composites using a nonlinear acoustic spectroscopy method,"The presented experimental work describes the nondestructive examination of polymer based composites using an acoustic method under the consideration of nonlinear effects. The technique is based on the fact that material behaves more nonlinearly in the presence of damage than in the undamaged state during dynamic load. Damaged structures show an increased nonlinear transmission behavior. Consequently, the level of nonlinearity is an indication of the damage severity. The aim is to analyze the nonlinear transfer behavior and if a quantification can be used to determine the damage severity. The focus is on the type of nonlinear acoustic spectroscopy methods that analyses the modulation spectrum. When two harmonic waves are applied with different frequencies to a damaged material, the amplitude of the high-frequency wave will be modulated by the low-frequency wave and the created spectrum manifests an intermodulation by showing new frequencies such as sidebands and higher harmonics. Samples made of glass fiber reinforced vinyl ester respectively epoxy, both taffeta woven, and pre-damaged by application of tensile tests using different levels of tension have been considered. A new experimental setup has been developed and a clearly visible increase of the intermodulation with increasing damage has been noticed for both materials. Finally, the method is proven to nondestructively evaluate the damage state of composites.",['spi']

A conceptual framework to better understand the role of phytobiome on field crop establishment,"Seed germination and seedling emergence are the very beginning phase of a crop cycle and thus determine success or failure of any crop establishment. This early phase is affected by five major groups of drivers namely seed and seedling characteristics, seedbed physical components, seedbed chemical components, seedbed biological components, and cropping systems. While several studies have been carried out on these drivers, they mainly focused on only one or a few factors without taking into account their overall interactions and impact on seed germination and seedling emergence. Therefore, there is a need to adopt a systems-level approach for a better understanding of these interactions and their overall effect on the quality of crop establishment. In particular, a focus is needed on the impact of cropping systems on the functioning of plant- and soil-associated organisms. It is important to combine experimental approaches, regional agronomic diagnoses and simulation modeling in order to tackle the question. Such a holistic approach will allow designing of more resilient and environment-friendly agricultural systems less reliant on synthetic inputs. Such agroecological systems are the only alternative to feed the increasing global population, on one hand, and to minimize negative impacts on the human health and biodiversity, on the other.",['sdv']
French cheesed off as 'revolutionary' lab technique ripens fromage in days,"France's top food body has unveiled a “revolutionary” laboratory process to create a range of cheeses that look and smell like the real thing in ""days rather than months"". But purists warn the move could spell “the death of true cheese”. Researchers at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research, INRA, say they have cracked a way of massively accelerating the ripening process normally so essential to creating a cheese with the required texture and smelliness. What nature takes three weeks, three months or three years to do we can do in two to three days using a process that is far faster and less costly,” INRA cheese expert Romain Jeantet told the Telegraph.Brie and Camembert take roughly a month to ripen, while a mature Comté can take up to three years. The secret to the process, which researchers have coined From'Innov, is to split the production of the cheese and its aroma in the laboratory and mix them later to create the desired product “à la carte”.“With the same material, we can thus make a cream cheese on Monday, a Camembert on Tuesday and a hard cheese on Wednesday,” said colleague Gilles Garric, who said INRA was in talks with three dairy giants over the technique. The result was very similar to traditionally-made cheese, the researchers insisted.“We can recreate a cheese that has roughly the same texture as Camembert, then we can isolate bacteria that create the typical Camembert taste. We mix the two together. In the end it will have the same shape, the same taste and same texture as Camembert” – if a little more “homogenous”, he said.To make the end product more nutritious, experts can mix in probiotics – live bacteria and yeasts.He added: “If you want to put such cheese in salads or sandwiches you will find something that tastes exactly the same but costs far less and is far faster to make.” But purists are appalled at what they see as the latest attempt to kill of a great French exception – smelly cheese lovingly made with raw milk and on a human scale.“This isn’t cheese at all, it’s totally synthetic,” sniffed Véronique Richez-Lerouge, who runs the traditional cheese defence group Association Fromages de Terroirs and recently wrote a book called La Vache Qui Pleure (Crying Cow).“Industrial dairy groups have long dreamed of making cheese with as little milk as possible in as little time as possible so it costs as little as possible, with a consensual taste to appeal to the masses. INRA has made their dream come true,” she said. “Next they’ll be adding banana or raspberry aroma.” She added: “This is yet another step towards creating dead food rather than letting nature run its course. Cheese is alive and needs to be ripened and matured over a long period, preferably with live raw milk. You cannot create this natural complexity in the laboratory. ""Humans are made to eat live food with diverse bacteria, not dead food, which causes all sorts of problems such as allergies.” French chef Arnaud Daguin said: “As a cook for 40 years and someone who is carefully about food quality there is one thing that we cannot do without: transcendence. There is no point trying to play God and outdo the natural world when we haven’t even understood a tenth of its potential.” Mr Jeantet hit back that he was a “cheese lover” with no desire to “kill off traditional cheese” but said that times had changed.“Traditional cheese has its place as a dish in its own right, generally at the end of a meal. But that use has dropped from 70 per cent in the 1970s to 50 per cent today,” he said.The rest, he said, was used for cooking, and there was a huge market for cheaper, multi-purpose cheese to rival the wildly successful mozzarella.The new technique was the best way to offer cheese tailor-made to “local tastes and requirements” in countries like China, where demand for dairy products is exploding.It also travelled well, as the cheese can be sent in powder form and the aroma separately, and mixed in situ.He insisted that the entire cheese-making process used only the normal, natural ingredients found in regular cheese.The technique will be on display at the world Cheese Symposium, which will take place in Rennes starting on Sunday.INRA will also show off a special anti-mould bacteria for fresh cream and an experimental Emmental with anti-inflammatory properties.",['sdv']
Innovation for organic Tomato: Breeding for diversity and quality,"The poster describes Solibam work on tomatoes, in France and Italy, such as the breeding schemes and the various connections between WPs. In 2010 and 2011, the main activity in WP3 consists on creating populations (genetically diverse germplasm) on two kinds of tomatoes: “Coeur de boeuf” type and “Marmande” type. These populations are generated through several targeted crosses between several landraces collected in France and Italy (in situ and ex situ collections). In 2013 and 2014, there will be two main breeding programmes: one in WP5 by seed companies (Gautier Semences and Arcoiris), on other in WP6 (Participatory Plant Breeding). In the end of the programme, there will be a comparison of these two breeding approches, including molecular analyses (WP2). All along the process, from 2011 to 2014 (and after), agronomic, organoleptic and nutritional tests are implemented to manage and guide the selection.","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"

Recycling sewage sludge on agricultural soils : economic valuation of food safety,"Parmi les déchets urbains, les boues d'épandage constituent un sérieux problème tenant tant aux aspects qualitatifs que quantitatifs des boues. Si la tendance actuelle continue, plus de 60 % des boues en France seront recyclées sur les terres agricoles. La composition des boues est aussi un sujet d'intérêt. Bien que les boues servent de fertilisants, elles contiennent généralement plusieurs micro-polluants, comme des métaux lourds qui ont tendance à s'accumuler irréversiblement dans les terres. Ceci pourrait modifier la perception qu'a le consommateur de la sécurité des produits agricoles cultivés sur ces terres. La sécurité peut être analysée comme un attribut des biens alimentaires de la même façon que la valeur nutritionnelle ou le goût. Toutefois, la sécurité alimentaire est un bien public et à cet égard n'a pas de prix explicite. Un consommateur pourrait ainsi être prêt à payer pour la sécurité alimentaire s'il perçoit qu'il existe un risque pour sa santé. La sécurité alimentaire est alors analysée comme une réduction de la morbidité, mesurée par une baisse de la probabilité d'être malade et pour laquelle le consommateur est prêt à payer le coût additionnel. Le but de cette étude est de définir le cadre théorique dans lequel le consommateur évalue la sécurité alimentaire relative à la pratique d'épandage des boues sur les terres agricoles.",['sdv']

Antigen encoded by vaccine vectors derived from human adenovirus serotype 5 is preferentially presented to CD8+ T lymphocytes by the CD8alpha+ dendritic cell subset,"Different subsets of dendritic cells (DC) elicit qualitatively different immune responses. In mice, two lymphoid tissue-resident subsets, CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha-, have been implicated in the induction of T helper 1 (Th1) or Th2 responses, respectively. Moreover, CD8alpha+ DC play a major role in priming CD8+ T lymphocyte responses to viral antigens during viral infections. These considerations have been less extensively explored for vaccine vectors derived from viruses. Despite inefficient ex vivo transduction of DC, vectored vaccines derived from human adenoviruses of serotype 5 (Ad5) elicit robust immune responses, predominantly of the Th1 orientation, in humans and mice. At present it is unknown whether Ad5 interacts with DC subsets in a differential manner, thereby influencing the quality of the elicited IR. To address this issue, successive steps (attachment, transgene expression, MHC class I antigen presentation and activation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes) involved in induction of immune responses by Ad5-based vectors were examined in CD8alpha+ or CD8alphamurine DC subsets. Although in both ex vivo and in vivo experiments CD8a+ and CD8a- DC subsets captured an Ad5-based vector to a similar extent, transgene expression and subsequent MHC class I display of a transgeneencoded antigen were more efficient in CD8alpha+ DC. Moreover, following in vivo and ex vivo transduction with an Ad5-based vaccine, antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes were more efficiently activated by CD8alpha+ DC than by CD8alpha- DC. Thus, superior antigen expression and MHC class I display in CD8alpha+ DC may contribute to preferred priming of antigen-specific CD8+ lymphocytes by Ad5-transduced CD8alpha+ DC.",['sdv']

Where is dairy cattle breeding going? A vision of the future,"Genomic selection in dairy cattle breeding is a breakthrough such as the industry has not experienced since progeny test. It will have marked consequences on genetic evaluation methodology but also, and more deeply, on the organization of breeding schemes, on expected genetic gain and relative weight of traits in breeding objectives, on the nature and distribution of some related activities such as performance recording, on the structure of breeding companies and on the emergence of new actors. Multi-breed management of selection could make it possible to share reference populations and to save resources and money. Genomic selection opens new opportunities to improve functional traits and to meet new environmental and/or societal requirements, and probably to differentiate competitors via inclusion of specific and original traits. Very large reference populations offer a unique opportunity to elucidate the genetic determinism of many traits, even complex. In the longer term, big challenges are prediction of interactions between genes, prediction of genotype x environment interactions and adaptation to particular environmental conditions. The appropriate conditions using of genomic selection should be carefully studied in developing countries, because their environment is strongly different from developed countries and because accurate phenotypes are difficult to obtain on a large and reliable scale. This paper will review some of these topics.",['sdv']
Producer organisations in the meat sector,"For the French market Dr Duvaleix-Tréguer noted striking differences between the number of recognised POs in the F&V sector (254) and in the pig sector (37). However, whereas the recognised POs in the F&V sector cover only 50% of production, in the pig sector 89% of the production are covered. Dr Duvaleix-Tréguer also described how each sector organises itself differently. Whereas in the French dairy sector 50% of production is done by cooperatives, the other 50% are done by POs, which negotiate framework agreements with industry. In the pork sector, there is a high prevalence of economic POs, but not all of them are organised in the form of a cooperative. She presented a case study on the marginal costs in hog production that distinguished between ‘independent’ POs that concentrate supply (horizontal cooperation), ‘marketing’ POs that have links with downstream operations (slaughterhouse), and ‘supply & marketing’ POs that have also links with upstream operations (feed). Members of supply & marketing POs have the lowest marginal costs (i.e. the costs of increasing or decreasing production by one head), possibly because they are mostly joined by large and efficient farms or because they can realise economies of scale for their members. Compared to the marginal costs, the output price that members of supply & marketing POs receive is relatively high. More generally, membership in POs can increase the efficiency of producers and, in particular, quality schemes that are operated by POs can increase the overall value-added in the food supply chain.",['shs']

Agroecological roots and routes,"While acknowledging the intercultural origin of agroecology, this presentation focusses on the contributions of pioneer European scholars who contributed to the development of agroecology in the past century. Five of them can be identified as significant contributors: Girolamo Azzi, Basil M. Bensin, Karl H.W. Klages, Juan S. Papadakis, and Wolfgang Tischler. Some of these a uthors refer to crop and agricultural ecology (Azzi, 1928; Papadakis, 1938), with a global vision of soil and climate conditions likely to affect yields or agricultural production as a whole. This enabled drawing worldwide maps of 18 soils, climates and and crops distribution. Attention was paid to the adaptation of crops to their environment, e.g. based on “meteorological equivalent” method described by Azzi for wheat. Papadakis (1931) contested this method, arguing that the biological effects of rainfall or temperature patterns can widely differ. He also suggested a biological classification of environmental factors, where the same “biotypes” exhibit similar development patterns. To study such biotypes, comparative trials were made in a wide range of ecologic al conditions to study the influence of various factors (including cropping methods as an ecological factor) on the relative yields of varieties. Complementary work on experimental stations would enable isolating the influence of specific factors. Bensin (1930) likely made the first use of the term agroecology, as part of a proposal to the then International Institute of Agriculture in Rome (where G. Azzi was also active in the 20’s, in the commission of agricultural meteorology and ecology). Reflecting on the role of experimental work, he draw an agroecologically based agenda for agriculture, taking into account the economic factors, and the relation between the plant and its environment, including cultivation. He proposed to designate the local variety types as “chorotypes” (from the greek chora= region), and to consider adaptations to environmental changes. He also related agroecology with other sciences and domains. Likewise, connections with geography and integration of social dimensions were also emphasized by Klages (1928). Later on, the German zoologist Tischler (1965) emphasized the biotic dimension that was missing in previous works, and further elaborated the need to understand interactions within an agroecosystem as well as the impact of agricultural management on environmental components. Interestingly all these authors had a high mobility, working in different countries and speaking various languages, also co-citing some of the other authors. Such an academic universe only forms part of the roots of agroecology, whose dynamics is more complex and also framed by social, economic and cultural dimensions. A genealogic approach should also be related with the dynamics of other disciplines, of ecologically-based agricultures and societal expectations. Since such expectations and situations differ among countries, this program should also be implemented at regional level. This is among the opened routes for the new association Agroecology Europe.",['sde']

The role of knowledge in transitions to sustainable food systems,"Knowledge is fundamental to our ability to change practices from unsustainable to sustainable ones (Grin, Rotmans and Schot, 2010). However, sustainability has often been described as a “wicked problem”, where the knowledge needed to make this transition is often inconclusive and contested (Batie, 2008; Levin et al., 2012; Peters and Pierre, 2014). These “knowledge politics” (Baert and Rubio, 2012) suggest that we should be asking important questions as we develop policy advice, such as what types of knowledge and whose knowledge is taken into consideration in the development of sustainable food systems. If we look at food systems as the value chains and institutional arrangements that connect consumption and production, we see that different actors need different types of information and are willing to trust different types of knowledge about sustainable practices. Drawing upon results from an international survey of 15 institutional innovations in linking sustainable practices with markets that was carried out by FAO and INRA, we reflect upon how these innovations are placing an emphasis on different types of knowledge as the basis for the adoption of sustainable practices. These results shed light on the type of information and knowledge required by different actors in sustainable food systems.",['sdv']

Developing Economies Optimal Exchange Rate Regime: to Float or to Peg for Morocco?,"One of the most important and recent issues for the last decade in international finance, is the choice of an optimal Exchange Rate Regime for emerging and developing countries, because it stands as the major factor in the drive for economic stability according to different studies. In this context, encouraged recently by the IMF to introduce a greater flexibility to its Exchange Rate Regime, Morocco as a small economy has already started working on the process to establish the new reform in its Exchange Rate Regime, so as pledged, it can reinforce its integration in the international financial system in order to achieve different targets of the economy. However, the transition from the actual Regime to a more flexible one is not a simple equation; that's why we intended in our paper to answer different questions related to the fundamentals of the economy through a scrupulous analysis that helps have a more clear vision on whether to float or peg the Moroccan Exchange Rate Regime.

A Preliminary Theory for Open Source Ecosystem Micro-economics,"While there has been substantial empirical work identifying factors that influence the contribution to, and use of open source software, we have as yet little theory that identifies the key constructs and relationships that would allow us to explain and predict how open source ecosystems function. What is needed is a clearly articulated and empirically validated theory of open source ecosystems. Such a theory should: • Explain why, how, and when key resources---primarily the work of developers---are attracted to or depart from a project or an ecosystem. • Explain why, how, and when projects and ecosystems move through a life cycle, from initiation, growth, maturity, and decline and death. • Explain how decisions about use are made, and how the cumulatively influence the socio-technical position of a project within an ecosystem, and the relations of ecosystems to each other.

Morocco is among the rare countries that are still preserving an active system of water transportation, through artificial underground galeries called : KHATTARA. Those works appeared in Morocco 1000 years ago, and could enlarge the arable surface and desert territories via the creation of oasis. KHATTARA were dig horizontally by hands with a smooth elevation1 that can be extended for kilometers, with the regular presence of chimney that could reach 30 meters. A real technical state-of-the-art, those channels were as precise as the current GPS systems.",['sde']

Process optimization for high-temperature aerospace applications,"Nowadays, the aircraft parts that are installed in zones subjected to temperatures between 200°C and 400°C are almost entirely metallic. Alloys based on aluminium, titanium and steel dominate these zones while composites are a no-go for this temperature range. This is due to the limitation in operating temperatures of conventional thermosets as well as the lack of economic viability of ceramic-matrix composites at temperatures below 400°C. Simulation of a known process, combined with innovative materials, might overcome the rule and increase the percentage of composites used in the ""warm"" zones of aircraft.",['spi']
Drawing quantum contextuality with 'dessins d'enfants,"In the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, there exists an inherent feedback of the measurement setting on the elementary object under scrutiny. Thus one cannot assume that an 'element of reality' prexists to the measurement and, it is even more intriguing that unperformed/counterfactual observables enter the game. This is called quantum contextuality. Simple finite projective geometries are a good way to picture the commutation relations of quantum observables entering the context, at least for systems with two or three parties. In the essay, it is further discovered a mathematical mechanism for 'drawing' the contexts. The so-called 'dessins d'enfants' of the celebrated mathematician Alexandre Grothendieck feature group, graph, topological, geometric and algebraic properties of the quantum contexts that would otherwise have been 'hidden' in the apparent randomness of measurement outcomes.","['math', 'phys']"
A Robust Pickup and Delivery Problem with Uncertain Travel Time,"This paper discusses a robust variant of the well known Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP) which we called the Robust Selective PDP (RSPDP). In this problem, a fleet composed of several vehicles with a given capacity should satisfy a set of transportation requests while respecting various constraints in relation with the precedence between suppliers and customers, the capacity of vehicles, the opening and closing times of each site. Because of all these constraints, the honoring of all requests over a given period (for example, one day) is sometimes impossible so the selective aspect consists in choosing the sites to be served. This robust variant is characterized by the presence of different scenarios used to handle the uncertain traveling time for each arc. Subject to all scenarios and constraints, the goal is to find the best solution (with the higher profit) which validates all scenarios. This study introduces the mathematical formulation for this new variant. Then, an exact and a metaheuristic approaches will be used to solve it. Several tests have been done, on new generated instances for the considered problem, in order to show the efficiency of developed methods.",['info']

Red wine clarification and stabilization,"Depending on their style, red wines can be bottled and sold very shortly after fermentation or after an aging period in tanks or barrels, the length and conditions of which depend on the intended wine profile. In most cases, clarification and stabilization treatments are needed before bottling to ensure an adequate conservation of the wine quality and characteristics. However, their extent usually decreases for aged wines due to natural clarification and stabilization. In this chapter we will describe why and when these treatments are needed, the origin of hazes and crystals formation as well as the tests and treatments available to prevent their occurrence in bottled wines. Microbiological stabilization by means of low-germ and sterile filtration or flash pasteurization will be addressed but spoilage microorganisms and alterations related to their development or additives alternative to the use of sulfur dioxide, considered in other chapters of the present book, will not be detailed.",['sdv']

Les couverts végétaux. Un atout majeur pour réduire les intrants de synthèse et augmenter les services écosystémiques au vignoble,"De manière générale, un couvert végétal se définit par une espèce ou une communauté d’espèces végétales recouvrant le sol de manière permanente ou temporaire. L’agriculteur a la possibilité de semer ces couverts, selon un choix raisonné, ou bien de laisser la végétation spontanée se développer. Il existe 3 types de couverts semés avec des objectifs différents pour l’exploitant : le couvert hivernal, installé pour faire face au phénomène d’érosion du sol important pendant cette période de repos végétatif ; les engrais verts, installés avec l’objectif d’amender naturellement la parcelle, en détruisant et en enfouissant les résidus du couvert qui libèrent ainsi de la matière organique plus ou moins rapidement, qui servira à alimenter la plante au cycle suivant, après des étapes de minéralisation ; les cultures intermédiaires pièges à nitrate (CIPAN), installées au tout début de l’automne pour capter dans le sol les nitrates en excès et des quantités d’eau importantes dans le but de limiter la lixiviation et la contamination des eaux souterraines et de surfaces par les nitrates. Les couverts et leurs intérêts en production végétale Les espèces végétales les plus couramment utilisées dans ces couverts font essentiellement partie de trois familles présentant chacune différents avantages quant à leur utilisation. Nous retrouvons : les graminées (avoine, seigle, ray grass, brome, fétuque, orge…), avantageuses avec un rapport C/N élevé, produisent une biomasse (figure 1) importante bénéfique lors de la destruction ; les brassicacées (anciennement « crucifères ») (moutarde, navette fourragère, radis chinois, colza fourrager…) servent couramment de « pompe à azote » mais aussi de biofumigateur (figure 1), ce qui peut avoir un impact négatif sur certains champignons bénéfiques du sol (champignons mycorhiziens) si la proportion est trop importante. Elles présentent l’avantage de s’implanter rapidement, empêchant le développement important des adventices (appelées également fréquemment mauvaises herbes) ; les légumineuses (vesce, féverole, trèfle, luzerne…) sont de plus en plus utilisées, seules ou en mélange, pour leur capacité à réaliser une symbiose avec des bactéries du sol, leur permettant ainsi de fixer le diazote atmosphérique. Avec un rapport C/N alors très faible, le relargage de l’azote assimilé et des nutriments se fait très rapidement, et ceux-ci deviennent donc disponibles pour la culture. Les plantes de couvert sont fortement plébiscitées en polyculture pour couvrir les parcelles lorsqu’elles ne sont pas utilisées par une culture d’intérêt. L’utilisation de ces couverts d’interculture s’est développée notamment pour contrer des phénomènes de battance et d’érosion des sols, qualifiés d’anthropogènes car liés à l’exploitation, parfois intensive, des milieux agricoles et à la destruction de la couverture végétale naturelle.",['sde']
Nanoparticles alloying in liquids: Laser-ablation-generated Ag or Pd nanoparticles and laser irradiation-induced AgPd nanoparticle alloying,"Laser irradiation of a mixture of single-element micro/nanomaterials may lead to their alloying and fabrication of multi-element structures. In addition to the laser induced alloying of particulates in the form of micro/nanopowders in ambient atmosphere (which forms the basis of the field of additive manufacturing technology), another interesting problem is the laser-induced alloying of a mixture of single-element nanoparticles in liquids since this process may lead to the direct fabrication of alloyed-nanoparticle colloidal solutions. In this work, bare-surface ligand-free Ag and Pd nanoparticles in solution were prepared by laser ablation of the corresponding bulk target materials, separately in water. The two solutions were mixed and the mixed solution was laser irradiated for different time durations in order to investigate the laser-induced nanoparticles alloying in liquid. Nanoparticles alloying and the formation of AgPd alloyed nanoparticles takes place with a decrease of the intensity of the surface-plasmon resonance peak of the Ag nanoparticles (at ~405 nm) with the irradiation time while the low wavelength interband absorption peaks of either Ag or Pd nanoparticles remain unaffected by the irradiation for a time duration even as long as 30 min. The nanoalloys have lattice constants with values between those of the pure metals, which indicates that they consist of Ag and Pd in an approximately 1:1 ratio similar to the atomic composition of the starting mixed-nanoparticle solution. Formation of nanoparticle networks consisting of bimetallic alloyed nanoparticles and nanoparticles that remain as single elements (even after the end of the irradiation), joining together, are also formed. The binding energies of the 3d core electrons of both Ag and Pd nanoparticles shift to lower energies with the irradiation time, which is also a typical characteristic of AgPd alloyed nanoparticles. The mechanisms of nanoparticles alloying and network formation are also discussed.","['spi', 'phys']"
Clustering Weekly Patterns of Human Mobility Through Mobile Phone Data,"With the rapid growth of cell phone networks during the last decades, call detail records (CDR) have been used as approximate indicators for large scale studies on human and urban mobility. Although coarse and limited, CDR are a real marker of human presence. In this paper, we use more than 800 million CDR to identify weekly patterns of human mobility through mobile phone data. Our methodology is based on the classification of individuals into six distinct presence profiles where we focus on the inherent temporal and geographical characteristics of each profile within a territory. Then, we use an event-based algorithm to cluster individuals and we identify 12 weekly patterns. We leverage these results to analyze population estimates adjustment processes and as a result, we propose new indicators to characterize the dynamics of a territory. Our model has been applied to real data coming from more than 1.6 million individuals and demonstrates its relevance. The product of our work can be used by local authorities for human mobility analysis and urban planning.",['info']
Efficient cluster-based routing algorithm for body sensor networks,"Body Sensor Networks have gained a lot of research interest lately for the variety of applications they can serve. In such networks where nodes might hold critical information about people's lives, designing efficient routing schemes is very important to guarantee data delivery with the lowest delay and energy consumption. Even though some cluster-based routing schemes were proposed in the literature, none of them offer a complete solution that guarantees energy and delay efficient routing in BSN. In this paper, we propose a robust cluster- based algorithm that increases the routing efficiency through every step of the routing process: cluster formation, cluster head election, and routing operation of data to the sink. The proposed algorithm is compared to existing cluster-based schemes, and MATLAB simulations are performed to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm with respect to delay and energy consumption.",['info']
En-Route Data Filtering Technique for Maximizing Wireless Sensor Network Lifetime,"Today, we can witness wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in action almost everywhere. Their applications are ubiquitous covering environment, medical care, military, surveillance, etc. While the potential benefits of WSNs are real and significant, there remains two major challenges to fully realize this potential: big data collection and limited sensor energy. To overcome these problems, filtering techniques over data routed to the sink should be used in such a way that they do not discard useful information. In this paper, we propose a new filtering technique dedicated to periodic sensor applications. The first filter is applied at the sensor nodes and aims to reduce their raw data based on the Pearson coefficient metric. The second filter is applied at intermediate nodes, called aggregators. It uses K- nearest neighbor clustering algorithm in order to eliminate data redundancy collected by neighboring nodes. In order to evaluate our technique, experiments on real telosB sensors have been conducted while the results showed significant energy savings and high accurate data collection compared to existing approaches.",['info']

CIPRNG: A VLSI Family of Chaotic Iterations Post-Processings for F₂-Linear Pseudorandom Number Generation Based on Zynq MPSoC,"Hardware pseudorandom number generators are continuously improved to satisfy both physical and ubiquitous computing security system challenges. The main contribution of this paper is to propose two post-processing modules in hardware, to improve the randomness of linear PRNGs while succeeding in passing the TestU01 statistical battery of tests. They are based on chaotic iterations and are denoted by CIPRNG-MC and CIPRNG-XOR. They have various interesting properties, encompassing the ability to improve the statistical profile of the generators on which they iterate. Such post-processing have been implemented on FPGA and ASIC without inferring any blocs (RAM or DSP). A comparison in terms of area, throughput, and statistical tests, is performed. The hardware pseudorandom number generation can reach a throughput/latency ratio equal to 8.5 Gbps for Zynq-FPGA and 10.9 Gbps for ASIC, being thus the fastest FPGA generators based on chaos that can pass TestU01. In particular, it is established that CIPRNG-XOR is 2.5 times faster and 5 times more efficient that almost all linear PRNGs who pass TestU01.",['info']

Nevertheless, the use of parallel clusters implies constraints such as mono-threaded process of execution, reproducibility or coherency. In this paper, our contribution is a MPI based communication schema for Parallel and Distributed MAS (PDMAS) that fits High Performance Computing (HPC) on cluster requirements. Our communication schema thus integrates agent migration between processes and it guarantees message delivery in case of agent migration.",['info']

A low phase noise microwave frequency synthesis for a high-performance cesium vapor cell atomic clock,"We report the development, absolute phase noise, and residual phase noise characterization of a 9.192 GHz microwave frequency synthesis chain devoted to be used as a local oscillator in a high-performance cesium vapor cell atomic clock based on coherent population trapping (CPT). It is based on frequency multiplication of an ultra-low phase noise 100 MHz oven-controlled quartz crystal oscillator using a nonlinear transmission line-based chain. Absolute phase noise performances of the 9.192 GHz output signal are measured to be −42, −100, −117 dB rad2/Hz and −129 dB rad2/Hz at 1 Hz, 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 10 kHz offset frequencies, respectively. Compared to current results obtained in a state-of-the-art CPT-based frequency standard developed at LNE-SYRTE, this represents an improvement of 8 dB and 10 dB at f = 166 Hz and f = 10 kHz, respectively. With such performances, the expected Dick effect contribution to the atomic clock short term frequency stability is reported at a level of 6.2 × 10−14 at 1 s integration time, that is a factor 3 higher than the atomic clock shot noise limit. Main limitations are pointed out.",['spi']
A high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator-oscillator-based 4.596 GHz frequency source: Application to a coherent population trapping Cs vapor cell atomic clock,"This article reports on the design and characterization of a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR)-oscillator-based 4.596 GHz frequency source. A 2.298 GHz signal, generated by an oscillator constructed around a thermally controlled two-port aluminum nitride-sapphire HBAR resonator with a Q-factor of 24 000 at 68 ◦C, is frequency multiplied by 2–4.596 GHz, half of the Cs atom clock frequency. The temperature coefficient of frequency of the HBAR is measured to be −23 ppm/ ◦C at 2.298 GHz. The measured phase noise of the 4.596 GHz source is −105 dB rad2/Hz at 1 kHz offset and −150 dB rad2/Hz at 100 kHz offset. The 4.596 GHz output signal is used as a local oscillator in a laboratory-prototype Cs microcell-based coherent population trapping atomic clock. The signal is stabilized onto the atomic transition frequency by tuning finely a voltage-controlled phase shifter implemented in the 2.298 GHz HBAR-oscillator loop, preventing the need for a high-power-consuming direct digital synthesis. The short-term fractional frequency stability of the free-running oscillator is 1.8 × 10−9 at one second integration time. In locked regime, the latter is improved in a preliminary proof-of-concept experiment at the level of 6.6 × 10−11 τ−1/2 up to a few seconds and found to be limited by the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected CPT resonance.",['spi']

Ensemble Clustering for Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Plants,"In this paper, we propose an unsupervised ensemble clustering approach for fault diagnosis in industrial plants. The basic idea is to combine multiple base clusterings of operational transients of industrial equipment, when the number of clusters in the final ensemble clustering (P*) is unknown. In practice, a Cluster-based Similarity Partitioning Algorithm (CSPA) is employed to quantify the co-association matrix that describes the similarity among the different base clusterings and, then, a Spectral Clustering technique embedding an unsupervised K-Means algorithm is used to find the optimum number of clusters of P* based on Silhouette validity index calculation. The identified clusters allow distinguishing different operational behaviors of the equipment. The proposed approach is verified with respect to an artificial case study representative of the signal trend behavior of an industrial equipment during shut-down operations. The obtained results have been compared with those achieved by a state-of-art approach, known as Cluster-based Similarity Partitioning and Serial Graph Partitioning and Fill-reducing Matrix Ordering Algorithms (CSPA-METIS): the results show that the novel approach is able to identify the final ensemble clustering with a lower misclassification rate than the CSPA-METIS approach.","['info', 'math']"
Empirical comparison of two methods for the Bayesian update of the parameters of probability distributions in a two-level hybrid probabilistic-possibilistic uncertainty framework for risk assessment,"In this paper, we address the issue of updating in a Bayesian framework, the possibilistic representation of the epistemically-uncertain parameters of (aleatory) probability distributions, as new information (e.g., data) becomes available. Two approaches are considered: the first is based on a purely possibilistic counterpart of the classical, well-grounded probabilistic Bayes’ theorem; the second relies on the hybrid combination of (i) Fuzzy Interval Analysis (FIA) to process the uncertainty described by possibility distributions and (ii) repeated Bayesian updating of the uncertainty represented by probability distributions. The feasibility of the two methods is shown on a literature case study involving the risk-based design of a flood protection dike.","['math', 'spi']"

La naissance en mutation. Un enjeu pour la sociologie ?,"Les naissances n’ont plus vocation à « perpétuer un monde immobile ». Elles s’inscrivent dans un monde ouvert, un environnement fait d’incertitudes et de désirs. Au-delà des mutations démographiques et de la politique en matière de natalité en France qui interviennent à une échelle macro, deux mouvements antinomiques à bien des égards ont contribué à façonner « la naissance ». La médicalisation qui a pour corollaire une professionnalisation de l’accompagnement et une organisation établie sur le modèle du risque obstétrical, inscrit la naissance dans des dispositifs prescrits faisant de la parturiente essentiellement une patiente.

"Characterisation of Physical, Spectral and Thermal Properties of Biofield treated Resorcinol","Resorcinol is widely used in manufacturing of several drugs and pharmaceutical products that are mainly used for topical ailments. The main objective of this study is to use an alternative strategy i.e., biofield treatment to alter the physical, spectral and thermal properties of resorcinol. The resorcinol sample was divided in two groups, which served as control and treated group. The treated group was given biofield treatment and both groups i.e., control and treated were analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed a significant decrease in crystallite size of treated sample i.e., 104.7 nm as compared to control (139.6 nm). The FT-IR and UV-Vis spectra of treated sample did not show any change with respect to control. Besides, thermal analysis data showed 42% decrease in latent heat of fusion. The onset temperature of volatilization and temperature at which maximum volatilization happened was also decreased by 16% and 12.86%, respectively. The significant decrease in crystallite size may help to improve the spreadability and hence bioavailability of resorcinol in topical formulations. Also increase in volatilization temperature might increase the rate of reaction of resorcinol when used as intermediate. Hence, biofield treatment may alter the physical and thermal properties of resorcinol and make it more suitable for use in pharmaceutical industry.",['sdv']

Impact of an external energy on Enterococcus faecalis [ATCC – 51299] in relation to antibiotic susceptibility and biochemical reactions – An experimental study,"Background : While spiritual and mental energies are known to man, their impact has never been scientifically measurable in the material world and they remain outside the domain of science. The present experiments on Enterococcus faecalis [ATCC –51299], report the effects of such energy transmitted through a person, Mr. Mahendrakumar Trivedi, which has produced an impact measurable in scientifically rigorous manner. Methods: Enterococcus faecalis strains in revived and lyophilized state were subjected to spiritual energy transmitted through thought intervention and/or physical touch of Mr. Trivedi to the sealed tubes containing strain, the process taking about 3 minutes and were analyzed within 10 days after incubation. All tests were performed with the help of automation on the Microscan Walkaway System in Microbiology Laboratory - accredited by The College of American Pathologists Results: The results indicated that Mr.Trivedi’s energy has changed 9 of 27 biochemical characteristics of Enterococcus faecalis along with significant changes in susceptibility pattern in 5 of 31 antibiotics. The Biotype number has changed from the original control strain giving rise to 2 different biotypes in treated samples while the external energy/treatment given was the same for all treated samples suggestive of random polymorphism as analyzed through the automated machine. Conclusions: These results cannot be explained by current theories of science, and indicate a potency in Mr.Trivedi’s energy, providing a model for science to be able to investigate the impact of spiritual energy in a rigorous manner. In lyophilized state, biochemical and enzymatic characteristics could be altered.",['sdv']

In order to test the reaction of a system to failures or extreme behaviors, it is necessary to be able to create large scale environments. Such an infrastructure must be reproducible so that several work are able to compare themselves but also capable of diversity as otherwise it would risk to lead to particular subcases. In this article, we propose a generic adaptable and reusable model of large scale workload. The original schema comes from the Google Cluster Workload Traces which is a perfect representative of large scale production workload. Contrary to most model analysis of such traces, we propose along with our model a reference implementation in order for other studies using our results to produce comparable experiments.",['info']
Effects on competition induced by periodic fluctuations in environmentEffets sur la concurrence des fluctuations périodiques de l’environnement,"De nombreux systèmes écologiques connaissent une variabilité périodique. L’étude théorique de la dynamique des populations et des communautés dans des environnements périodiques peut être étudiée à l’aide de la théorie de Floquet et de la théorie de la moyenne.

Wild fire risk in the rural-urban interfaceLe risque d'incendie dans l'interface urbain-forêt,"Rural-urban interface (RUI, synonym of WUI, wildland-urban interface) are key areas in land management and planning for wildfire risk mitigation. A tool for RUI mapping was developed to help decision makers cope with risk management. Several methods for fire-risk assessment in RUI were developed, depending on the scale, the geographical context and data availability. Methods and tools were validated based on fire simulations and are now available. In addition, projections of future risk in RUI were obtained using land cover and climate change simulations. In the next four or five decades, mitigation of wildfire risk will depend on land managers capacity to control RUI development.",['sde']

Perspectives of alfalfa in Europe,"Sustainable agriculture shall reconcile high productivity with preservation of the environment, and at the same time compete in a global market. Alfalfa can help to meet the challenges of climate change and pollution reduction, by favoring crop rotations capable of better preserving the soil and controlling weeds. The utilization of alfalfa through grazing may also reduce risks of pollution and production costs. Alfalfa will keep an important place in Europe agriculture, because it sustainably supports high quality dairy productions. These unique features can be further improved through technical and varietal innovation.",['sdv']
Towards a micro-geography of ordinary public spaces in Hồ Chí Minh City,"As key places for social mixing and interactions in the city, public spaces occupy a paradoxical position in Vietnam today. While the country seeks a deeper integration within the global economy, Hồ Chí Minh City authorities support the creation of new metropolitan landmarks by launching iconic mega-projects. Thus, the planning of vast public spaces reflects the modernisation of the country and the sought-after status of the city as an emerging metropolis. But, at the same time, the ancient profusion of ordinary forms of public spaces, much more modest in size – and sometimes called “pocket public spaces” – is increasingly threatened. Two factors can be identified. First, as far as urban planning is concerned, massive real estate projects and the construction of heavy infrastructures – such as the metro – justify the progressive disappearance of small open spaces, such as parks, small squares and alleyways. Second, regarding urban regulations, vast state programmes are also launched to “clean” public spaces, directly targeting, and more and more openly, the multiple functions of these inherited spaces and the historic diversity of their daily usages.",['shs']

A Publish/Subscribe QoS-aware Framework for Massive IoT Traffic Orchestration,"Internet of Things (IoT) application deployment requires the allocation of resources such as virtual machines, storage, and network elements that must be deployed over distinct infrastructures such as cloud computing, Cloud of Things (CoT), datacenters and backbone networks. For massive IoT data acquisition, a gateway-based data aggregation approach is commonly used featuring sensor/ actuator seamless access and providing cache/ buffering and preprocessing functionality. In this perspective , gateways acting as producers need to allocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is proposed a Publish/-Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework (PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources between aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules IoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally , the framework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled backbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users and consumers. Network resources are allocated using a Bandwidth Allocation Model (BAM) to achieve efficient network resource allocation for scheduled IoT data streams. PSIoT-Orch adopts an ICN (Information-Centric Network) PubSub architecture approach to handle IoT data transfers requests among framework components. The proposed framework aims at gathering the inherent advantages of an ICN-centric approach using a PubSub message scheme while allocating resources efficiently keeping QoS awareness and handling restricted network resources (bandwidth) for massive IoT traffic.",['info']
Evaluating CBR Similarity Functions for BAM Switching in Networks with Dynamic Traffic Profile,"In an increasingly complex scenario for network management, a solution that allows configuration in more autonomous way with less intervention of the network manager is expected. This paper presents an evaluation of similarity functions that are necessary in the context of using a learning strategy for finding solutions. The learning approach considered is based on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and is applied to a network scenario where different Bandwidth Allocation Models (BAMs) behaviors are used and must be eventually switched looking for the best possible network operation. In this context, it is required to identify and configure an adequate similarity function that will be used in the learning process to recover similar solutions previously considered. This paper introduces the similarity functions, explains the relevant aspects of the learning process in which the similarity function plays a role and, finally, presents a proof of concept for a specific similarity function adopted. Results show that the similarity function was capable to get similar results from the existing use case database. As such, the use of similarity functions with CBR technique has proved to be potentially satisfactory for supporting BAM switching decisions mostly driven by the dynamics of input traffic profile.",['info']

However, in the context of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, there is conflicting data on leucine and no data at all on citrulline.

Automatic Data Processing for Visualising Yap and Palau Trenches by Generic Mapping Tools,"Current research focus on using Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) cartographic script-ing toolset for geodata processing aimed to visualize and compare geomorphic cross-section profiles of two trenches. Study area: Yap Trench (YT) and Palau Trench (PT), two hadal trenches located in southwest Pacific Ocean. Study aim: to do automatic geomorphological modelling by digitizing profiles in a fast and precise way. This was possible using GMT based automatic data processing through modules: ""grdtrack"", ""psxy"" and ""convert"". The methodology consisted in extracting raster dataset from the SRTM15_PLUS, automated digitizing of the cross-sectional profiles on the selected segments, plotting profiles graphs for two trenches and statistical analysis on the bathymetry showing depth distribution. The results are the following. YT reaches-7,000 m, PT-6,200 m, that means that PT is shallower. YT has more abrupt slope and steep gradient of the profiles oceanward comparing to PT. For the diapason of-7000 m to-6000 m YT has 68 samples, while PT has 34 samples. PT has more samples below-6000 m, but YT has dominating depths at deeper values. In general, PT has more gentle geomorphic slope land and oceanwards, while YT has steeper slopes and deeper records. Topographic profiles of the axis of the YT have sharp V-shape while PT has U-shape which indicates more flat bottom of the YT with thin sediment cover of the axis. Development of the machine learning explains the importance of the geodata automatization. Automated cross-sectioning by GMT is more accurate, fast and less error-prone comparing to the manual process of digitizing by hand in traditional GIS. This paper demonstrated a GMT based methodology for the geomorphic modelling that can be applied both for submarine and terrestrial areas in similar works. The paper contributes to the development of the cartographic methodologies.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"

The Paradoxical Centrality of Abandonment in the Urban LifeLa centralité paradoxale de l'abandon dans la vie urbaine contemporaine城市廢棄物的核心矛盾,"Representing what is discharged, waste is logically considered peripheral, if not marginal, in contemporary urban life. As « dirt is matter out of place », thus human beings create places dedicated to contain and exclude that « dirtiness », which they want to be rid of. In private spaces, be it domestic or professional, we maintain the cleanliness of the property: organizing belongings, removing dust and disposing of waste. This ultimate physical exclusion allows one to place waste out of reach and out of sight: it is first confined to bags or assigned to containers, before to be «taken out» from our homes and placed into bigger containers, which are in turn removed from the citizens' daily view by being discharged into garbage dumps, and then buried or incinerated. The whole system of dismissing «dirty» material from places where it does not belong involves a territorialized network, whose existence maintains itself in the citizens' consciousness on a subliminal level, so that the production and transportation of waste does not contaminate the city. Indeed, the sociocultural construction of waste requires that it is kept at the same time out of sight and out of mind. I would like to ponder on the marginalization of waste in the city and its paradoxical character, by exploring the idea that this product of society is a fundamental component of public space, and therefore of contemporary urbanity.",['shs']
Prediction of the moments in advection-diffusion lattice Boltzmann method. II. Attenuation of the boundary layers via double- bounce-back flux scheme,"Impact of the unphysical tangential advective-diffusion constraint of the bounce-back (BB) reflection on the impermeable solid surface is examined for the first four moments of concentration. Despite the number of recent improvements for the Neumann condition in the lattice Boltzmann method–advection-diffusion equation, the BB rule remains the only known local mass-conserving no-flux condition suitable for staircase porous geometry. We examine the closure relation of the BB rule in straight channel and cylindrical capillary analytically, and show that it excites the Knudsen-type boundary layers in the nonequilibrium solution for full-weight equilibrium stencil. Although the d2Q5 and d3Q7 coordinate schemes are sufficient for the modeling of isotropic diffusion, the full-weight stencils are appealing for their advanced stability, isotropy, anisotropy and anti-numerical-diffusion ability. The boundary layers are not covered by the Chapman-Enskog expansion around the expected equilibrium, but they accommodate the Chapman-Enskog expansion in the bulk with the closure relation of the bounce-back rule. We show that the induced boundary layers introduce first-order errors in two primary transport properties, namely, mean velocity (first moment) and molecular diffusion coefficient (second moment). As a side effect, the Taylor-dispersion coefficient (second moment), skewness (third moment), and kurtosis (fourth moment) deviate from their physical values and predictions of the fourth-order Chapman-Enskog analysis, even though the kurtosis error in pure diffusion does not depend on grid resolution. In two- and three-dimensional grid-aligned channels and open-tubular conduits, the errors of velocity and diffusion are proportional to the diagonal weight values of the corresponding equilibrium terms. The d2Q5 and d3Q7 schemes do not suffer from this deficiency in grid-aligned geometries but they cannot avoid it if the boundaries are not parallel to the coordinate lines. In order to vanish or attenuate the disparity of the modeled transport coefficients with the equilibrium weights without any modification of the BB rule, we propose to use the two-relaxation-times collision operator with free-tunable product of two eigenfunctions Λ. Two different values Λv and Λb are assigned for bulk and boundary nodes, respectively. The rationale behind this is that Λv is adjustable for stability, accuracy, or other purposes, while the corresponding Λb(Λv) controls the primary accommodation effects. Two distinguished but similar functional relations Λb(Λv) are constructed analytically: they preserve advection velocity in parabolic profile, exactly in the two-dimensional channel and very accurately in a three-dimensional cylindrical capillary. For any velocity-weight stencil, the (local) double-Λ BB scheme produces quasi-identical solutions with the (nonlocal) specular-forward reflection for first four moments in a channel. In a capillary, this strategy allows for the accurate modeling of the Taylor-dispersion and non-Gaussian effects. As illustrative example, it is shown that in the flow around a circular obstacle, the double-Λ scheme may also vanish the dependency of mean velocity on the velocity weight; the required value for Λb(Λv) can be identified in a few bisection iterations in given geometry. A positive solution for Λb(Λv) may not exist in pure diffusion, but a sufficiently small value of Λb significantly reduces the disparity in diffusion coefficient with the mass weight in ducts and in the presence of rectangular obstacles. Although Λb also controls the effective position of straight or curved boundaries, the double-Λ scheme deals with the lower-order effects. Its idea and construction may help understanding and amelioration of the anomalous, zero- and first-order behavior of the macroscopic solution in the presence of the bulk and boundary or interface discontinuities, commonly found in multiphase flow and heterogeneous transport.",['sde']
Life Cycle Analysis of microchannel technology and compact heat exchangers for refrigeration unitsAnalyse du cycle de vie de la technologie à microcanaux et des échangeurs de chaleur compacts utilisés dans les systèmes frigorifi ques,"In the refrigeration and air-conditioning fi elds, the environmental performances of systems are frequently evaluated by using the TEWI (Total Equivalent Warming Impact) indicator. Only the greenhouse effect is taken into account in this widely used index which thus seems nevertheless to be inadequate for overall characterization, including the entire environmental impacts of a refrigeration machine during its life span, i.e. from cradle to grave. In this article, we propose to apply the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) approach in order to compare two refrigeration units, destined for use in a small agri-food application; the units have the same refrigeration-capacity characteristics and use the same refrigerant (R404A). After a detailed life cycle inventory of both systems, the results of the analysis show that the use of the microchannel technology and compact heat exchangers in such a sector enables energy savings and is environmentally friendly. It enables energy savings, a low refrigerant charge, signifi cant CO2 emissions reduction (three-fold reduction), in addition to a major decrease in other environmental impacts in terms of human health (33%), ecosystem quality (24%) and natural-resource depletion (25%).",['sde']

Walter Pater’s conception of the ‘central love-poetry of Provence’ (1860-1890),"This paper focuses on Walter Pater’s approach of Provençal poetry. Pater associated the poetry of the troubadours with “antinomianism” – a religious rebellion which to him was a “Renaissance” already at work in the Middle Ages. Pater envisions this reaction against religion as a sensuous and physical liberation that originated in religion itself and brought about “a rival religion with a new rival cultus” (“Poems by William Morris”, 1868). He considers the story of Aucassin and Nicolette as a late representative of Provençal poetry, in which religion is replaced by “earthly passion, with its intimacy, its freedom, its variety – the liberty of the heart” (“Two Early French Stories”, 1872). Pater also discerns a whole aesthetic and poetical tradition that comprises the poets of Provence as well as Abelard and Dante in order to inscribe the contemporary school of “aesthetic poetry” within that very tradition, with Morris and Rossetti as prominent figures of that school. Studying their love poetry, Pater states that Morris and Rossetti were inspired by the themes and the peculiar aesthetic of that Provençal tradition – which are characterized by themes of sadness, madness and unrequited love. Pater’s construction of the poetry of Provence in fact contributes to his critical project – defining “Aestheticism” and legitimizing contemporary controversial poets such as Morris and Rossetti. And his discourse on medieval poetry is characterized by very personal aesthetic motifs.",['shs']
Numerical Computation of Fission-Product Poisoning Build-up and Burn-up Rate in a Finite Cylindrical Nuclear Reactor Core,"All fission products are classified as reactor poisons because they absorb neutrons to some extent, most of which buildup slowly as the fuel burns up and eventually constitutes a long term reactivity effect in the core. Amidst the numerous fission fragments produced per fission, the presence of Xenon-135 and Samarium-149 has the greatest effect on a reactor core multiplication factor because of their large absorption cross-sections. In this study, we present a modified one-group time independent neutron diffusion equation using the method of Eigen functions and also provided an algorithm to calculate the temperature variations of the neutron fluxes. The solution obtained from the diffusion equation was used to determine the initial thermal neutron flux needed for the reactor startup. The four basic fission-product poisoning buildup and burn-up rate equations were solved using direct integration method and constant flux approximation over a particular time interval. Furthermore, a computer algorithm called Java code for Fission-Product Poisioning Build-up and Burn-up (Jac-FPPB) code was designed to calculate the temperature variations of the neutron fluxes, fission-isotopes cross sections and the atom concentrations of the fission products over a given time interval. The result from Jac-FPPB code show that the neutron fluxes and neutron energies increase as the temperature of the fuel increases. In addition, the computed atom concentrations of each fission isotopes at any given time interval show that the isotopes increasingly build up steadily at the initial time interval and rises to a constant level where the buildup rate of the isotopes approximately equals its burn up rate. This study concluded that the designed algorithm (JaC-FPBB code) proved efficient as it could compute the build-up and burn-up rates for the two important fission fragments in a nuclear reactor core. The code is easily accessible and can serve as a tool for the development of nuclear energy in developing countries, especially Nigeria.","['spi', 'phys']"

Correlating University Students' Academic Attainment and Sense of Hope in Science Education: A survey from a Nigerian University,"Existing contexts within the Nigerian higher education system have taken a toll on the extrinsic motivation of students. In view of the effect of these dynamics on the overall objective of science education, students’ sense of hope holds a unique significance for academic wholeness. This study employs an ex post facto research design to examine the relationship between science education students’ sense of hope and their academic achievement. The sample comprises 69 second-year students drawn from the science education programmes of a federal university in North Central Nigeria. The Trait Hope Scale and student written responses on personal motivation for science education provided data that were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, t-test, correlation, and thematic analysis. The findings reveal overall high mean scores for sense of hope (x ̅=51.812, SD = 6.687), a weak positive correlation between hope and students’ CGPA that was not statistically significant, and broad desire for acquiring knowledge for society building.

Compromise duality between mobile reading and stationary reading: An analysis of culture of the media nomadism,"The research is an attempt to answer the question how far the mobility manages to preserve the cognitive and the social status of the reader and to minimize the negatives of the “technological” reading. Object of the research: the new phase in the changes of the reader’s practices that have occurred with the massive use of mobile communication devices. By the notion “mobile reading“ the author mark the perception of text from a portable or from a mobile digital device and with the notion “stationary reading“ – the perception of text from a fixed medium as a print media and as a desktop device. Purpose of the research: to prove that the mobility is the newest, natural and indestructible stage in the evolution of the reading, within the frames of which are passing mixed transformations, inherent as a whole to the „culture of the nomadism”. Methodology: there are used the methods of the analytic and synthetic processing of primary and secondary resources, the selective monographic method, analysis of combination of statistical data and information from a survey of the National Bulgarian Institute of Statistics for access and use of Internet and the results of two world researches – „Reading in the Mobile Era: A study of mobile reading in developing countries” of UNESCO and „Mobiles for Reading: A Landscape Review” of USAID and JBS. Hypothesis: the new format of the mobile reading (counterpoint of stationary reading) is not a random phenomenon, but a regular and cyclical metamorphosis in the evolution of the communications. Results: the analysis shows an approximately equal correlation between the positives and the negatives of the reading from mobile devices. The suggestion of the author is the reader’s behavior of the mobile citizen to be formed in „compromise duality” – the information, the data, the facts, the references can be assigned to „mobile” modalities, but the knowledge, the learning, the aesthetic delight of the text to be preserved in „stationary modality”.","['scco', 'shs']"

Utilisations des MOOC : éléments de typologie.,"C’est un constat partagé à travers le monde qui représente le point de départ de ce travail de recherche : les taux de certification des MOOC, compris comme le pourcentage des inscrits qui obtiennent l’éventuel certificat gratuit, sont généralement inférieurs à 10% (Koller et al., 2013 ; Ho et al., 2014). En d’autres termes, l’attrition des MOOC, définie comme la proportion des non-certifiés, est bien supérieure à celle observée dans le contexte de la formation à distance payante. La gratuité de ces cours, et par conséquent l’absence de perte économique que constitue un arrêt du suivi du MOOC, ne saurait constituer une explication pleinement satisfaisante de cet état de fait. Par ailleurs, cette caractéristique ne permet pas d’interpréter les différences de taux de certification observées d’un cours à l’autre. Nous avons cherché, dans le cadre de cette thèse, à qualifier et quantifier les différentes formes d’attrition, c’est-à-dire des différents cas de figure correspondant à la non-obtention du certificat par un inscrit, ainsi qu’à identifier certains des mécanismes qui les sous-tendent.

"GMT Based Comparative Geomorphological Analysis of the Vityaz and Vanuatu Trenches, Fiji Basin","The study is geographically focused on the two deep-sea trenches: Vanu-atu and Vityaz, Fiji Basin, East Australia, located in the area of the double conver-gent complex boundary of Pacific and Indo-Australian plates in the North Fiji back-arc basin. Complex geophysical settings results in the formation of the trenches, seismicity, geodynamic complexity and instability of the region. The work aimed at modelling and comparative statistical analysis of the bathymetry and geomorphology of two trenches. Technically, the methodology of this work is based on the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) using cartographic mapping of the geophysical, tectonic and geological settings, 2D and 3D modelling, visualizing raster grids GEBCO, ETOPO1, ETOPO5. Histogram topographic equalization (equalized, normalized, quadratic) was done using module 'grdhisteq'. Modelling geoid and gravity was based on EGM96 by sequence of GMT modules. The cross-spectrals of 2D binary raster grids were compared and their coherency plotted by 'grdfft'. The automated cross-sectioning was done using 'grdtrack' module. The results include modelled transects visualizing trenches asymmetry, bathymetric and geomorphic variations. Vityaz Trench is shallower with depths <-6,100 m, has 'bell-shape' data distribution with two peaks at ranges-3,500 m to-3,700 m, and-4,800 m to-5,000 m. Vanuatu Trench reaches up to-7,000 m with majority of values between-5,000 m to-3,000 m, even data distribution with depth increasing at-2,200 m to-800 m. Geomorphic form of both trenches varies: Vityaz has flat wide bottom similar to a trough, steeper gradient eastern slope. Vanuatu has V-form classic shape with gentle shapes on both slopes. Selected segment of Vityaz has shallower depths with maximal <-5,000 m while Vanuatu is deeper (-6,000 m). Cartographic functionality of the GMT is presented by various cartographic projections: Mercator, Behrman, Cylindrical Stereographic, Hammer retroazimuthal. 3D modelling was done using GMT module 'grdview'.

Environmental archaeology,"Environmental archaeology is concerned with the human ecology of the past, the relationship between past human populations and their physical, biological and socio-economic environment. The techniques of the discipline are the analysis and interpretation of biota (animal and plant remains) within the depositional environment of the archaeological site and its surrounds (sediments and soils). It encompasses a range of interconnecting sub-disciplines, including primarily geoarchaeology (the study of soils, sediments and geomorphological features), zooarchaeology (the study of animal remains), and archaeobotany (the study of plant remains).",['shs']
Toward anticipatory ubimus,"This paper explores the emerging initiatives in ubiquitous music research that employ anticipatory systems. We provide a short introduction to the ubimus field, highlighting the differences with other technologically based approaches to music making. One of the objectives of ubimus research is to expand the range of the stakeholders that participate in creative music making. This is achieved through the development of metaphors for creative action by means of sociotechnical systems that target creativity, including ecologically based creative practices, interaction aesthetics, computational thinking and dialogics applied to music. Another objective entails a push for new forms of music making through the reappropriation of extant technologies or through the design and deployment of new behavioral, material or social resources tailored for ubiquitous music ecologies. Nevertheless, so far, few projects have considered the future creative actions as an object of research. This is the aim of anticipatory ubiquitous music.",['shs']
Discretization of an adaptive prediction model using a non-homogeneous meshingDiscrétisation d'un modèle de prédiction adaptative cas d'un maillage non homogène,"In a previous work, we have developed a model based on 2D diffusion equations which was discretized on homogeneous meshes taking into account the mobility of entities in an existing prediction model. This model does not fit with the reality of administrative boundaries. The purpose of this paper is to deal with a more realistic approach where the boundary of the study regions are irregular. The work is done in a meshing imposed by the geographical configuration of the administrative divisions and the discretization is done with the finite volumes method for complex geometries. The validation is done using a set of administrative divisions through a multi-agent system and a shapefile extracted in a geographic information system were the modified SIR epidemiological model is applied to highlight the dynamic effect in the spread.Dans un travail précédent, nous avons développé un modèle basé sur des équations de diffusion 2D qui a été discrétisé sur un maillage homogène en tenant compte de la mobilité des entités dans un modèle de prédiction existant.

Le travail se fait dans un maillage imposé par la configuration géographique des divisions administratives et la discrétisation se fait avec la méthode des volumes finis pour les géométries complexes. La validation est effectuée à l'aide d'un ensemble de divisions administratives à travers un système multi-agents et un fichier de formes extrait dans un système d'information géographique où le modèle épidémiologique SIR modifié est appliqué pour mettre en évidence l'effet dynamique de la propagation.","['info', 'math']"
Analysis and Modelling of Passive device degradation for a long-term electromagnetic emission study of a DC-DC converter,"Past works showed that the degradation of the passive components caused by aging could induce failures of electronic system, including a harmful evolution of electromagnetic compatibility. This paper presents the impact of the accelerated thermal aging on the electromagnetic emission (EME) of a buck DC-DC converter. The experimental analysis indicates that the aging degradation of several passive components (electrolytic capacitor and powder iron inductor) is the main source of EME evolution. Based on experimental measurement and physical analysis, the empirical degradation models of related passive devices are proposed. The overall objective of this study is to predict the electromagnetic emission evolution of a buck DC-DC converter under a thermal aging, by using these passive device degradation models. 1. Introduction The consideration of the electromagnetic robustness (EMR) of integrated circuits (IC) appeared in these last years, i.e. the evolution of parasitic emission and susceptibility to electromagnetic interferences with time for electronic devices working in harsh environments. Publications such as [1] have demonstrated that the electromagnetic emission (EME) of digital circuits and I/O buffers changes with time because of the activation of intrinsic degradation mechanisms. As presented in a few works, the simulation can be utilized to predict the long-term EMC behavior. For example, in [2], the simulation results confirmed the evolution of the electromagnetic susceptibility of a phase-locked loop before and after aging stress. A switch-mode power supply (SMPS) is selected as the device under test in this study. Because of their high power efficiency, switch-mode power supplies are widely used in electronic applications [3]. However, one main drawback of SMPS is the noise delivered by the switching activity, responsible for conducted and radiated electromagnetic emission. In this way, the management of the parasitic emission of SMPS is a frequent topic in the literature on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Various papers dealt with the origin and the modeling of electromagnetic emission, and also the development of design guidelines to improve these issues [4] [5]. Several recent studies presented the long-term behavior of SMPS. Due to the degradation of the electrolytic capacitor which is used to filter the output voltage of SMPS, an increase of the ripple of the output voltage of SMPS was illustrated in [6] [7]. Another consequence is the increase of electromagnetic emission, as shown in [8], where the increase of the EME of a DC-DC converter after thermal stress is associated with the degradation of output filtering passive devices, not only the capacitor but also the inductor in the output side. As a following study of [8], this paper focuses on",['spi']

La diffusion Raman exaltée de surface (DRES) ou SERS en anglais (surface enhanced Raman scattering) permet de surmon-ter cette limitation en amplifiant le signal Raman [1].

The aim was to study how sustainability commitments and new consumer's expectations are taken into account by the stakeholders. The landscapes (particularly meadows) play a key-role, as a link between the product and the territory which it originates. The product is the main element of the message and is often ""oversized"".

"Efficient Collaboration between Government, Citizens and Enterprises in Commons Telecommunication Infrastructures","Public administrations, citizens and enterprises are the three key players for the construction and management of any commons infrastructure. This paper discusses the interrelations between them, under the lens of the ongoing netCommons project, an H2020 research project entirely devoted to multidisciplinary research on Community Networks (CN). In June 2016 netCommons organized a workshop in Barcelona (Spain), to share views and discuss how these three actors can strengthen ties among them to contribute to the growth of community networks. The workshop analyzed tools ranging from governance strategies and regulation to implementation (at deployment and operation level) of networking infrastructures. Special attention was devoted to optical fiber, a key technology for achieving the coverage and penetration targets of the European Digital Agenda. Based on the experience and the work done so far, the workshop expanded the knowledge about this type of collaboration and identified specific lines of action to make CNs more e-cient in the future. The workshop was divided in three panels: governance, regulation, and implementation, with participants from the research field, public administration and practitioners that daily build CNs. We report about the topics discussed and some of the lessons learned during the workshop. 1 Motivation For the last century telecommunications has been a key infrastructure for societal development. The traditional model has been public or private enterprises in charge of developing, maintaining, operating the infrastructure and also providing services to customers: all citizens, anywhere in a territory. These infrastructures have been the core of a tussle between three key actors: citizens, companies and organizations willing to communicate, governments and public administrations with the mandate of regulating the public space and the rights of citizens and consumers, and the private interests of the service providers, typically driven by business interests. In the last decade, local initiatives have developed citizen-driven cooperative and self-organized e↵orts to develop network infrastructures for digital sovereignty and ensure the rights of communication and participation in the digital society: to connect the unconnected, or to provide sustainable and inclusive alternatives. As context matters, in this workshop we have focused on the European scenario and particularly in the scope of Spain and the guifi.net community network. Successive workshops in di↵erent regions and community networks will allow us draw a comparison across them. The aim of the workshop 1 was to build a shared understanding and find ways to optimize the interaction among these three actors, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the development of community networking infrastructures. Based on the experience and the work done so far, the workshop had two concrete objectives: i) expand knowledge about this type of collaboration and ii) identify specific lines of action to make them more ecient in the future. During the meeting these challenges were analyzed and discussed successively from the point of view of governance 2 , regulation, and its implementation, dedicating to each block a total of one and half hour with a set of short presentations and one panel session. 1 http://netcommons.eu/?q=content/workshop-community-networking-infrastructures. 2 Links to videos of each session (with English subtitles for non-English talks): S1 Governance, S2 Regulation, S3 Implementation.",['shs']
"An a posteriori-based, fully adaptive algorithm with adaptive stopping criteria and mesh refinement for thermal multiphasecompositional flows in porous media","We consider in this work thermal multiphase multicomponent flows in porous media. We derive fully computable a posteriori error estimates for the dual norm of the residual supplemented by a nonconformity evaluation term. The estimators are general and valid for a variety of discretization methods. We also show how to estimate separately the space, time, linearization, and algebraic errors giving the possibility to formulate adaptive stopping and balancing criteria. Moreover, a space--time adaptive mesh refinement algorithm based on the estimators is proposed. We consider the application of the theory to an implicit finite volume scheme with phase-upwind and two-point discretization of diffusive fluxes. Numerical results on an example of real-life thermal oil-recovery in a reservoir simulation illustrate the performance of the refinement strategy and in particular show that a significant gain in term of mesh cells can be achieved.",['math']
A Chemical Approach to Raise Cell Voltage and Suppress Phase Transition in O3 Sodium Layered Oxide Electrodes,"Sodium ion batteries (NIBs) are one of the versatile technologies for low‐cost rechargeable batteries. O3‐type layered sodium transition metal oxides (NaMO2, M = transition metal ions) are one of the most promising positive electrode materials considering their capacity. However, the use of O3 phases is limited due to their low redox voltage and associated multiple phase transitions which are detrimental for long cycling. Herein, a simple strategy is proposed to successfully combat these issues. It consists of the introduction of a larger, nontransition metal ion Sn4+ in NaMO2 to prepare a series of NaNi0.5Mn0.5− y Sn y O2 (y = 0–0.5) compositions with attractive electrochemical performances, namely for y = 0.5, which shows a single‐phase transition from O3 ⇔ P3 at the very end of the oxidation process. Na‐ion NaNi0.5Sn0.5O2/C coin cells are shown to deliver an average cell voltage of 3.1 V with an excellent capacity retention as compared to an average stepwise voltage of ≈2.8 V and limited capacity retention for the pure NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 phase. This study potentially shows the way to manipulate the O3 NaMO2 for facilitating their practical use in NIBs.","['chim', 'phys']"
Advanced Materials from Microbial Fermentation: the Case of Glycolipids and NanocelluloseMatériaux avancés issus de la synthèse microbienne : exemples des glycolipides et de la nanocellulose,"Green chemistry is a recent discipline ruled by twelve founding principles, which include, among others, atom economy, the prevention of pollution via environmentally friendly chemical synthesis methods, such as, for example, the choice of an aqueous medium over organic solvents, but also the development of chemicals and materials derived from plant biomass. In this context, microbial synthesis is a tool to supplant, in some notable cases, syntheses by a standard organic chemistry approach. More recently, attention has begun to be given to the microbial synthesis of polymeric sugars, such as dextran or cellulose, or lipids, such as amphiphilic glycolipids. Although the microbial production of glycosylated compounds can be traced back by several decades, the development of green chemistry is encouraging teams of multidisciplinary researchers to focus on production, diversification, and applications of this class of compounds, thus going beyond the community of researchers in microbiology, historically interested in the development of fermentation products from microorganisms. This article develops the above-mentioned theme by focusing on nanocellulose, representing an important glycosylated polymer, and on biosurfactants, in regards of the glycosylated lipids. The choice of these two systems is justified by the strong development of nanocellulose-based materials but also by the need to replace in part the “conventional” surfactants, a significant source of CO2 emissions worldwide. The main classes of molecules, the classical methods of synthesis, their properties and some examples of notorious applications are presented.La chimie verte est une discipline relativement récente régie par douze principes fondateurs, incluant notamment l’économie d’atomes, la prévention de la pollution via des méthodes de synthèse chimique respectueuses de l’environnement, comme par exemple celles privilégiant le milieu aqueux aux solvants organiques, mais aussi le développement de produits chimiques et matériaux issus de la biomasse végétale.

Effective resolution in ocean models,"The increase of model resolution naturally leads to the representation of a wider energy spectrum. As a result, in recent years, the understanding of oceanic submesoscale dynamics has significantly improved. Also, the ubiquity of upper ocean frontal dynamics driving a direct energy cascade is now acknowledged. In the forward cascade framework, numerical and physical closures are more consistent in principle, but dissipation in submesoscale models remains dominated by numerical constraints rather than physical ones. Therefore, effective resolution can be defined by its numerical dissipation range, which is a function of the model numerical filters (assuming that dispersive numerical modes are efficiently removed). The COMODO project gathers the whole French ocean modeling community in order to assess current nu- merical methods and guide the development of future models. Within this framework, we present an idealized ACC-type Jet case, which provides a controllable test of a model capacity at resolving submesoscale dynamics. We compare analyses performed on simulations from two models, ROMS and NEMO, at different mesh sizes (from 20 to 1 km). Through a spectral decomposition of kinetic energy and its budget terms, we identify the characteristics of turbulent cascade, numerical dissipation, and effective resolution. It shows that numerical dissipation appears in different parts of a model, especially in spatial advection-diffusion schemes for momentum equations (KE dissipation) and tracer equations (APE dissipation) and in the time stepping algorithms.","['math', 'sde', 'phys']"
Magnetic devices analysis by Face FEM coupled with standard reluctance networkAnalyse de dispositifs magnétiques par le Éléments Finis de Facette (FFEM) couplée à un réseau à réluctance standard,"A Finite Element Method (FEM) mesh is converted to a reluctance network through an original magnetostatic formulation based on face shape functions. This meshed reluctance network is coupled with an standard one, characterizing a 0D system. Both approaches are fully-compatible and the hybridized problem can be solve with a single circuit solver. The approach is tested in 2D on a magnetic circuit with an air gap and compared to classical FEM nodal formulation. Index Terms-Reluctance network, Finite Element Method (FEM), face shape functions, Face FEM I. INTRODUCTION Optimizing electromagnetic devices can require a large amount of data that might be provided by numerical simulations. Many numerical methods are used to model electromagnetic devices, but the RNM (Reluctance Network Method) and FEM (Finite Element Method) are the most widely used for magnetostatic modeling. The FEM is well known by its flexibility and generality, once the mathematical formulations are based on a mesh. Furthermore, it is noticeable the knowledge base available for this method, for instance [1]. However, it leads to an high number of degrees of freedom and so quite long computation times. On the other hand, the RNM is one of the most primitive methods for magnetic modeling and its application is based on a reluctance network. This method has remained useful due to its coherent results obtained with low computational effort and low computational simulation time [2] and has been largely applied to model power transformers [3] [4]. This method is also largely applied to model rotating electrical machines [5][6][7] and transmission lines [8]. Nevertheless, it is important to notice that these applications are based on a reluctance network defined manually, that might imply an hard, long and non-general task. In [9] is presented a methodology that couples nodal/edge FEM with external reluctances network. In this paper, we go a step forward by proposing a formulation fully-compatible with both numerical approaches and solved with a single 0D circuit solver. Finally, the results of modeling a actuator with the classical nodal FEM and with the proposed methodology are compared.","['info', 'spi']"
Federating Community Networks: A case study from France,"Coordinating various Community Networks (CNs) with different models and governance features can be a challenge. In France, an acknowledged success of the CN movement was the creation in 2011 of Fédération French Data Network (FFDN), a federation uniting CNs across the country. When FFDN was established, interest in grassroots communication networks managed as a commons was booming, and rather than growing existing ones, swarming (i.e. the creation of several independent local organisations) was deemed a better strategy. Although communities in other states have explored other forms of coordination, this process of federation provides an interesting model for ensuring the coordination of various CNs with different models, and for establishing solidarity and fostering resiliency in the face of the many challenges entailed buy the maintenance and defence of CNs. This chapter posits that, despite some difficulties, FFDN represents an interesting precedent for other national and regional CN environments willing to foster collective cohesion. We start by offering a brief history of the CN movement in France up to the creation of Fédération FDN in 2011, before surveying the federation's main organisation features and accomplishments.",['shs']

Beauty at the Service of Humanity.La belleza al servicio de la humanidad.La beauté au service de l'humanité.La bellezza al servizio dell'umanità.,"Body modifications made with an eye towards attaining 'beauty' have been the subject of much debate by social scientists. Facing the tendency to judge beauty practices as an expression of superficiality, vanity or social 'oppression', this paper aims to approach aesthetic treatments in recognising their inherent complexity. First of all, I display an original perspective on these practices based on the theory of anthropo-poiesis, the theoretical mark proposed by the cultural anthropologist Francesco Remotti. As inferred by this author, concern with beauty can be read symbolically as an effort to grant subjects to pass into ontological categories of 'human-beingness'. In this regard, aesthetic procedures are demanded to resolve the feeling of 'incompleteness' or to face a condition of social marginality. Through the presentation of two field cases, the 'psycho-socio-aesthetics' and the 'humanitarian cosmetic surgery', I propose to focus the viewpoint of beauty practitioners who agree in considering aesthetic enhancements as their cathartic objectives to evacuate uneasiness and suffering. In consequence, I argue that aesthetic treatments should be recognised as practices of well-being, since their aim is to enhance user's psychological and social life. Lastly, I affirm the need to value ethics as a complementary skill to individuate appropriate conditions into which practices of beauty-care should take place.",['shs']

"Cartographic Interpretation of the Seafloor Geomorphology Using GMT: a Case Study of the Manila Trench, South China Sea","The study is geographically focused on the Manila Trench, located in the west Pacific Ocean, South China Sea, west Philippines. The research aims at the geological mapping, analysis and visualizing variations in the submarine geomorphology of the Manila Trench. Technically, the work was done using Generic Mapping Tools scripting toolset (GMT). A combination of various GMT modules was applied for geospatial modelling. Methodology includes cartographic data integration and interpretation through approaches of data analysis: topographic plotting, geophysical modelling, geological mapping and statistical analysis. The data included SRTM, ETOPO1, geoid and gravity grids (CryoSat-2, Jason-1). Two sets of the cross-section profiles of the trench were automatically digitized. The profile transects were compared and differences in the geomorphic shape in southern and northern parts revealed. Southern part has steeper slope on the western part. Northern part is steeper on the continental slope part. The submarine terraces are located on the northern segment at depths-2,000 m. The depth and geomorphology of the slope vary for the range-3,500 to-4,500 m: minimals for the northern part with 526 samples (18.2%) for the depths-4,000 to-4,200 m. The histogram for the northern part has bimodal distribution with two peaks. The southern part shows 142 values for the minimals-3,500 to-3400 m. The statistical analyses revealed that northern part of the trench is deeper. The GMT functionality shown in this paper enabled integration and interpretation of the multi-source data: automatically digitized profiles, geological mapping, 2D and 3D bathymetric modelling, statistical analysis, mathematical approximation of the trend modelling. The GMT proved to be capable of visualizing geodata that can significantly improve Earth studies and interpretation of submarine geomorphology of the oceanic trenches through the advanced data analysis.","['info', 'phys']"

Pharmaceutical counsulting: a (very) strong value-added shift on the transformation of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals The multichannel offer of retail pharmacists,"Retail pharmacist missions go further than simple distribution or administration of drugs: improving the health of patients by using the most appropriate pharmacotherapy, maximizing the contribution of pharmacists from the health care team, integrating care and pharmaceutical services in all health care areas and now/more recently contributing to form a government policy that integrates these healthcare models and payments into health care benefits. The Hospital Patient Territories bill ensures that retail pharmacists “contribute to primary care and participate in the cooperation between health professionals"" and provide them with the “role of general pharmacist towards certain patients” (art.38). From simple advice to admitting someone in an emergency room, including basic primary care, the pharmacist uses his health care professional skills to serve the patient while referring to their GP. He can also suggest benefits designed to encourage the improvement or upholding of someone’s health. The transition from collective doctors to an individual doctor based on personal needs will accelerate the transformation of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.",['shs']
Contractors and Linear Matrix Inequalities,"Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) comprise a large class of convex constraints. Boxes, ellipsoids, and linear constraints can be represented by LMIs. The intersection of LMIs are also classified as LMIs. Interior-point methods are able to minimize or maximize any linear criterion of LMIs with complexity, which is polynomial regarding to the number of variables. As a consequence, as shown in this paper, it is possible to build optimal contractors for sets represented by LMIs. When solving a set of nonlinear constraints, one may extract from all constraints that are LMIs in order to build a single optimal LMI contractor. A combination of all contractors obtained for other non-LMI constraints can thus be performed up to the fixed point. The resulting propogation is shown to be more efficient than other conventional contractor-based approaches. Read More: http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1115/1.4030781",['spi']
KriQL: a query language for the diagnosis of transition systems,"The formal verification of a concurrent system with a model-checker provides the user with a counterexample trace when a property is violated; however the problem diagnosis still remain a complex issue. Diagnosis is made difficult for several reasons: the trace conforms to a structure that is internal to the verification tool and hence hard to exploit, the trace yields low-level information, the trace size can be large. Traces cannot be understood without the Labelled Transition System (LTS) underlying the model-checker exhaustive exploration; we designed KriQL a query language over the LTS graph featuring a blend of set filters and graph-based operations and we implemented some feasibility prototypes. Benchmark results indicate that a hybrid management system using a graph-based database and dedicated data structures should achieve sufficient performances.",['info']

The overall wear performance, which is obtained by considering the wear loss of the substrates, indicated less resistance against Alumina compared to WC ball contact.",['spi']
"Having it all, for all: child-care subsidies and income distribution reconciled","This paper studies the design of child-care policies when redistribution matters. Traditional mothers provide some informal child care, whereas career mothers purchase full time formal care in the market. The sorting of women across career paths is endogenous and shaped by a social norm about gender roles in the family. Via this social norm traditional mothersinformal child care imposes an externality on career mothers, so that the market outcome is inefficient. Informal care is too large and the group of career mothers is too small so that inefficiency and gender inequality go hand in hand. In a first-best, full information word redistribution across couples and efficiency are separable. Redistribution is performed via lump-sum transfers and taxes which are designed to equalize utilities across all couples. The efficient allocation of child care is obtained by subsidizing formal care at a Pigouvian rate. However, in a second-best settings, we show that a trade-off between the reduction of gender inequality and redistributive considerations emerge. The optimal uniform subsidy is lower than the Pigouvianlevel. Under a nonlinear policy the first-best Pigouvianrule for the (marginal) subsidy on informal care is reestablished. While the share of high career mothers continues to be distorted downward for incentive reasons, this policy is effective in reconciling the objectives of reducing the child care related gender inequalities and achieving a more equal income distribution across couples.",['shs']

La relation de soin à l'épreuve du mensonge,"Réfléchir à la relation de soin au cœur de la santé incite à envisager la communication qui s’établit entre le soignant et le soigné et ainsi à réfléchir au grand thème de la vérité. Le rapport du médecin à son malade est-il systématiquement marqué du sceau du discours vrai ? Le contexte légal et social, valorisant l’information claire, loyale et appropriée et consacrant le principe de l’autonomie du patient, tend à faire de la vérité l’exigence même de toute relation. Pour autant, est-il seulement envisageable de livrer chaque élément au patient dès lors que celui-ci est connu du soignant ? Comment en pratique, faire avec des vérités parfois difficiles à dire (pour le soignant) mais aussi et surtout, dures à entendre (pour le patient) ? Comment le praticien peut-il jauger de la capacité qu’aurait le malade à accueillir une information, potentiellement grave, parfois condamnante et souvent violente ? Le peut-il seulement ? Ces interrogations viennent effleurer le thème du mensonge qui peut exister au sein des relations liant les individus dans le monde du soin. Quelle place possède ce mensonge et surtout quel est-il ? De la part du médecin, peut-on l’accepter et l’assumer sans risquer de retomber dans une forme de paternalisme niant la liberté individuelle du patient ? Pire encore, sans atteindre des situations moralement répréhensibles désavouant l’homme lui-même ? Entre la faute morale et une forme de bienfaisance thérapeutique, existe-t-il un juste milieu à travailler dans l’annonce d’une nouvelle qui intègrerait un regard et une réflexion sur la bonne temporalité, le kairos à saisir dans l’intuition d’une relation ?

Strategies to learn computationally efficient and compact dictionaries,"Dictionary learning is a branch of signal processing and machine learning that aims at expressing some given training data matrix as the multiplication of two factors: one dense matrix called dictionary and one sparse matrix being the representation of the data in the dictionary. The sparser the representation, the better the dictionary. However, manipulating the dictionary as a dense matrix can be computationally costly both in the learning process and later in the usage of this dictionary, thus limiting dictionary learning to relatively small-scale problems. In this paper we consider a general structure of dictionary allowing faster manipulation, and give an algorithm to learn such dictionaries over training data, as well as preliminary results showing the interest of our approach.","['info', 'spi']"

This paper describes a user-friendly authoring tool to create and synchronize such effects with audiovisual content. More precisely we focus on the edition of motion effects. Authoring is simplified thanks to a dedicated graphical user interface, allowing either to import external data or to synthesize effects thanks to a force-feedback device. Another key feature of this editor is the playback function which enables to preview the motion effect.

Six Blind Men and the Elephant: Benchmarking and Simulation in the Exascale Era,"As we leave the Petascale milestone behind us, the computing industry is changing rapidly to address the next challenges. Energy, dependability, cost pressure and economy of scale are pushing IT consolidation into large ""cloud"" datacenters where new workloads and legacy applications coexist. Data is growing at a higher exponential rate than computing, and novel data-centric architectures are starting to emerge. Heterogeneity and specialization, within and across instruction sets, are reemerging to address energy efficiency. In light of these secular shifts in the IT industry, the benchmarking and simulation techniques are lagging behind and need to deeply transform to address the upcoming challenges. Like the ancient Hindu parable, current practices in the architecture community suffer from an excessive focus on narrow metrics, none of which is either completely correct or totally wrong, but often risk missing the big picture. This talk will discuss how computer architecture simulation and benchmarking must evolve to provide better quality decision support data for datacenter-level computing. Speed, full-system, validation and modularity are some of the fundamental characteristics of a scalable simulator. Dynamically trading off speed and accuracy, running unmodified software, and the flexibility to interface with multiple tools are other key aspects that should drive the development of the next generation simulators. As a case study, the talk will cover some of the design considerations behind COTSon, an open-source scalable full-system simulation infrastructure targeting fast and accurate evaluation of current and future computing systems.",['info']

Challenges in Binary Translation for Desktop Supercomputing,"Given the fact that the microprocessor industry has jumped off the frequency scaling bandwagon due to power issues, the rate of development of aggressive many-core systems has picked up in the past few years. However, these many-core systems have taken a range of incarnations: graphics processors (GPUs) have emerged as the data-parallel architecture of choice; heterogeneous architectures (e.g., AMD Fusion and IBM Cell) have emerged, though present challenges to code developers and compiler writers; and general purpose CPUs continue to increase the number of cores based on Moore's Law, though they lack the data-parallel horsepower found on other architectural styles. These many-core systems come equipped with a range of programming languages, runtime environments, and compiler frameworks. In the case of GPUs, the architecture of the programmable shader core continues to evolve today in an effort to adapt these graphics-oriented processors to the requirements of the scientific computing community. For this reason, both AMD and NVIDIA have defined intermediate representations (IRs) as part of their offerings. The main role of any IR is to provide a stable instruction set architecture that spans multiple microarchitecture generations, similar to the concept of bytecodes in Java. In the case of AMD/ATI GPUs, the IR is called the Intermediate Language (IL), and for NVIDIA GPUs, the IR is called Parallel Thread Execution (PTX). Our work explores the fundamental differences between PTX and IL and the benefits of each IR. We are enhancing a binary translation framework to translate PTX into IL, allowing applications compiled for NVIDIA's C for CUDA environment targeting NVIDIA GPUs to run on AMD/ATI GPUs. We will report on our results to date, and will shed some light on the challenges that lay before us.",['info']

"Multi-domain Processors: Challenges, Design Methods, and Recent Developments","Multi-domain processors characterized by multiple clock/voltage and power domains are widely used to manage power in modern nano-scale processor designs, especially in large scale multi- or many-core systems that require aggressive power management methodologies. One such example is the 48-core prototype processor recently announced by Intel Corp. In order to understand the challenges and opportunities in this problem space, this tutorial presents a comprehensive overview of advanced design techniques in multi-domain clock and power management for high-performance processors, as well as low power systems-on-chip (SoCs). As the number of components on a single chip and their performance continue to increase, the design of the communication architecture plays a major role. From this perspective, this tutorial addresses the network-on-chip (NoC) design and presents several research issues where the concept of “network” is at the forefront of multi/many-core processing. NoCs are suitable for large high-performance chip multiprocessors as well as SoCs, all of which increasingly employing a multi- domain design style. Consequently, the tutorial surveys asynchronous routers for various architectures and asynchronous interconnections that enable higher bandwidth and lower power. The tutorial will discuss these issues and outline existing approaches to overcome any inherent deficiencies and fully enable the aforementioned technology. In addition to the on-chip communication problem, the twin concern of increased power consumption of future multi/many-core systems needs to be addressed, especially in the presence of workload and parameter variations. For multi-core designs, the concept of multiple voltage/frequency islands (VFIs) is typically used to enable fine-grain power management. In such a system, each island can work at its own speed, while the communication across different VFIs is achieved through mixed clock/mixed voltage FIFOs. We plan to discuss the design and management of novel NoC architectures partitioned into multiple VFIs, as well as online feedback control mechanisms that can dynamically adjust the operating voltage and frequency around some statically prescribed values. Finally, considering variability effects at micro-architecture and architecture levels is needed for determining variation-aware dynamic power management algorithms that are most likely to meet performance and power constraints. Towards this end, we plan to discuss modeling the effects of process variation at micro-architecture/architecture level in modern multi/many-core, multi-domain systems and show how dynamic power management mechanisms can be developed such that these systems behave in a robust manner in the presence of process technology parameter variation. Of extreme importance is the ability to provide workload- and process variability-driven adaptability not only through a static assignment of local voltages/frequencies, but also using dynamic application mapping and on-the-fly voltage/frequency scaling.",['info']

Indefinite Linear MPC and Approximated Economic MPC for Nonlinear Systems,"This talk presents some new results where it has been shown that any stabilizing indefinite LQR or MPC scheme can be reformulated as a positive definite one. First, the conditions for the existence of a stabilizing indefinite LQR are given. Then, two transformations under which the LQR is unchanged are introduced. By combining these two transformations, the problem is reformulated in a form for which it is easy to prove the existence of a positive definite equivalent formulation using Lyapunov arguments. The results are finally extended to the case of a finite horizon and a terminal cost different from the LQR cost-to-go. The talk concludes by proposing a tracking nonlinear MPC formulation that approximately solves economic nonlinear MPC. The derivation is based on the results for the linear quadratic indefinite case and therefore relies on a local stabilizability assumption. The interest of such an approximated scheme is twofold as a) it has the stability properties of tracking schemes and b) it allowes the deployment of efficient numerical methods.",['math']

We study the homogenization problem in these two different cases.

Intrusive unit testing for Web applications,"Several tools have been designed for automating tests on Web applications. They usually drive browsers the same way people do: they click links, fill in forms, press buttons, and they check results, such as whether an expected text appears on the page. WUnit is such a tool, but goes a step further: it can act inside the server, examine server-side components, and even modify them, which gives more controls to the tests to write. For example, in our tests we can get the user session server-side, store an arbitrary object (that does have sense in our test) in the user session, and get the page that renders it. Cheating like this allows to bypass the normal functioning of a Web application and really perform independent unit tests, which gives more flexibility to test-driven development. In this session, we'll present the Active Tags framework from which is derived WUnit, and experiment how to design simply a test suite for an AJAX-based application: how to get a page, fill a form, upload files, and of course how to act on server-sides components.",['info']

Market Share Game with adversarial Access providers : A Neutral and a Non-neutral Network Analysis,"Internet pricing schemes have not been concerned in the network-neutrality research. In this paper, we study the implication of non-neutrality on the competition between Internet Access Providers. We interpret non-neutral network when a service provider privileges a Content Provider (CP) in order to propose a high quality of service for this content like time-sensitive applications (voice over Internet protocol, live video streaming, online gaming). We present a competitive model that describes the interaction between several competing telecommunications Access Providers (APs), their subscribers, and a network owner. Competition between the access providers is assumed to take place in their pricing decisions as well as in terms of the Quality of Service (QoS) they offer. Furthermore, our work focuses on the analysis of games between APs under two cases : case of neutral network and case of non-neutral network. After having discussed the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium, we analyzed the impact of non-neutrality versus neutrality. In particular, we showed that non-neutrality has a significant effect on the charged tariffs and the perceived quality of services in case where exist restrictions on the available bandwidth at the AP-CP link.",['info']
The Interplay Between Caching and Popularity,"The increased availability of meta-data in Web 2.0 (as opposed to traditional Web) can and should be exploited to make such techniques more effective. Caching should improve the performance and scalability of multimedia service streaming (e.g., YouTube). In this contribution, we introduce new directions and considerations in the analysis of caching popular content in the Web which allows us to gain insight on deriving more informative indications for quality of service development. We provide a dynamic model for the impact of popularity on the access speed due to caching policies of a service provider. More specifically, we assume that caches are spatially deployed as a Poisson distribution and that users are distributed over the geographical area in a Poissonian manner. Our model is formulated as epidemic type process of file dissemination. We then study the transient behavior of caches where information is replicated and disseminated according to an epidemic type dynamics based on the popularity of the content. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides significant improvement in terms of the system throughput.",['info']
Revisiting Collusion in Routing Games: a Load Balancing Problem,"Is it profitable for players to unite and merge to a single player? Obviously, the sum of utilities at an equilibrium cannot exceed the sum obtained if all players join together. But what happens if only a subset of players join together? Previous work on collusion have already shown that the society may either gain or loose from collusion of a subset of players. In this paper we show for a simple load balancing example that not only the society may loose, but also the subset of players that collude may end up with a worse performance than without collusion. In doing so, we introduce new concepts that measure the price of collusion.",['info']
Incentive Mechanism for Prompting ISPs to Implement Outbound Filtering of Unwanted Traffic,"Methods of filtering unwanted traffic in ISPs are categorized into inbound filtering at receiver ISPs and outbound filtering at sender ISPs. Outbound filtering is effective because it can directly utilize sender information such as dynamic IP address information, but not widely used in the current Internet. This is because outbound filtering does not benefit the ISP that installs it and pays the cost, but benefits ISPs that receive unwanted traffic from the installing ISP. The objective of our study is to solve this incentive problem.We propose an incentive mechanism where ISPs pay penalties for sending unwanted traffic to peering ISPs. This payment is combined with payments of transit fees so that the mechanism will be deployed through the current ISP relationship. The key question here is whether the mechanism will be deployed or not, and we confirmed through simulations that the mechanism is spontaneously adopted by a sufficient number of ISPs who behave in a selfish manner. Accordingly, outbound filtering was also widely installed. In our simulation scenario, there are some ISPs who send little unwanted traffic and should not install the outbound filtering due to its cost. Our simulation showed that with an appropriate penalty charge parameter setting, our proposed mechanism can achieve the state that almost all ISPs who should install the outbound filtering install the filtering, and otherwise not.",['info']

The Cloud is the future Internet: how can we engineer a cloud?,"The future Internet will be a network of data centers. Of course, this is already true today in the sense that most content and services delivered to end users come from a data center of some form or other. We postulate a future where this cloud of compute and storage resources is rationalized to yield a much more economically efficient structure. Users will be attached to the Internet via a data center that, among other functions, will act as router for the small proportion of demand that cannot be handled locally. Independently of this prediction, the performance of data center networks and the cloud is among the hottest topics in networking today. More specifically, researchers are seeking ways to fulfill service level agreements, typically expressed in terms of minimum bandwidth and maximum latency guarantees, in the multi-tenanted cloud infrastructure. This is clearly reminiscent of the huge amount of effort expended over the last decades on trying to solve the issues of Internet QoS. Unfortunately, it seems lessons from the failure of much of that research have still not been widely learnt. We would argue that the main reason for the inapplicability of QoS service models is the failure to take proper account of the random nature of demand. While modelling demand in terms of stationary stochastic processes is a tried and tested approach in engineering many networks and systems, it is hardly ever applied in evaluating schemes for sharing Internet (or cloud) resources. This is unfortunate since, in our experience, it is an approach that brings essential understanding and enables the design of simple and effective traffic control mechanisms. We must gain similar understanding to engineer the cloud. The challenge is to succinctly characterize cloud traffic and then to elaborate models to accurately predict performance for given demand and network capacity.",['info']
Discontinuous Galerkin method for Hamilton-Jacobi equations and front propagation with obstacles,"In this talk we will first describe a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations, including those for front propagation problems. This method solves the Hamilton-Jacobi equations directly, with out first converting them to conservation law systems, can be proved to converge optimally in L^2 for smooth solutions, and perform nicely for viscosity solutions with singularities. We then extend the DG method to front propagation problems in the presence of obstacles. We follow the formulation of Bokanowski et al. leading to a level set formulation driven by min(u_t +H(x,∇u), u−g(x)) = 0, where g(x) is an obstacle function. The DG scheme is motivated by the variational formulation when the Hamiltonian H is a linear function of ∇u, corresponding to linear convection problems in presence of obstacles. The scheme is then generalized to nonlinear equations, resulting in an explicit form which is very efficient in implementation. Stability analysis are performed for the linear case with Euler forward, a second and third order SSP Runge-Kutta time discretization, and convergence is proved for the linear case with Lipschitz continuous and piecewise smooth data. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the robustness of the method. Finally, a narrow band approach is considered in order to reduce the computational cost. This is a joint work with Yingda Cheng (the design of the scheme), Tao Xiong (error estimates for smooth solutions), and Olivier Bokanowski and Yingda Cheng (front propagation without and with obstacles).",['math']
Transport equation with source and generalized Wasserstein distance,"We will start by revising some macroscopic model, based on systems of conservation (or balance) laws, for network flows, such as road networks, supply chains, gas pipelines etc.. Such models were successfully employed in traffic monitoring projects. Then we will pass to measure solutions to nonlinear transport equations, which naturally allow multi-scale approaches. In particular we can integrate micro and macro scales in a unique representation. We show how the Wasserstein metric is the natural one in this context and how to generalize it to deal with source terms. Finally, we show some examples of simulations for crowd dynamics and vehicular traffic.",['math']
Bang bang trajectories with a double switching time in the minimum time problem,"We consider the minimum time problem with xed end-points on a finite dimensional manifold M in the case when the dynamics is a ne with respect to the control and the control set is a box in R^m. We are interested in giving sufficient conditions for strong local optimality. Our sufficient conditions are given using Hamiltonian methods, but here the presence of a double switch makes the proof of the local invertibility of the maximized Hamiltonian flow much more tricky.",['math']
Necessary Conditions in Dynamic Optimization,"Necessary conditions of optimality are a centrepiece of optimal control theory. Even in situations in which they do not lead directly to the solution of a particular problem, they have an important role both in establishing regularity properties of minimizers and inspiring numerical solution techniques. In this talk, we cover the evolution of this field following on from the discovery of the Maximum Principle 50 years ago, recent developments and current open questions. Special emphasis is given to an approaches according to which dynamic optimization problems are formulated as generalized problems in the calculus of variations with one independent variable and then far reaching extensions of classical necessary conditions are derived by means of non-smooth analysis.",['math']

On the Optimization of Riemann-Stieltjes-Control-Systems with Application in Vehicle Dynamics,"Optimizing discontinuous systems is a eld of research with many unsolved problems. In this work, we focus on a method to model dynamic multibody control systems subject to state dependent frictional impacts using Riemann- Stieltjes-Integrals. As the impulsive character of the system is based on the state only, the controls exclusively enter the continuous Riemannian part of the dynamics. The system equations are combined with a set of impact conditions, wich are introduced to calculate the jumps of generalized veloci- ties at contact using a formulation with energetically consistent generalized coe cients-of-restitution. These impact conditions are a reformulation of a complementarity problem with additional constraints on the post-impact ve- locities. Based on this model of di erential equations with state disconti- nuities, a gradient based optimization routine is presented making use of the bounded variation assumption in the velocity components. The veloc- ity jumps are computed by evaluatingthe frictional model as a minor op- timization problem for the coe cients-of-restitution in tangential direction. The theoretical method has shown to be applicable for di erent optimization problems with continuous state dependent cost functionals. The method is il- lustrated in a numerical example, where comfort and handling characteristics for vehicle models are optimized due to road irregularities. Last, we draw a comparison between results derived by this method and a commercial library for tyre-road interaction forces.",['math']

Continuous and piecewise affine Lyapunov functions using the Yoshizawa construction,"We present a novel numerical technique for the computation of a Lyapunov function for nonlinear systems with an asymptotically stable equilibrium point. Our proposed approach constructs a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) function given a suitable partition of the state space, called a triangulation, and values at the vertices of the triangulation. The vertex values are obtained from a Lyapunov function in a classical converse Lyapunov theorem and verification that the obtained CPA function is a Lyapunov function is shown to be equivalent to verification of several simple inequalities. Furthermore, by refining the triangulation, we show that it is always possible to construct a CPA Lyapunov function. Numerical examples are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",['math']
Reconstruction of Independent sub-domains in a Hamilton-Jacobi Equation and its Use for Parallel Computation,"A previous knowledge of the domains of dependence of a dynamic programming equation can be useful in its study and approximation. Information on the nature are, in general, difficult to obtain directly from the dynamics of the problem. In this paper we introduce formally the concept of Independent Sub-Domains discussing their main properties and we provide a constructive implicit representation formula. Using these results an original approach to independent domain reconstruction is presented and its usefulness in the parallel approximation of the solution is discussed.",['math']
Parametric sensitivity analysis and real-time optimal control using TransWORHP,"Algorithms for the numerical solution of discretized optimal control problems are already used successfully in many areas of application, e.g. robotics, aerospace engineering, chemistry, or automotive industry. However, to improve the industrial applicability in case of perturbations, strategies for realtime solutions are necessary. For an optimal solution, the recent module WORHP Zen provides parametric sensitivity differentials. These values describe how the unperturbed optimal solution would change if the vector of parameter is modified slightly. We will discuss methods, how these off-line values can also be used for a fast on-line approximation of the perturbed solution. The cost-efficiency and robustness of these iterative methods will be illustrated by applied examples using tools available in TransWORHP.",['math']

Policy iteration for stochastic zero-sum games,"Recent results of Ye and Hansen, Miltersen and Zwick show that policy iteration for one or two player (perfect information) zero-sum stochastic games, restricted to instances with a fixed discount rate, is strongly polynomial. We show that policy iteration for mean-payoff zero-sum stochastic games is also strongly polynomial when restricted to instances with bounded first mean return time to a given state. The proof is based on methods of nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, allowing us to reduce the mean-payoff problem to a discounted problem with state dependent discount rate. Our analysis also shows that policy iteration remains strongly polynomial for discounted problems in which the discount rate can be state dependent (and even negative) at certain states, provided that the spectral radii of the nonnegative matrices associated to all strategies are bounded from above by a fixed constant strictly less than 1.",['math']
(Un)conditional consensus emergence under perturbed and decentralized feedback controls,"We study the problem of consensus emergence in multiagent systems via feedback control.

Sufficient Conditions for Strong Local Optimality with Applications to Biomedical Problems,"We consider optimal control problems over a fixed interval for multi-input bilinear dynamical systems with both $L_1$ and $L_2$-type objectives in the presence of control constraints. Problems of this type arise as mathematical models for cancer chemotherapy over an a priori specified fixed therapy horizon. The extremals resulting from an application of the Pontryagin maximum principle are analyzed. Conditions are given that allow to embed extremals into a field of broken extremals leading to easily verifiable sufficient conditions for strong local optimality. In the case of an $L_1$-type objective, flows of extremal bang-bang trajectories arise for which a simple algorithmic procedure to verify local optimality will be formulated. In the case of an $L_2$-type objective, sufficient conditions for strong local optimality that are based on the existence of a bounded solution to a matrix Riccati differential equation will be formulated. The theory is illustrated with a $3$-compartment model for multi-drug cancer chemotherapy with cytotoxic and cytostatic agents.",['math']

Decoding Complex Cardiac Arrhythmia using Mathematical Optimization,"It is an open clinical problem to distinguish atrial flutter from atrial fibrillation. The discrimination is imperative, as atrial fibrillation is the most frequent arrhythmia in the adult (about 6 million individuals across Europe) and both types have to be treated differently in the interest of the patient. Atrial flutter is underrecognized in clinical practice. Especially in cases of irregular ventricular response it is often misinterpreted as atrial fibrillation. Caused by an increasing number of left atrial catheter ablations (pulmonary vein isolations), the number of left atrial flutter is increasing at an alarming rate, making the mentioned decoding task an ubiquitous one. We discuss different possible mathematical approaches to the discrimination problem and present a phenomenological modeling approach that leads to a challenging optimization problem. For the resulting non-standard mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems we present tailored solution strategies and very encouraging results from a transfer to clinical practice.",['math']

WORLD ORDER TRANSFORMATION AND SOCIOPOLITICAL DESTABILIZATION BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM WORKING PAPERS SERIES: INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,"The present working paper analyzes the world order in the past, present and future as well as the main factors, foundations and ideas underlying the maintaining and change of the international and global order. The first two sections investigate the evolution of the world order starting from the ancient times up to the late twentieth century. The third section analyzes the origin and decline of the world order based on the American hegemony. The authors reveal contradictions of the current unipolar world and explain in what way globalization has become more profitable for the developing countries but not for the developed ones. The paper also explains the strengthening belief that the US leading status will inevitably weaken. In this connection we discuss the alternatives of the American strategy and the possibility of the renaissance of the American leadership. The last section presents a factor analysis which allows stating that the world is shifting toward a new balance of power and is likely to become the world without a leader. The new world order will consist of a number of large blocks, coalitions and countries acting within a framework of rules and mutual responsibility. However, the transition to a new world order will take certain time (about two decades). This period, which we denote as the epoch of new coalitions, will involve a reconfiguration of the World-System and bring an increasing turbulence and conflict intensity. There are grounds to conclude that in 2011–2012 the World-System experienced to some extent a phase transition to a qualitatively new state of global protest activity. This phase transition is shown to bear some resemblance to the one which the World-System experienced in the early 1960s. The first (after 1919) phase transition of this sort occurred in the early 1960s and was related to the growth of global informational connectivity after the World War II, as well as the improvement of the means of protest self-organization due to the spread of television, portable radio receivers, portable electric loud-speakers and other technologies of the Fourth Kondratieff Cycle. The phase transition of the early 2010s was prepared by a new wave of growth of global informational connectivity, as well as the improvement of the means of protest self-organization due to the spread of various technologies of the Fifth Kondratieff cycle (the Internet, satellite television, Twitter and other social networks, mobile telephony etc.). Similarly to what was observed during the Fourth Kondratieff Wave, during the Fifth Cycle while the spread of these technologies was going on for many years before 2011, their internal colossal potential for generating and spreading protest activity was realized in one leap, as a phase transition.",['shs']
Effect of kinetic facades on energy efficiency in office buildings -hot dry climatesEffet des façades cinétiques sur l'efficacité énergétique dans les immeubles de bureaux - Climat chaud et aride,"In hot dry climates excess solar gain may result in high cooling energy consumption and indoor discomfort; sun control and shading devices is an important aspect of many energy-efficient building design strategies. Advanced CAD systems that integrate computational tools, such as parametric design systems, make possible and explore ways to formulate a responsive building envelope that could interact with sun position. The parametric design provides innovative building envelopes, which are more adaptive and interactive by actively responding to prevailing weather conditions, for enhancing energy performance and indoor thermal comfort levels. This study attempts to examine and evaluate the effect and performance of smart façades in the context of the indoor thermal comfort and energy efficiency. These parameters are achieved by controlling the levels of solar radiation and by calculating shading element sizes for sun control in response to environmental changes. In order to ensure the systems autonomy the semi-transparent PV modules has been used as panel's material. The method is applied to the case study of a reference office building with a fixed glazed façade windows-to-wall ratio in hot arid climate zone of Algeria, in particular the city of Biskra (latitude 34.6N). The results obtained from modeling simulation, using GECO-grasshopper (parametric plug-in for Rhinoceros), shown That kinetic facades equipped with PV modules have greatly influenced in a positive way the indoor air temperature, thermal and visual comfort levels and also, work towards a better environment for the inhabitants instead of simply being the part that separates the interior from the exterior.","['sde', 'spi', 'shs']"

Certifying smallholder producers: linking specific challenges to general trends,"This session will showcase lessons learned from the experiences of small-scale producers in meeting the requirements for participation in certified supply chains. We draw upon two FAO activities to provide the specificity of a case study and the generality of these problems within broader trends found through empirical studies. We use a case study from a project in Guatemala that partnered with private and public organizations to certify small-scale producers for GlobalGAP standards in the horticulture sector targeting high-value markets. We use a literature review of empirical studies and project reports to situate this case study within broader trends. An ‘impacts pathway’ was developed to understand how antecedent variables at farm, value chain, standard system and institutional levels impact the profitability and ways in which farmers participate in certified supply chains. During this session we will discuss the role of partnerships in preparing smallholder farmers for certification, the challenges encountered during the implementation and certification of GAP, and the practical ways found to link small-scale producers to certified supply chains for both domestic and export markets.",['sdv']

The implementation of well-known western corporate governance mechanisms in emerging markets, which mostly focus on unsophisticated financial services, is likely to act more as operating constraints than value-creation factors. Based on a sample drawn from 98 commercial banks over the period 2006–2010, we document the following three main findings: (1) dual structure and board size are significantly negatively associated with banks' performance as proxied by Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), (2) dual structure and board diversity exhibit a significant negative relation with banks' liquidity risk, (3) the presence of chief executive officer (CEO) in the board of directors appears to be the only corporate governance mechanism efficiently associated with banks' liquidity risk.",['shs']
"History of mathematical education in ancient, medieval and pre modern India (within the Chapter: Mathematics Education in Oriental Antiquity and Middle Ages)","Very little is known of the context in which much of ancient India's scholarly knowledge burgeoned.

In the following three historical periods relevant to the history of mathematics in India are studied. The Vedic period (ca. 2500 BCE-500 BCE), Classical and Medieval period (-500 BCE-XIIth century), and Premodern period (XIIIth-XVIIIth century), in which oral transmissions and written practices, texts of elementary, vocational or specialised mathematics are examined for what they may reveal of an educational setting.",['shs']
Concepts for interventional MRI and computer assisted surgery in congenital heart diseases,"An integrated approach to assess ventricular pump function, diastolic compliance, myocontractility and vascular function would be of high clinical value. To date, MRI is considered the gold standard for quantifying ventricular volumes and blood flow and recent advances in fast imaging techniques made MRI catheterization a reality. The combination of invasive pressures with MRI derived volumes was demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the endsystolic pressure-volume relationship, which is considered the optimal quantification of systolic ventricular function. In addition, MRI catheterization was shown to provide accurate vascular resistance measurements.

"Scientific opinion on flavouring group evaluation 49, revision 1 (FGE.49Rev1): Xanthine alkaloids from the priority list","Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) was requested to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety assessment of the flavouring substances caffeine [FL-no: 16.016] and theobromine [FL-no: 16.032] in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 49, Revision 1. Consequent to the 2015 scientific opinion from the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on the safety of caffeine from all dietary sources, the CEF Panel considered it inappropriate to evaluate the two substances through the Procedure. For caffeine, the Panel based its assessment on the safety threshold of 5.7 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for adults, except pregnant/lactating women, and 3 mg/kg bw per day for children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, as established by the NDA Panel. The safety evaluation of theobromine takes into account that approximately 11% of an oral dose of caffeine is metabolised to theobromine and that both substances have a similar pharmacological profile. For the exposure assessment, a brand loyalty model was chosen. In this model, it was assumed that a consumer is exposed on a long-term basis to a specific category of food (i.e. non-alcoholic beverages), containing caffeine or theobromine at their respective maximum use levels. For the rest of the categories, normal use levels applied. Daily dietary exposure to caffeine and theobromine (excluding systemic exposure) added as a chemically defined flavouring substance ranged 0-2.3 and 0-0.4 mg/kg bw, respectively, across all population groups. The Panel concluded that caffeine [FL-no: 16.016] and theobromine [FL-no: 16.032] would not be expected to present safety concern based on their estimated levels of intake from their use as flavouring substances.",['sdv']

"Safety assessment of the mixture of methyl‐branched and linear C14–C18 alkanamides, derived from fatty acids, for use in food contact materials","This scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of the mixture of methyl-branched and linear C-14-C-18 alkanamides, derived from fatty acids, for use in food contact materials as a slip or release agent at up to 1% w/w in polyolefins. The final materials are intended for contact with foodstuffs other than fatty foods for long-term storage at room temperature including short heating. No thermal degradation of the substance is expected under manufacturing process conditions of polyolefins. Specific migration from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) made with 0.37% of the substance into 3% acetic acid and 10% ethanol was up to 0.68 mg/kg. Based on negative results in a bacterial mutation test and in an in vivo micronucleus test, there was no evidence of a genotoxic potential of the substance. Impurities were determined and the main ones were tested in a bacterial mutation test giving negative results. Along with the negative results from the in vivo micronucleus test on the substance containing the impurities, there was no evidence of a genotoxic potential of the impurities. Based on a 28-day study on the substance, the Panel noted that there is sufficient margin of safety between the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and the maximum exposure of consumers that could occur at a migration level of 5 mg/kg food, to cover uncertainties about toxic effects due to potential accumulation of slowly hydrolysed branched amide species of the substance during chronic exposure. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance is not of safety concern for consumers if it is used in the manufacture of polyolefin articles intended for contact with all foodstuffs other than fatty foods and the migration does not exceed 5 mg/kg food. The 5 mg/kg food migration should not apply to n-stearamide.",['sdv']

Educational campaigns in favour of relaxed visual standards and acceptance of varietal diversity on the shelf would create favourable conditions for the marketing of IPM-produced food. 2. Supermarket procurement strategies can contribute to reducing risks. They could go a long way towards achieving reduced reliance on pesticides and advanced forms of IPM if they were to include relaxed visual standards and acceptance of resistant varieties. 3. Genuine partnerships between farmers, buyers and suppliers based on a common interest in reducing dependence on pesticides are needed. Such partnerships would result in broad and sustained support for IPM from farmers, but would entail rewarding farmers for their efforts and ensuring their access to the advisory and monitoring support which is required for IPM.",['sdv']

The present consideration concerns a group of 29 aliphatic secondary alcohols, ketones and related esters evaluated by JECFA at the 59th and 69th meetings in 2002 and 2008. This revision is made due to the inclusion of nine additional substances cleared for genotoxicity concern in FGE.205 Revision 1. The substances were evaluated through a stepwise approach that integrates information on structure-activity relationships, intake from current uses, toxicological threshold of concern and available data on metabolism and toxicity. The Panel agrees with the application of the Procedure as performed by JECFA for all 29 substances considered in this FGE. For all substances, the Panel concludes that there is 'no safety concern at the estimated levels of intake as flavouring substances based on the MSDI approach'. For all 29 substances, the specifications for the materials of commerce have also been considered and found adequate. Ten out of the 14 substances for which use levels became available exceed the modified theoretical added maximum daily intake (mTAMDI) and more reliable exposure data are required to finalise their evaluation. On the basis of such data, additional toxicological data might become necessary. For 15 substances, use levels are needed to calculate the mTAMDIs in order to identify those flavouring substances that need more refined exposure assessment to finalise the evaluation.",['sdv']
Voluntary Standards: Impacting Smallholders’ Market Participation,"Voluntary standards are rules, guidelines or characteristics about a product or a process. They are not mandatory regulations, but are used voluntarily by producers, processors, retailers and consumers. These voluntary standards are usually developed by private sector actors (e.g. firms or consortiums), representatives of civil society, or public sector agencies. Voluntary standards are part of a growing trend in global markets. As a result, FAO and member countries are being asked to respond adequately to the opportunities and challenges presented by business models that could foster both increased food security and better market access for small-scale producers. FAO reviewed the current evidence of the impact of voluntary standards on smallholders’ ability to participate in markets and found that it is limited mainly to three standards: GLOBALG.A.P., fairtrade and organic. Moreover, most studies focus on coffee and horticulture products, and cover only a handful of countries: Costa Rica, Kenya, Mexico, Peru and Uganda.",['sdv']

Encouraging investment in agro-industries through commercial extension: the case of the Tea Research Institute of Tanzania,"Liberalisation policy in the 1980s marks the beginning of the promotion of investment in agro-industries in Tanzania. The Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (2001) proposes that the government work towards creating an enabling environment for medium and large-scale investors to make use of its abundant land resources. The Tanzania Investment Act of 1997, allows non-citizens to own land for the purpose of investment, also through joint ventures with Tanzanians. The recent initiative, which embraces public-private partnerships - Kilimo Kwanza (Agriculture First, 2009) - promotes investment in food crops while “maintaining good practices for investment in traditional cash crops.” Tea is one of only two traditional export crops that have doubled productivity since the 1970s, it has survived recent drops in global commodity prices, and its world market price has risen during the current economic crisis. Together with the Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperatives and Food Security, private sector organizations actively promote investment; including the Tanzania National Business Council (2001), the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (1998), the National Economic Empowerment Council (2005), and the Agricultural Council of Tanzania (2000). Within the tea sub-sector, private-sector organizations (i.e., Tea Research Institute of Tanzania (TRIT, 1996), Tea Association of Tanzania (1943)) are represented on the Tea Board of Tanzania which is the regulatory body of the government (1997). These actors work together to promote productive investment in the sub-sector. Successful investment has rehabilitated the tea sub-sector. Aspects of the original privatization legislation promoted investment in the industry (e.g., the Tea Act of 1997 requires local processing of green-leaf tea). These commitments have led to a processing sector that produces for international and domestic markets. Starting in 2001, TRIT launched a commercial extension service for the sub-sector. This arrangement, whereby a private company (Wakulima Tea Company) approaches a research institute to provide services at cost, is a unique setup, linking researchers, extension services, farmers, transporters, processors and markets. Subsequently, additional investment is forthcoming in the tea sector. For example, a MOU was signed in 2009 with tea stakeholders and two private-sector donor foundations. Over the next five years US$ 9 million will be invested through a variety of mechanisms including matching grants, loan guarantees, and debt/equity investments. The example of the Tanzanian tea sub-sector illustrates how the strategy of linking commercial extension with public-private funded research has aided investment in the entire industry. The case shows promise for public-private partnerships in promoting productive investment in agro-industries. Challenges remain where some factories limit their investment in catchment areas, which hinders smallholder development.",['sdv']
Implementing IPM - A gradual path involving many stakeholders - Policy Brief No. 1,"Main findings: 1. The path of an individual farmer along the IPM continuum is a gradual process and ranges over a number of years. This process involves changing the way in which farmers and their neighbours assess their work. 2. Lasting collective dynamics involving farmers, advisers and researchers are key to the emergence of robust and far-reaching transitions. Policies designed to promote IPM should include support to farmer and farmer-advisor groups.",['sdv']
Autonomous Agents for Self-managed MPLS DiffServ-TE Domain,"The combination between DiffServ (Differentiated Services) and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) presents a very attractive strategy to backbone network service providers. It provides scalable QoS and traffic engineering capabilities. However, the management of such a network is not a simple function and could not be done manually. In fact, it would be much more economic and effective to automatically manage networks. In this paper, we discuss the essential characteristics needed to build an autonomic network. We also propose a novel architecture based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in order to automatically manage an MPLS-DiffServ TE domain. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of our proposition.",['info']
A Memetic Algorithm with Population Management (MA|PM) for the Periodic Location-Routing Problem,"A generalization of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has been developed toward tactical or strategic decision levels of companies but not both. The tactical extension or Periodic VRP (PVRP) plans a set of trips over a multiperiod horizon, subject to frequency constraints. The strategic extension is motivated by interdependent depot location and routing decisions in most distribution systems. Low-quality solutions are obtained if depots are located first, regardless the future routes. In the Location-Routing Problem (LRP), location and routing decisions are simultaneously tackled. The goal here is to combine the PVRP and LRP into an even more realistic problem covering all decision levels: the Periodic LRP or PLRP. An evolutionary algorithm called Memetic Algorithm with Population Management (MA|PM) is proposed to solve large size instances of the PLRP. First, a population is randomly generated. Every individual represents a feasible solution using the same combination of visit days on each customers. The evolution is operated by a memetic mechanism and the offsprings must satisfy a distance test before entering the population. Information about better customer assignment to visit days is collected on the offsprings, and is used to create a new population of solutions. The algorithm stops when a given number of regenerations of the population is reached. The method is evaluated on three sets of instances and solutions are compared to the literature on particular cases such as one-day horizons (LRP) or one depot (PVRP). This metaheuristic outperforms the previous method for the PLRP.",['info']
Utilization of a Cooperative Multiagent System in the Context of Cognitive Radio Networks,In this paper we propose an approach to solve the spectrum allocation/sharing problem using Multiagent System (MAS) cooperation that enables Cognitive Radio (CR) devices to share the unutilized spectrum dynamically and opportunistically. We introduce briefly the problem of static spectrum assignment and propose an approach to solve this issue. The key aspect of our design is the deployment of agents on each of the CR and Primary User (PU) devices that cooperate in order to have a better use of the spectrum. An example scenario is also presented along with our proposed model.,['info']
Thermal-oxidation of epoxy/amine followed by glass transition temperature changes,"Thermal oxidation of three epoxy resins differing by the nature of prepolymer (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether) and hardener (isophorone diamine and 4,7,10-Trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine) was studied by monitoring changes in glass transition temperature using DSC. Results were discussed using the DiMarzio's approach in which parameters are estimated from an additive group contribution. This theory allowed a fair assessment of Tg values for unaged networks. During oxidation, epoxy networks were shown to undergo chain scissions occurring in great part in hydroxypropyl ether and isophorone groups. However, the exploitation of Tg changes showed the coexistence and even the predominance of crosslinking in materials having linear aliphatic segments. The DiMarzio's approach was used to discuss the possibility of intramolecular cyclization or intermolecular crosslinks which were shown to predominate. Crosslinks were tentatively justified from a mechanistic point of view and quantified depending on experimental conditions.","['chim', 'spi']"
Multi-scale and multi-technical analysis of the thermal degradation of poly(ether imide),"The thermal degradation of PEI has been studied in wide ranges of temperature (between 180 and 250 °C) and oxygen partial pressure (between 0.21 and 50 bars). On one hand, the chemical ageing mechanisms have been analysed and elucidated by FTIR spectrophotometry and by differential calorimetry (DSC) on sufficiently thin PEI films (between 10 and 60 μm thickness) to be totally free of the effects of oxygen diffusion. As expected, and by analogy with other aromatic polymers of similar chemical structure, oxidation occurs preferentially on the methyl groups of the isopropylidene unit of the bisphenol A part, thus causing the disappearance of their characteristic IR absorption band at 2970 cm−1 and the growth of a new IR absorption band at 3350 cm−1, attributed to alcohols. In addition, oxidation leads successively to a relative predominance of chain scissions and crosslinking, resulting in a non-monotonic change of Tg. On the other hand, the consequences of oxidation on the elastic properties have been analysed and elucidated by micro-indentation on polished cross-sections of PEI plates of 3 mm thickness. The diffusion control of oxidation leads to the development of profiles of Young's modulus within the sample thickness, which correlate perfectly with the changes in chemical structure determined by FTIR spectrophotometry. However, the increase in Young's modulus in the superficial oxidized layer is not the direct consequence of oxidation but of a physical ageing.","['chim', 'spi']"
Hysteresis in the relation between moisture uptake and electrical conductivity in neat epoxy,"Monitoring changes in electrical conductivity is a simple way to assess the water uptake from environmental moisture in polymers. However, the relation between water uptake and changes in conductivity is not fully understood. We monitored changes in the electrical volume conductivity of an anhydride-cured epoxy polymer during moisture sorption-desorption experiments. Gravimetric analysis showed that the polymer exhibits a two-stage sorption behavior resulting from the competition between diffusive and reactive mechanisms. As expected, the macroscopic electrical conductivity increases with the diffusion of water. However, our most surprising observation was severe hysteresis in the relation between water uptake and electrical conductivity during the sorption and desorption experiments. This indicates that change in the electrical conductivity depends on both the water uptake and the competition between the diffusive and reactive mechanisms. We studied samples with various thicknesses to determine the relative effects of the diffusive and reactive mechanisms. This is an important observation as it means that general electrical monitoring techniques should be used cautiously when it comes to measuring the moisture content of polymer or polymer-based composite samples.",['chim']
Thermal oxidation of epoxies: Influence of diamine hardener,This work reports the thermal oxidation of DGEBA resins totally cured with cycloaliphatic (isophorone diamine) or with linear aliphatic (trioxa-tridecanediamine or TTDA) diamine hardener. Chemical changes (carbonyl build-up) were monitored by FTIR and macromolecular changes (chains scission and crosslinking) from Tg variations measured by DSC. Exposition at several temperatures and under several oxygen pressures showed that DGEBA/IPDA has systematically the highest oxidation rate. It was also observed that DGEBA/IPDA undergoes mainly chain scissions whereas DGEBA/TTDA undergoes a predominant crosslinking under air being partially suppressed under enhanced oxygen pressure. Results were discussed on the basis of the possible influence of the structure of hardener.,"['chim', 'spi']"
Water ageing of urethane dimethacrylate networks,"This work explores the process of water ageing of high-temperature high-pressure polymerized urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) networks. UDMA samples polymerized under several pressures (0.1–300 MPa) and differing by the conversion degree of polymerization were aged in water at 37, 50 and 70 °C and followed by gravimetry. Diffusion was observed to obey Fick's law. The diffusion coefficient and water maximal uptake were observed to be almost independent of polymerization pressure, consistently with analysis of Dynamic Vapor Sorption data suggesting that external polymerization pressure has no effect on polymer affinity with water. This was ascribed to the fact that all materials have the same cohesive energy, as confirmed by ultrasonic measurements of elastic moduli. Polymerization pressure (used to improve conversion degree and mechanical properties) would thus have a minor influence on water ageing that is mainly triggered by polymer chemistry. When elevating the polymerization pressure, there is hence no compromise between the optimization of thermo-mechanical properties and the resistance to water ageing.","['chim', 'spi']"
Polyethylene loss of ductility during oxidation: Effect of initial molar mass distribution,"This paper reports a study of thermal oxidation induced embrittlement in several polyethylene grades differing mainly by the broadness of the molar mass distribution (ranging for lower than 3 to more than 30). Thermal oxidation was monitored at macromolecular scale (Gel Permeation Chromatography, Differential Scanning Calorimetry) and macroscopic scale (tensile tests). As expected, the samples undergo predominant chain scission and plastic deformation is suppressed below a critical molar mass value (M’C). Even though this latter was previously reported to be independent of the initial weight average molar mass, it is shown here that it depends on initial polydispersity index. Samples were also shown to undergo chemicrystallization, i.e. that segments released by chain scissions migrate into the crystalline phase with a yield increasing with initial polydispersity index. Finally, the main novelty of this work is to evidence that the previously proposed end-of-life criteria at macromolecular level linked to loss of ductility (critical molar mass, crystallization yield) depend on the initial polydispersity index.","['chim', 'spi']"
Effect of thermal oxidation on the self-assembly of triblock terpolymers,"This paper reports an investigation of the thermal degradation of a poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-methyl methacrylate) triblock terpolymer compared with those of butadiene rubbers and poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate). According to sol-gel properties changes, it was proposed that polybutadiene blocks undergo mainly crosslinking. However, these latter coexist with chain scissions occurring in polybutadiene blocks, which generates poly(butadiene-b-methyl methacrylate) and poly(butadiene-b-styrene) diblock chains, and possibly chain scissions occurring in polystyrene and poly(methyl methacylate) blocks. The consequences of the degradation on the self-assembly of triblock terpolymer were studied through the annealing kinetics monitored by Atomic Force Microscopy. It appears that at low conversion degrees, chain scissions induce a faster self-assembly kinetics. At higher oxidation degrees, crosslinking of butadiene phase combined with scissions induces a “frozen” state at high annealing times characterized by a macrophase separation.","['chim', 'spi']"
Multi-scale and multi-technique analysis of the thermal degradation of poly(ether ether ketone),"The thermal degradation of PEEK has been studied in rubbery state in wide ranges of temperature (between 180 and 320 °C) and oxygen partial pressure (between 0.21 and 50 bars). On one hand, the thermal ageing mechanisms have been analysed and elucidated by FTIR spectrophotometry and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on sufficiently thin PEEK films (between 10 and 60 μm thickness) to be totally free of the effects of oxygen diffusion. Oxidation occurs on aromatic rings causing the growth of five new IR absorption bands centered at 3650, 3525, 1780, 1740 et 1718 cm−1 and attributed to the stretching vibrations of the O-H bonds of phenol and benzoïc acid, and the C-O bonds of benzoïc anhydride, phenyl benzoate and fluorenone respectively. In addition, oxidation leads to a large predominance of crosslinking over chain scissions resulting in a sharp increase of Tg. This reduction in molecular mobility prevents the annealing of PEEK, in particular when the temperature of exposure is higher than the onset of the melting endotherm. On the other hand, the consequences of oxidation on the elastic properties have been analysed and elucidated by micro-indentation on polished cross-sections of PEEK plates of 3 mm thickness. The diffusion control of oxidation leads to the development of profiles of Young's modulus within the sample thickness, which correlate perfectly with the changes in crystallinity and macromolecular architecture determined at lower scales. The validity of the Tobolsky's relationship is demonstrated.","['chim', 'spi']"
Spectroscopic Characterization of Disulfiram and Nicotinic Acid after Biofield Treatment,"Disulfiram is being used clinically as an aid in chronic alcoholism, while nicotinic acid is one of a B-complex vitamin that has cholesterol lowering activity. The aim of present study was to investigate the impact of biofield treatment on spectral properties of disulfiram and nicotinic acid. The study was performed in two groups i.e., control and treatment of each drug. The treatment groups were received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Subsequently, spectral properties of control and treated groups of both drugs were studied using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic techniques. FT-IR spectrum of biofield treated disulfiram showed the shifting in wavenumber of C-H stretching from 1496 to 1506 cm-1 and C-N stretching from 1062 to 1056 cm-1. The intensity of S-S dihedral bending peaks (665 and 553 cm-1) was also increased in biofield treated disulfiram sample, as compared to control. FT-IR spectra of biofield treated nicotinic acid showed the shifting in wavenumber of C-H stretching from 3071 to 3081 cm-1 and 2808 to 2818 cm-1. Likewise, C=C stretching peak was shifted to higher frequency region from 1696 cm-1 to 1703 cm-1 and C-O (COO-) stretching peak was shifted to lower frequency region from 1186 to 1180 cm-1 in treated nicotinic acid. UV spectrum of control and biofield treated disulfiram showed similar pattern of UV spectra. Whereas, the UV spectrum of biofield treated nicotinic acid exhibited the shifting of absorption maxima (λmax) with respect of control i.e., from 268.4 to 262.0 nm, 262.5 to 256.4, 257.5 to 245.6, and 212.0 to 222.4 nm. Over all, the FT-IR and UV spectroscopy results suggest an impact of biofield treatment on the force constant, bond strength, and dipole moments of treated drugs such as disulfiram and nicotinic acid that could led to change in their chemical stability as compared to control.",['sdv']
Definitions of antimicrobial resistance in veterinary medicine: Epidemiological or prognostic//Définitions de la résistance aux antibiotiques en médecine vétérinaire: Épidémiologique ou pronostique,"The definition of antibiotic resistance in bacteria differs if it is seen from the viewpoint of the bacteriologist and the epidemiologist, or of the clinician and the pharmacologist. The standardization by the European Union Committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (EUCAST) led to more accurate definitions. This committee defined critical concentrations based on pharmacological approaches and clinical outcomes, and on the variability of exposure of the treated subjects. In France, the values used for veterinary antibiograms are based on epidemiological data. New funding is necessary to move to the next stage and use all available data to define clinical resistance in veterinary medicine.",['sdv']
"Antimicrobial Susceptibility, Biochemical Characterization and Molecular Typing of Biofield Treated Klebsiella pneumoniae","Pathogenic isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), particularly the extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing strains, are mostly associated with the failure of antibiotic therapy in nosocomial infections. The present work was designed to evaluate the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of K. pneumoniae. The strain of K. pneumoniae bearing ATCC 15380 (American Type Culture Collection) was procured from the Bangalore Genei, in sealed pack and divided into control and treated groups. Treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment and analyzed for the antimicrobial susceptibility, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), biochemical reactions, and biotyping using automated MicroScan Walk-Away® system. Further, the effect of biofield treatment was also evaluated using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) in order to determine their epidemiological relatedness and genetic characteristics of biofield treated K. pneumoniae samples. The antimicrobial susceptibility results showed an improve sensitivity (i.e. from intermediate to susceptible) of ampicillin/sulbactam and chloramphenicol, while altered sensitivity of cephalothin (i.e. from susceptible to intermediate) was also reported as compared to the control sample. The MIC value showed two-fold decrease in MIC value of ampicillin/sulbactam (i.e. 16/8 to ≤8/4 µg/mL) and chloramphenicol (i.e. 16 to ≤ 8 µg/mL) as compared to the control. The cephalothin showed two-folds change (i.e. ≤ 8 to 16 µg/mL) in the MIC value as compared with the control. Biofield treatment showed 9.09% alterations in biochemical reactions followed by a change in biotype number (7774 4272) in the treated group with respect to the control (7774 4274). Genetic fingerprinting was performed on control and treated samples using RAPD-PCR biomarkers, which showed an average range of 11 to 15% of polymorphism among the treated samples with respect to the control. These results suggested that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment has a significant impact on K. Pneumoniae.",['sdv']
Thermal and Physical Properties of Biofield Treated Bile Salt and Proteose Peptone,"Bile salt (BS) and proteose peptone (PP) are important biomacromolecules being produced inside the human body. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of biofield treatment on physicochemical properties of BS and PP. The study was performed in two groups (control and treated). The control group remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treated group. The control and treated BS and PP samples were characterized by particle size analyzer (PSA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). PSA results showed increase in particle size (d50 and d99) of both treated BS and PP as compared to control. Surface area analysis showed minimal decrease by 1.59%, in surface area of treated BS as compared to control. However, the treated PP showed increase (8%) in surface area as compared to control. DSC characterization showed increase in melting temperature of treated BS as compared to control. Whereas, DSC thermogram of treated PP showed decrease in melting temperature with respect to control. Moreover, the DSC of control and treated PP showed presence of exothermic peaks which were possibly due to protein aggregation. The treated PP showed higher exothermic transition temperature as compared to control. XRD analysis revealed slight reduction in crystalline nature of BS as compared to control. On the other hand, XRD data of control and treated PP showed an amorphous nature. TGA analysis of treated BS showed maximum thermal decomposition temperature at 22°C which was higher as compared to control sample (106°C). This could be due to biofield treatment which may enhance the thermal stability of treated BS with respect to control. However, the TGA thermogram of treated PP showed decrease in maximum thermal stability as compared to control. The overall results showed that biofield treatment has significantly altered the physical and thermal properties of BS and PP.",['sdv']
Special Issue on Advances in Design of Ultra-Low Power Circuits and Systems in Emerging Technologies,"This special issue on advances in design of ultra-low power circuits and systems il- lustrates a broad spectrum of challenges facing designers of high-performance and energy-efficient circuits in emerging technologies. Seeking to improve both the energy efficiency and throughput density, designers have turned to optimization methods tar- geting devices with interconnects to system-level power savings. The articles in this issue represent the cross-layer approach and span various emerging technologies, novel devices, and architectures. This issue contains eight scholarly articles, the experimental results of which show potential/promise to be ultra energy-efficient through innovation in device, logic, and architecture without compromising performance. Each manuscript was assigned to at least three reviewers and has undergone two or more rounds of revisions in the peer- review process. Overall 26 manuscripts were submitted and the following eight articles were selected based on the reviews and scope/fit into the special issue. Gaillardon et al., present a transversal survey on energy-efficient techniques ranging from devices to architectures. They look into various novel device architectures such as fully depleted planar devices, trigate geometries and gate-all-around structures that can allow reaching a high level of performance while reducing power consumption. Exploiting such devices can also lead to innovative circuits and architectural-level power management solutions like adaptive voltage and frequency scaling. Sitik et al., present a 20nm FinFET-based low-swing clocking methodology to pre- serve the dynamic power savings of low-swing clocking while minimizing the effect of leakage power consumption, clock skew, and timing violations. The technique reveals the premise for low-power/high-performance applications while achieving substantial power savings at high switching frequencies. Zhang et al., explore resource pooling where multiple architectural components are shared among the cores for improving system energy efficiency and reducing total chip area for 3D multicore processors. They present a 3D multicore architecture with poolable cache resources and introduce a runtime management policy to improve en- ergy efficiency of 3D systems. Khasanvis et al., introduce a low-power multi-state memory concept based on graphene crossbar devices. They present a multi-state memory design that can store multiple bits in a single cell. This work exploits a bilayer graphene nano-ribbon cross- bar tunneling device that exhibits negative differential resistance and hence can be used as multi-valued logic, which can be implemented along with CMOS lithography. Kang et al., present an overview of the spin-based devices and circuits by adding the spin freedom of electrons for usages such as memories and logic for achieving ultra-low power systems. This tutorial addresses various spin-based memory and logic systems; toggle MRAM, various from of STT-MRAM, Domain-wall systems, Spin-wave logic, partial/dynamic reconfigurable logic systems, and a neuromorphic framework to name a few.

Graziano et al., investigate molecular quantum-dot cellular automata (mQCA) as an emerging paradigm for high-performance low-power nanoscale computations. They provide a thorough analysis of mQCA-based circuits and a first assessment on the energy of a mQCA which is the most promising feature of this technology. At the system level, Le et al., investigate energy harvesting techniques for designing autonomous wireless sensor networks.

Time frequency and array processing of non- stationary signals,"Conventional time-frequency analysis methods were extended to data arrays in many applications, and there is the potential for more synergistic development of new advanced tools by exploiting the joint properties of time-frequency methods and array signal processing methods. Conventional array signal processing assumes stationary signals and mainly employs the covariance matrix of the data array. This assumption is motivated by the crucial need in practice for estimating sample statistics by resorting to temporal averaging under the additional hypothesis of ergodic signals. When the frequency content of the measured signals is time varying (i.e.,non-stationary signals), this class of approaches can still be applied. However, the achievable performances in this case are reduced with respect to those that would be achieved in a stationary environment. Instead of considering the non stationarity as a short coming, time frequency array processing (TFAP) takes advantage of the non stationarity by considering it as a source of information in the design of eﬃcient algorithms in such non stationary environments. Generally, this signiﬁcantly improves performance. This improvement comes essentially from the fact that the eﬀects of spreading the noise power while localizing the source energy in the time frequency domain increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Such approaches found applications in many important ﬁelds dealing with non stationary signals and multi sensor systems, such as biomedical, radar, seismic, telecommunications, and mechanical engineering.","['info', 'spi']"
Experimental identification of the overall elastic rigidities of superconducting windings,"This study deals with an experimental methodology developed in order to identify the elastic properties of superconducting ring-shaped windings, constituents of the main coil winding of a magnetic resonance imaging magnet (MRI).Mechanical tensile tests were conducted on real scale specimens associated to an optical full-field displacement measurement technique (stereo image correlation). Strain fields were then obtained from the measured displacement fields by numerical differentiation. Finally, the four in-plane orthotropic stiffnesses of the windings were determined using the Virtual Fields Method (VFM). Experimental set-up also allows detecting a possible occurrence of a delamination thanks to in-plane displacement fields.","['spi', 'phys']"
Estimating the energy repartition in micro electrical discharge machining,"This paper presents a new approach for the recording of the total quantity of energy exchanged during the micro electrical discharge machining (EDM) process. In particular, this approach allows for the estimation of the percentage of energy absorbed by the two electrodes (tool and workpiece) using a combination of theoretical models and experimental results, thanks to an advanced discharges measuring approach. An experimental campaign was executed on a Sarix SX200 micro-EDM machine with a tungsten carbide tool electrode. In particular, the process was analyzed for two different electrode shapes, a triangular and a rectangular based parallelepipeds, and two sets of machining parameters. After the execution of the experimental campaign it estimate the total amount of energy that occurred during the entire die sinking process. The energy effectively lost into the tool, into the workpiece and into the dielectric was estimated from the measurement of the volume of material actually removed both from the tool and from the workpiece. The preliminary results appears to fit those presented in the literature and the validity of several theoretical crater models was then assessed. The validation of the presented acquisition method could enable the use of information related to energy repartition in the simulation of the micro-EDM process.","['info', 'spi']"
"Secondary School Students' Perception of Teachers' Attitude towards Learning in Mathematics in Wukari Metropolis, Taraba State, Nigeria","This study was designed to investigate secondary school students' perception of their teachers' attitude towards them in the learning of mathematics. The study adopts a survey research design on a sample of 242 Senior Secondary School Two (SSS2) students randomly drawn from a population of 1210 SSS2 students in Wukari Metropolis, Taraba State, Nigeria. The analysis of data obtained via the researcher-developed questionnaire indicates that teachers have displayed negative attitude towards their students in the learning of mathematics. The results implied that students' mathematics learning is highly influenced by the actions and inactions of the teacher, consequently building in them wrong disposition towards the subject. Based on the findings of this study, it was recommended that students' evaluation of their teachers' teaching should be considered as one of the main tools for evaluating teachers' teaching and effectiveness.",['shs']

Evolution of Notch Transmembrane Receptors,Notch is the transmembrane receptor of a juxtacrine signalling pathway (Notch pathway) crucial for cell programming during animal development. The active Notch pathway is an innovation of the metazoan lineage: several major components of this molecular network are absent from other eukaryotes. The transmembrane multidomain protein Notch emerged through the assembly of both ancient and recent domains: some were probably already present in LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor) whereas others appeared during animal evolution. Data from a choanoflagellate genome suggest that the domain shuffling events which gave rise to the typical domain composition of Notch probably occurred before the emergence of animals. More genomic and functional experiments are needed to fully understand the evolution of the Notch receptor and the interactions with its ligands.,['sdv']

How can promotion agencies impact SME internationalisation ? The case of the French company SLAT,"This chapter focuses on the international development of SLAT, an independent SME which develops, produces and markets solutions of secured alimentations. Located in France, the company has more than 70 employees. The SME has mainly developed in international markets through export activities: in 2016, it realised 21.2% of its total sales abroad and its products were marketed in 37 countries. In 2011, the company decided to implement a sales subsidiary in Germany to strengthen its presence in international markets. In this process, the company was accompanied by a promotion agency which helps companies from the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region to expand into foreign markets. The authors of this chapter explain the role played by the agency in the establishment of the foreign subsidiary and the influence of a successful accompaniment experience on the internationalisation process.",['shs']

Fourier Transform Infrared and Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopic Characterization of Ammonium Acetate and Ammonium Chloride: An Impact of Biofield Treatment,"Ammonium acetate and ammonium chloride are the white crystalline solid inorganic compounds having wide application in synthesis and analytical chemistry. The aim of present study was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on spectral properties of inorganic salt like ammonium acetate and ammonium chloride. The study was performed in two groups of each compound i.e., control and treatment. Treatment groups were received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Subsequently, control and treated groups were evaluated using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. FT-IR spectrum of treated ammonium acetate showed the shifting in wavenumber of vibrational peaks with respect to control. Like, the N-H stretching was shifted from 3024-3586 cm-1 to 3033-3606 cm-1, C-H stretching from 2826-2893 cm-1 to 2817-2881 cm-1, C=O asymmetrical stretching from 1660-1702 cm-1 to 1680-1714 cm-1, N-H bending from 1533-1563 cm-1 to 1506-1556 cm-1 etc. Treated ammonium chloride showed the shifting in IR frequency of three distinct oscillation modes in NH4 ion i.e., at ν1, 3010 cm-1 to 3029 cm-1; ν2, 1724 cm-1 to 1741 cm-1; and ν3, 3156 cm-1 to 3124 cm-1. The N-Cl stretching was also shifted to downstream region i.e., from 710 cm-1 to 665 cm-1 in treated ammonium chloride. UV spectrum of treated ammonium acetate showed the absorbance maxima (λmax) at 258.0 nm that was shifted to 221.4 nm in treated sample. UV spectrum of control ammonium chloride exhibited two absorbance maxima (λmax) i.e., at 234.6 and 292.6 nm, which were shifted to 224.1 and 302.8 nm, respectively in treated sample. Overall, FT-IR and UV data of both compounds suggest an impact of biofield treatment on atomic level i.e., at force constant, bond strength, dipole moments and electron transition energy between two orbitals of treated compounds as compared to respective control.",['chim']
An Impact of Biofield Treatment: Antimycobacterial Susceptibility Potential Using BACTEC 460/MGIT-TB System,"The aim was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment modality on mycobacterial strains in relation to antimycobacterials susceptibility. Mycobacterial sensitivity was analysed using 12 B BACTEC vials on the BACTEC 460 TB machine in 39 lab isolates (sputum samples) from stored stock cultures. Two American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains were also used to assess the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antimicrobials (Mycobacterium smegmatis 14468 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis 25177). Rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin in treated samples showed increased susceptibility as 3.33%, 3.33% and 400.6%, respectively, as compared to control in extensive drug resistance (XDR) strains. Pyrazinamide showed 300% susceptibility as compared to control in multidrug resistance (MDR) strains. Isoniazide did not show any improvement of susceptibility pattern against treated either in XDR or MDR strains of Mycobacterium as compared to control. Besides susceptibility, the resistance pattern of treated group was reduced in case of isoniazide (26.7%), rifampicin (27.6%), pyrazinamide (31.4%), ethambutol (33.43%) and streptomycin (41.3%) as compared to the untreated group of XDR strains. The MIC values of few antimicrobials were also altered in the treated group of Mycobacterium smegmatis. There was a significant reduction observed in MIC values of linezolid (8.0 to 2.0 μg/ml) and tobramycin (2.0 to 1.0 μg/ml); however, very slight changes occurred in the remaining antimicrobials of treated samples. There was no change of MIC values in the strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis after biofield treatment. Biofield treatment effect on Mycobacterium against anti-tubercular drugs might be due to altered ligand-receptor/protein interactions at either enzymatic and/or genetic level with respect to anti-mycobacterium susceptibility and MIC values of antimicrobials.",['sdv']
Urban and peri-urban agriculture in Cameroon: Status and perspectives for developmentAgriculture urbaine et peri-urbaine au Cameroun: Etats des lieux et perspectives de développement,"Like elsewhere in the world, Cameroon is experiencing rapid and unplanned urbanisation. Simultaneously, there is a growing number of urban and peri-urban farmers. This paper analyses the status of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) in Cameroon. We found that UPA is widely practised by urban dwellers of all social category and provides multiple benefits ranging from employment creation, revenues, food security and environmental services. However, due to an improper planning, its non-official recognition, insufficient access to productive resources especially land and water; in some cases, UPA can negatively impact human health and environment because of an uncontrolled intensification of production systems and the questionable quality of the food supplied by urban farmers. Therefore, to build sustainable urban production systems, we recommend an official recognition of UPA, its inclusion in urban master plans; the demarcation and development of agricultural zones in cities, the design and implementation of programmes and projects to support urban farmers; intensive farmers capacity building and the promotion of urban waste valorisation through composting. Furthermore, more empirical researches are needed to provide up to date quantifiable information on UPA contribution to urban livelihoods, food security and environmental protection, and the types of relationships existing among the various stakeholders involved in UPA.","['sdv', 'shs']"
ESPRIT Method Enhancement for Real-time Wind Turbine Fault Recognition,"Early fault diagnosis plays a very important role in the modern energy production systems. The wind turbine machine requires a regular maintenance to guarantee an acceptable lifetime and to minimize production loss. In order to implement a fast, proactive condition monitoring, ESPRIT-TLS method seems the correct choice due to its robustness in improving the frequency and amplitude detection. Nevertheless, it has a very complex computation to implement in real time. To avoid this problem, a Fast-ESPRIT algorithm that combined the IIR band-pass filtering technique, the decimation technique and the original ESPRIT-TLS method were employed to enhance extracting accurately frequencies and their magnitudes from the wind stator current. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated by computer simulations with many fault scenarios. Study results demonstrate the performance of Fast-ESPRIT allowing fast and high resolution harmonics identification with minimum computation time and less memory cost.","['info', 'spi', 'phys']"

"Thermal, Spectroscopic and Chemical Characterization of Biofield Energy Treated Anisole","The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on the thermal, spectroscopic, and chemical properties of anisole by various analytical methods such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The anisole sample was divided into two parts, control and treated. The control part was remained same while the other part was treated with Mr. Trivedi’s unique biofield energy treatment. Mass spectra showed the molecular ion peak with five fragmented peaks in control and all treated samples. The isotopic abundance ratio of 2H/1H, and 13C/12C [(PM+1)/PM] in treated sample was increased by 154.47% (T1) as compared to the control [where, PM- primary molecule, (PM+1)-isotopic molecule either for 13C or 2H]. The HPLC chromatogram showed retention time of treated anisole was slightly decreased as compared to the control. Moreover, the heat change in the sharp endothermic transition of treated anisole was increased by 389.07% in DSC thermogram as compared to the control. Further, C-C aromatic stretching frequency of treated sample was shifted by 2 cm-1 to low energy region in FT-IR spectroscopy. The UV-Vis spectra of control sample showed characteristic absorption peaks at 325 nm, which was red shifted and appeared as shoulder in the treated sample. These results suggested that biofield treatment has significantly altered the physical and spectroscopic properties of anisole, which could make them stable solvent for organic synthesis and as a suitable reaction intermediate in industrial applications.",['chim']
Image filtering and enhancement using directional and anisotropic diffusion techniques,"A novel diffusion filter for low-level image processing is proposed. Analyzing the drawbacks of Gaussian convolution based regularization of partial derivatives equations, we propose an alternate method that employs anisotropic diffusion techniques to pre-smooth an image. The new technique is developed within the framework of previously proposed directional diffusion processes. Through a statistical interpretation we prove that the new filter produces consistently better results than the original version, especially when dealing with oriented textures having different spatial frequencies. Application samples are also provided in the final part of the paper",['spi']

"Characterization of Physical, Spectral and Thermal Properties of Biofield Treated 1,2,4-Triazole","Triazoles are an important class of compounds used as core molecule for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical drugs. The objective of the present research was to investigate the influence of biofield treatment on physical, spectral and thermal properties of 1,2,4-triazole. The study was performed in two groups, control and treatment. The control group remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treatment group. The control and treated 1,2,4-triazole were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermo Gravimetric analysis (TGA), Surface area analyzer, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. XRD analysis revealed a decrease in unit cell volume of treated 1,2,4-triazole (662.08 10-24 cm3) as compared to control sample (666.34 10-24 cm3). Similarly, a decrease in molecular weight of treated 1,2,4-triazole (69.78 g/mol) with respect to control (70.23 g/mol) was observed. Additionally, a substantial decrease in crystallite size (G) was observed in treated 1,2,4-triazole by 16.34% with respect to control. DSC analysis showed a slight increase in melting temperature of treated 1,2,4-triazole (124.22°C) as compared to control (123.76°C). Moreover, a significant increase in latent heat of fusion was noticed in treated 1,2,4-triazole by 21.16% as compared to control sample. TGA analysis showed a significant increase in maximum thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) of treated 1,2,4-triazole (213.40°C) as compared to control (199.68°C). Surface area analysis using BET showed a substantial increase in surface area of the treated compound by 13.52% with respect to control. However, FT-IR analysis showed no structural changes in treated 1,2,4-triazole with respect to control. Overall, the result showed significant alteration of physical and thermal properties of the treated 1,2,4-triazole with respect to control.",['chim']
Antibiogram and Genotypic Analysis using 16S rDNA after Biofield Treatment on Morganella morganii,"Morganella morganii (M. morganii) is one of the important nosocomial pathogen associated with the urinary tract infections and bacteremia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on M. morganii in the lyophilized as well as revived state for antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, biochemical characteristics, biotype number and genotype. M. morganii cells were procured from MicroBioLogics Inc., USA in sealed packs bearing the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 25829) number and stored according to the recommended storage protocols until needed for experiments. M. morganii strain was divided into two groups, Group (Gr.) I: control and Gr. II: treated. Gr. II was further subdivided into two groups, Gr. IIA and Gr. IIB. Gr. IIA was analyzed on day 10, while Gr. IIB was stored and analyzed on day 142 (Study I). After retreatment on day 142, the sample (Study II) was divided into three separate tubes. First, second and third tube was further analyzed on day 5, 10 and 15 respectively. All experimental parameters were studied using the automated MicroScan Walk-Away® system. The 16S rDNA sequencing of lyophilized treated sample was carried out to correlate the phylogenetic relationship of M. morganii with other bacterial species. Antimicrobial susceptibility results showed 32.14% alterations, while minimum inhibitory concentration results showed 18.75% alterations of the tested antimicrobials. Biochemical study also showed altered positive reactions in nitrofurantoin and indole with respect to control. Biotype study showed alteration in Gr. IIB, study II, on day 15 (4005 1446) as compared to the control (4004 1446). 16S rDNA sequencing analysis showed similar results with the identified microbe as M. morganii (GenBank accession number: AB210972) having 80% identity of the gene sequencing data. Total 1507 base nucleotide of 16S rDNA gene sequences were analyzed by multiple alignments, while nearest homolog genus-species of M. morganii was found as Providencia rettgeri (accession number: AM040492). These results suggested that biofield treatment has a significant impact on M. morganii in lyophilized as well as revived state.",['sdv']

Impact of an external energy on Staphylococcus epidermis [ATCC –13518] in relation to antibiotic susceptibility and biochemical reactions – An experimental study,"Purpose While spiritual and mental energies are known to man, their impact has never been scientifically measurable in the material world and they remain outside the domain of science. The present experiment on Staphylococcus epidermis [ATCC –13518], validate the effects of such energy transmitted through a person, Mr. Mahendrakumar Trivedi, which has produced an impact measurable in scientifically rigorous manner. Methods Staphylococcus epidermis strains in revived and lyophilized state were subjected to spiritual energy transmitted through thought intervention and/or physical touch of Mr. Trivedi to the sealed tubes containing strain, the process taking about 3 minutes and were analyzed within 10 days after incubation. All tests were performed with the help of automation on the Microscan Walkaway System in Microbiology Laboratory - accredited by The College of American Pathologists. Results The results indicated that Mr.Trivedi’s energy has changed 7 of 27 biochemical characteristics of Staphylococcus epidermis along with significant changes in susceptibility pattern in 8 of 29 antibiotics. The Biotype number has changed from the original control strain giving rise to 2 different biotypes in treated samples while the external energy /treatment given was the same for all treated samples suggestive of random polymorphism as analyzed through the automated machine. Conclusions These results cannot be explained by current theories of science, and indicate a potency in Mr.Trivedi’s energy, providing a model for science to be able to investigate the impact of spiritual energy in a rigorous manner.

EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS IN SJÖGREN'S SYNDROME,"Primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune epithelitis and recent advances in our comprehension of its pathophysiology strongly suggest a multi-step process that involves environmental factors (e.g. chronic viral infection, drugs), followed by deregulation of the epigenetic machinery (e.g. DNA demethylation, histone modifications, microRNAs), which in turn specifically affects lymphocytes and epithelial cells leading to an aberrant inflammation. This process is amplified in the case of genetic mutations. As a consequence, autoreactive lymphocytes and autoantigens are produced leading to the development of autoantibodies. Moreover, it was observed that epigenetic modifications in pSS could be reversed, thus providing arguments to suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting the epigenetic deregulation and in particular the PKC-delta/Erk/DNMT1 pathway would be effective in pSS.",['sdv']

"DETERMINANTS OF MATHEMTICS-RELATED CAREER CHOICE AMONG SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN MAKURDI METROPOLIS, BENUE STATE, NIGERIA","This study was designed to identify the determinants of mathematics-related career choice among senior secondary school students in Makurdi metropolis, Benue State, Nigeria. It explicitly focused on parents influence, academic ability, peer group influence, influence of various teaching methods employed in teaching mathematics, students' interest, gender differences and role models influences as basic determinants of mathematics-related career choice. A survey research design was employed for the study, with the researcher developed Students Career Determinant Questionnaire-SCDQ (Cronbach Alpha Coefficient = 0.82) administered to a sample of 125 senior secondary school students who want to major in mathematics-related careers. These students were drawn randomly from five different secondary schools chosen via stratified random sampling in Makurdi metropolis, Benue State, Nigeria. Mean and standard deviation were used to answer the research questions. Analysis of the data obtained from the SCDQ revealed that parents have a huge influence on senior secondary school students' choice of career even if the careers of such parents may not be mathematics inclined and the parents may not insist or suggest that their students major in mathematics related careers. The study also revealed that career choice determinants such as students' academic ability (cluster mean score = 2.73), peer group influences (cluster mean score = 2.69), various teaching methods employed in schools (cluster mean score = 3.05), students interest (cluster mean score = 2.89), gender differences (cluster mean score = 2.64) and role model influences (cluster mean score = 2.68), all have positive high influences on mathematics related career choice decisions of students. The results indicated that the various teaching methods employed in schools have the highest influence on mathematics-related career choice among senior secondary school students with a cluster mean of 3.05. Based on these findings it was recommended that mathematics teachers should endeavour to employ modern teaching methods in their classroom lessons to ensure attainment of mathematics related-career goals among these secondary school students.",['shs']

"Active thermography method using an CO2 laser for thermal excitation, applied to defect detection in bioceramic materials","This paper presents a non-destructive technique (NDT) using active infrared thermography and a thermal excitation consisting in a CO2 laser, having a wavelength of 10.6 μm, applicable for bioceramic interior defect detection. For this work we used two samples of bioceramics (Al2O3), having the same size, 16 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness. A non-defect sample it was used as the basis for the temperature differences between the healthy and the defective one. In the second sample an internal defect was created. In order to make possible the thermal excitation of the samples it was necessary to deflect the laser beam from vertical to horizontal direction, towards the material. The first advantage of this method represents the detection of internal defects in bioceramic materials, the microscopic method not being reliable in this purpose. The second advantage represents the rapidity of the determinations, just few seconds necessary for internal defect detection.",['spi']

Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Ti- 6Al-4V Parts Fabricated by Laser Engineered Net Shaping Fatigue and Cyclic Deformation of Superelastic and Shape Memory Alloys View project Fatigue of Polymeric materials View project,"Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS®) is a Direct Laser Deposition (DLD) additive manufacturing technology that can be used for directly building complex 3D components from metal powders in a combined deposition/laser-melting process. In this study, the effect of LENS process parameters, such as laser power, powder feed rate and traverse speed, on the resultant microstructure, hardness and tensile strength of Ti- 6Al-4V components is experimentally investigated. Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are used to characterize the microstructure in terms of grain size and morphology. Relationships between process parameters and the microstructural/mechanical properties are provided. Results indicate that the scale of columnar grains increases with slower laser traverse speeds while other process parameters are maintained constant. The size of the α and β laths increases with higher laser powers and slower traverse speeds. The ultimate tensile and yield strengths of the LENS specimens were found to be higher than those of cast and wrought materials, and this can be generally attributed to the different cooling rates inherent to LENS – which impacts grain size. The percent elongation to failure, however, was consistently lower than that of the wrought material.",['spi']
Hybridization of Monte Carlo and Set-membership Methods for the Global Localization of Underwater Robots,"Probabilistic approaches are extensively used to solve high-dimensionality problems in many different fields. The particle filter is a prominent approach in the field of Robotics, due to its adaptability to non-linear models with multi-modal distributions. Nonetheless, its result is strongly dependent on the quality and the number of samples required to cover the space of possible solutions. In contrast, interval analysis deals with high-dimensionality problems by reducing the space enclosing the actual solution. Notwithstanding, it cannot precise where in the resulting subspace the actual solution is. We devised a strategy that combines the best of both worlds. Our approach is illustrated by solving the global localization problem for underwater robots.",['spi']
Towing with sailboat robots,"Moving huge objects floating at the surface of the ocean (such as containers or icebergs) with boats requires many human operators and a lot of energy. This is mainly due to the fact that when humans operate such equipment, time is costly. Now, when we have time (as when robots operate, for instance), it is possible to move arbitrarily large objects, for over long distances, with a limited quantity of energy. This is a consequence of the fact that in the water, the friction forces are proportional to the square of the speed (i.e., when we go slowly, we have almost no friction). This paper proposes the use of a sailboat robot to tow large objects. It shows which control law could be used is order to (i) avoid loops inside the towing cable, (ii) avoid collisions between the robot and the towed object, and (iii) move the object toward the desired direction. The control law is validated on a simulation where the object to be towed has to follow a trajectory corresponding to a large circle.",['spi']

However, research is still limited in low-resource formal languages. This consists of a significant gap in describing the colloquial language especially for low-resourced ones such as Persian. In order to target this gap for low resource languages, we propose a “Large Scale Colloquial Persian Dataset” (LSCP). LSCP is hierarchically organized in a semantic taxonomy that focuses on multi-task informal Persian language understanding as a comprehensive problem. This encompasses the recognition of multiple semantic aspects in the human-level sentences, which naturally captures from the real-world sentences. We believe that further investigations and processing, as well as the application of novel algorithms and methods, can strengthen enriching computerized understanding and processing of low resource languages. The proposed corpus consists of 120M sentences resulted from 27M tweets annotated with parsing tree, part-of-speech tags, sentiment polarity and translation in five different languages.","['scco', 'info']"
Splitting functions into single-entry regions,"As the performance requirements of today's real-time systems are on the rise, system engineers are increasingly forced to optimize and tune the execution time of real-time software. Apart from usual optimizations targeting the average-case performance of a program, the worst-case execution time bound (WCET) delivered by program analysis tools often has to be improved to meet all the deadlines and ensure a safe operation of the entire system. Modern computer architectures pose a significant challenge to this task due to their high complexity. Out-of-order execution, speculation, caches, buffers, and branch predictors highly depend on the execution history and are thus difficult to analyze precisely for WCET analysis tools. Time-predictable computer architectures overcome this problems by specifically designed hardware components that are amenable to static program analysis. A recently proposed alternative for caching executable code, i.e., instructions, is the so-called method cache. Instead of a traditional block-based cache design, the method cache operates on larger code blocks under the control of the compiler. Due to its design, the analysis of the method cache is simplified. At the same time, such a system now highly depends on the compiler and its ability to form suitable code blocks for caching. We propose a simple function splitting technique that derives a suitable partitioning of the basic blocks in a program, targeting the method cache of the time-predictable processor Patmos. Our approach exploits dominance properties to form code regions respecting the method cache's parameters as well as constraints of Patmos' instruction set architecture. Experimental results show that the method cache can be competitive with typical instruction cache configurations given the right splitting.",['info']
A loosely synchronizing asynchronous router for TDM-scheduled NOCs,"This paper presents an asynchronous router design for use in time-division-multiplexed (TDM) networks-on-chip. Unlike existing synchronous, mesochronous and asynchronous router designs with similar functionality, the router is able to silently skip over cycles/TDM-slots where no traffic is scheduled and hence avoid all switching activity in the idle links and router ports. In this way switching activity is reduced to the minimum possible amount. The fact that this relaxed synchronization is sufficient to implement TDM scheduling represents a contribution at the conceptual level. The idea can only be implemented using asynchronous circuit techniques. To this end, the paper explores the use of “click-element” templates. Click-element templates use only flip-flops and conventional gates, and this greatly simplifies the design process when using conventional EDA tools and standard cell libraries. Few papers, if any, have explored this.",['info']

Exploring the Use of Labels to Categorize Issues in Open-Source Software Projects,"Reporting bugs, asking for new features and in general giving any kind of feedback is a common way to contribute to an Open-Source Software (OSS) project. This feedback is generally reported in the form of new issues for the project, managed by the so-called issue-trackers. One of the features provided by most issue-trackers is the possibility to define a set of labels/tags to classify the issues and, at least in theory, facilitate their management. Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence to confirm that taking the time to categorize new issues has indeed a beneficial impact on the project evolution. In this paper we analyze a population of more than three million of GitHub projects and give some insights on how labels are used in them. Our preliminary results reveal that, even if the label mechanism is scarcely used, using labels favors the resolution of issues. Our analysis also suggests that not all projects use labels in the same way (e.g., for some labels are only a way to prioritize the project while others use them to signal their temporal evolution as they move along in the development workflow). Further research is needed to precisely characterize these label ""families"" and learn more the ideal application scenarios for each of them.",['info']
GiLA: GitHub Label Analyzer,"Reporting bugs, asking for new features and in general giving any kind of feedback is a common way to contribute to an Open-Source Software (OSS) project. In GitHub, the largest code hosting service for OSS, this feedback is typically expressed as new issues for the project managed by an issue-tracking system available in each new project repository. Among other features, the issue tracker allows creating and assigning labels to issues with the goal of helping the project community to better classify and manage those issues (e.g., facilitating the identification of issues for top priority components or candidate developers that could solve them). Nevertheless, as the project grows a manual browsing of the project issues is no longer feasible. In this paper we present GiLA, a tool which generates a set of visualizations to facilitate the analysis of issues in a project depending on their label-based categorization. We believe our visualizations are useful to see the most popular labels (and their relationships) in a project, identify the most active community members for those labels and compare the typical issue evolution for each label category.",['info']

Robust Heading Control and its Application to Ciscrea Underwater Vehicle,"Deep inside the ocean, the earth magnetic signal is one of the merely existing information that tells the heading of robots with very good cost efficiency. Therefore, this paper focuses on the AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) heading control problem using only one magnetic compass as feedback sensor. In this application, we address AUV modeling and control issues simultaneously. Because of quadratic damping factor, underwater vehicle hydrodynamic model is nonlinear. In addition, unmodeled dynamics, parameter variations and environmental disturbances create significant uncertainties between the nominal AUV model and the reality. Finally, sensor noise, signal delay as well as unmeasured states also affect the stability and control performance of AUV motions. In order to handle these issues with improved AUV observation quality and navigation ability, we propose a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) model based H1 robust control scheme.Without loss of generality, the robust heading controller was implemented and validated in the sea on low-mass and complex-shaped Ciscrea AUV. Simulation and sea experimental results of both PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) and robust heading controller are analysed.",['spi']

Properties of distance spaces with power triangle inequalities,"Metric spaces provide a framework for analysis and have several very useful properties. Many of these properties follow in part from the triangle inequality. However, there are several applications in which the triangle inequality does not hold but in which we may still like to perform analysis. This paper investigates what happens if the triangle inequality is removed all together, leaving what is called a distance space, and also what happens if the triangle inequality is replaced with a much more general two parameter relation, which is herein called the ""power triangle inequality"". The power triangle inequality represents an uncountably large class of inequalities, and includes the triangle inequality, relaxed triangle inequality, and inframetric inequality as special cases. The power triangle inequality is defined in terms of a function that is herein called the power triangle function. The power triangle function is itself a power mean, and as such is continuous and monotone with respect to its exponential parameter, and also includes the operations of maximum, minimum, mean square, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean as special cases.",['math']

"Determination of Isotopic Abundance Ratio of Biofield Energy Treated 1,4-Dichlorobenzene Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)","The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM, PM+2/PM, PM+3/PM and PM+4/PM in p-DCB using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The p-DCB was divided into two parts - one part was control sample, and another part was considered as the treated sample which was subjected to biofield energy treatment (The Trivedi Effect®). T1, T2, T3, and T4 were referred the biofield treated p-DCB having analyzed at different time intervals. The GC-MS analysis of both the control and biofield treated p-DCB indicated the presence of the parent molecular ion peak at m/z 146 along with four major fragmentation peaks at m/z 111, 75, 55 and 50. The relative peak intensities of the fragmented ions in the biofield treated p-DCB were notably changed as compared to the control sample with respect to the time. The isotopic abundance ratio analysis using GC-MS revealed that the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM at T1, T2, T3, and T4 (biofield energy treated p-DCB) was significantly increased by 10.87, 83.90, 225.16, and 241.15%, respectively as compared to the control sample. Consequently, the percentage change in the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+2/PM at T1, T2, and T3 (biofield energy treated p-DCB) was enhanced by 4.55, 9.49, and 1.80%, respectively as compared to the control sample. Beside these, another two isotopic molecular ion peaks at m/z 149 and 150 were found in the GS-MS spectra due to arise from the contributions of various combinations of 2H, 13C, and 37Cl. The isotopic abundance ratios of PM+3/PM in biofield energy treated sample at T1, T2, T3, and T4 was significantly increased by 15.14, 82.57, 192.43, and 218.31%, respectively as compared to the control sample. Similarly, the PM+4/PM in biofield energy treated sample at T1, T2, T3, and T4 was significantly increased by 13.80, 86.66, 186.13, and 204.29%, respectively as compared to the control sample. Overall, the isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM (2H/1H or 13C/12C), PM+2/PM (37Cl/35Cl), for PM+3/PM and PM+4/PM (the probable combinations of 2H/1H, 13C/12C, and 37Cl/35Cl) were significantly enhanced in the biofield energy treated p-DCB. The biofield treated p-DCB has shown improved isotopic abundance ratios that might have altered the physicochemical properties, thermal properties and rate of reaction. Biofield treated p-DCB might be useful in pharmaceutical and chemical industries as intermediates during the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and chemicals by monitoring the rate of chemical reaction.",['sdv']
Kalman Filter Variants for Nonlinear Systems,"The problem of estimation of state of a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system in a noisy environment is of central importance in engineering. Furthermore it has a wide range of applications such as control system and chaotic synchronization. The process to obtain the state estimations is called filtering. Kalman Filter (KF) is the optimal Bayesian estimator for linear systems. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. Consequently, most existing methods rely on simplifying assumptions to obtain a tractable but approximate solution. This chapter presents and analyses the best known Kalman Filters variants for nonlinear systems, such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) respectively, which has been concluded in synchronization of chaotic systems.",['info']

Electric Space: Space-based Solar Power Technologies & Applications,"Innovation has delivered humanity from the caves to the ability to access the edge of space and to send robotic explorers deep into the solar system. It is the driving force in mankind’s expansion, growth and technological development. Beamed energy technology could potentially lower the cost of access to space and transportation though space, thereby lowering the cost of transporting goods and people to many destinations in the solar system and beyond. Technology spin-off from space technology investments will benefit all of humanity. Spin-offs could have a huge positive impact in the areas of electronics and instrumentation, automotive, energy (especially clean energy) and lower cost space transportation. In order for humanity to move into space to settle this new frontier innovation in beamed energy technologies will be required. In this book we will look at the topic of space energy and the technologies that can be used to generate this energy. While some of the ideas in this book go back to the original concepts many of the ideas and concepts are new. It is hoped that others will apply these ideas into even new and better approaches so that we can move into space in a really big way, but also do this in ways that are cost effective and even profitable. Access to energy in space is the key to developing its resources and those resources are required to support large scale space settlement. We don’t need to wait decades to develop the technologies for space energy because these technologies already exist. We are just not using them. These technologies can provide us with the means to travel rapidly and cheaply though space. They can also be used to power our industry and homes on Earth. We have only to utilize the technology. The development of space will depend on the availability of energy and lots of it. Once we have mastered that, all things become possible. We will be able to transport people and cargo to many destinations in our solar system, power the earth with clean and abundant energy, and tap the resources of asteroids and comets. Once we have settled the near Earth areas of the solar system, such as, the Moon, Mars and Venus we can strike out to other star systems. As the World’s need for energy continues to grow driven by population growth and increased industrialization, new options for energy will be needed. This is especially true given that reserves of conventional energy sources such as oil, gas and uranium are rapidly being depleted and that greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere are causing large scale damage to the Earth. We find that alternatives energy sources such as wind, ground solar and biomass have physical site limitations and while they are certainly desirable from an ecological prospective, are often high cost and cannot meet the Earth’s future energy needs even if fully developed. The solar energy collected by an SPS would be converted into electricity, then into microwaves. The microwaves would be beamed to the Earth's surface, where they would be received and converted back into electricity by a large array of devices known as a rectifying antenna, or rectenna. Rectification is the process by which alternating electrical current, such as that induced by a microwave beam, is converted to direct current.","['sde', 'phys']"
The Minimal Dependency Relation for Causal Event Ordering in Distributed Computing,"Several algorithms of different domains in distributed systems are designed over the principle of the Happened-Before Relation (HBR). One common as-pect among them is that they intend to be efficient in their implementation by identifying and ensuring the necessary and sufficient dependency constraints. In this pursuit, some previous works talk about the use of a transitive reduction of the causality. However, none of these works formally prove in a broad manner that such transitive reduction is the minimal expression of the HBR. In this pa-per, a formal study of the minimal binary relation (transitive reduction) of the HBR is presented, which is called the Immediate Dependency Relation (IDR). The study shows that since the transitive closure of the HBR is antisymmetric and finite, it implies that the IDR is unique. This is important because it means that all of the works that deal with a minimal expression of the HBR discuss the same minimal binary relation. In addition, an extension to the IDR to iden-tify causal immediate dependencies only among a subset of relevant events is presented. Finally, as case of study, the extension of the IDR is applied to the causal delivery of messages.",['info']

Evaluation of the Isotopic Abundance Ratio in Biofield Energy Treated Resorcinol Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Technique,"The stable isotope ratio analysis is widely used in several scientific fields such as agricultural, food authenticity, biochemistry, metabolism, medical research, etc. Resorcinol is one of the most versatile chemicals used for the synthesis of several pharmaceuticals, dyes, polymers, organic compounds, etc. The current research work was designed to investigate the impact of the biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance ratios of 13C/12C or 2H/1H or 17O/16O (PM+1/PM) and 18O/16O (PM+2/PM) in resorcinol using Gas chromatograph - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Resorcinol was divided into two parts - one part was control and another part was considered as biofield energy treated sample. The biofield energy treatment was accomplished through unique biofield energy transmission by Mr. Mahendra Kumar Trivedi (also called as The Trivedi Effect®). T1, T2, T3, and T4 were denoted by different time interval analysis of the biofield treated resorcinol in order to understand the influence of the biofield energy treatment on isotopic abundance ratio with respect to the time. The GC-MS spectra of the both control and biofield treated resorcinol exhibited the presence of molecular ion peak [M+] at m/z 110 (calculated 110.04 for C6H6O2) along with major fragmented peaks at m/z 82, 81, 69, 53, and 39. The relative peak intensities of the fragmented ions in biofield treated resorcinol (particularly T2) was significantly changed with respect to the control sample. The stable isotope ratio analysis in resorcinol using GC-MS revealed that the percentage change of the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM was increased in the biofield treated resorcinol at T1, T2, T3 and T4 by 1.77%, 165.73%, 0.74%, and 6.79%, respectively with respect to the control sample. Consequently, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+2/PM in the biofield treated resorcinol at T2, T3, and T4 were enhanced by 170.77%, 3.08%, and 12.31%, respectively with respect to the control sample. Briefly, 13C, 2H, 17O contributions from (C6H6O2)+ to m/z 111 and 18O contribution from (C6H6O2)+ to m/z 112 for the biofield treated resorcinol at T2 and T4 were significantly altered as compared to the control sample. For this reasons, biofield treated resorcinol might exhibit altered physicochemical properties like diffusion velocity, mobility and evaporation rate, reaction rate, binding energy, and stability. Biofield treated resorcinol could be valuable in pharmaceutical and chemical industries as intermediates during the preparation of pharmaceuticals and chemical compounds by altering its physicochemical properties, the reaction rate and selectivity, the study of the reaction mechanism and facilitating in designing extremely effective and specific enzyme inhibitors.",['sdv']
Mesoscale modeling of the temperature-dependent viscoelastic behavior of a Bitumen-Bound Gravels,"A hierarchical multi-scale modeling strategy devoted to the study of a Bitumen-Bound Gravel (BBG) is presented in this paper. More precisely, the paper investigates the temperature-dependent linear viscoelastic of the material when submitted to low deformations levels and moderate number of cycles. In such a hierarchical approach, 3D digital Representative Elementary Volumes are built and the outcomes at a scale (here, the sub-mesoscale) are used as input data at the next higher scale (here, the mesoscale). The viscoelastic behavior of the bituminous phases at each scale is taken into account by means of a generalized Maxwell model: the bulk part of the behavior is separated from the deviatoric one and bulk and shear moduli are expanded into Prony series. Furthermore, the viscoelastic phases are considered to be thermorheologically simple: time and temperature are not independent. This behavior is reproduced by the Williams-Landel-Ferry law. By means of the FE simulations of stress relaxation tests, the parameters of the various features of this temperature-dependent viscoelastic behavior are identified.",['spi']

The process technologies offered by current market such as MLE, MBBR, IFAS and SBR are still in with downside of higher footprint, multi tank reactors, heavy instrumentation for IR and RAS which ultimately incur higher capital and operating cost. The current market need and lack of sustainable nitrogen removal applications, trigger to review the of all available efficient biological nitrogen removal processes.

Curiosity and Languages,"The morphogenesis of behavioral and cognitive structures, which may be observed, for example, in human children during their first years of life--becoming acquainted with their bodies, with their environment and the first rudiments of language--is the focus of my scientific work. In fact, that is what led me, out of curiosity, into research. I came to this field, which would seem to be situated between the social sciences and the life sciences, in a rather unorthodox way: I design and experiment with machines, particularly robots, whose purpose is to model these processes of morphogenesis. Alan Turing had suggested using this kind of approach back in the 1950s when he demonstrated how computers could be used to help us model and better understand the self-organization processes of elementary physical and chemical structures. This approach then became very influential in certain areas of biology and ethology, for example, to develop models of how termite nests are built. For the past twenty years, a certain number of researchers around the world, including myself, have been attempting to apply this approach, via the use of robots, to the creation of models in the areas of child development and the formation of cultural structures such as natural languages. This is the framework within which Flowers Fields was designed.",['info']

Intrapopulation growth variation analysis using femur length: the case of Martigues plague victims (south of France – 1720-1721),"An individual’s living conditions, which comprises e.g. nutritional state, social status, gender inequalities and access to medical care, can influence his/her stature by 20%. Therefore, in the bioarchaeological context, stature analysis has been used to evaluate past populations’ living conditions. To reconstruct stature, researchers usually apply regression models based on length of long bones, especially the femur, which best represents stature. In this work, we examine femur length of 96 adults from mass graves located at the city of Martigues (Provence - France). They were victims of the plague episode that affected Provence region in 1720-1722, known as the Great Plague of Marseilles. It is known that, before the epidemic, inhabitants of Provence suffered several starvation episodes. Hence, we aim to (1) evaluate whether all groups, divided according to age, gender and location at the archaeological site, were equally affected by these famines; (2) investigate how differently men and women suffered from them; and (3) link the age classes with three starvation episodes in that region whose periods are known. Unlike previous studies, we directly analyse the measured femur lengths instead of predicted statures, to avoid modelling errors.",['shs']

They are interpreted as Projection pursuit models adapted to the auto-associative case. Their theoretical properties are established and are shown to extend the PCA ones. An iterative algorithm of construction is proposed and its principle is illustrated both on simulated and real data from image analysis.",['math']

Denials about Death Penalty,"France and the United States share a very ambiguous relationship with capital punishment. Hiding the Guillotine examines the question of State involvement in violence by tracing the evolution of public executions in France, where its very existence and modalities were never really explained to the population. The death penalty is an old chastisement: while important enough to remain in the punitive arsenal, it remains quite obscure today, almost as if pedagogical work on it takes the risk of highlighting and dismissing it. The question of the death penalty often crystallizes on the stake of its abolition or its retention, and the “debate” turns always around the same arguments, which, for some, have been disputed for two centuries ago…",['shs']
Telecommunications Reclaimed: A Hands-On Guide to Networking Communities,"This book is a guide on how to build a community network, a shared local telecommunications infrastructure, managed as a commons, to access the internet and other digital communications services. It was written collectively by a group of community network pioneers in Europe, activists and researchers during a writing residency week held in Vic, Catalonia in October 2018. It was a time of hard work and fast writing, but also of discussions in a friendly environment. Meant for a wide audience, the book includes practical knowledge illustrated by several hands-on experiences – a set of 32 real-life stories – as well as legal, technical, governance, economic and policy material extracted from netCommons, a three-year-long research project supported by the European Commission. Its goal is to guide the reader through a set of actions aimed at setting up and fostering the growth of a community network, but also, for policy makers, local administrations and the general public, to create the right conditions to let community networks bloom and flourish.","['info', 'shs']"
Globally Constrained Locally Optimized 3-D Power Delivery Networks,"Design of power delivery network (PDN) is a constrained optimization problem. An ideal PDN must limit voltage drop that results from switching circuits' transients, satisfy current density constraints that arise from electromigration limits, yet use only minimal metal resources so that design density targets can be met. It should also provide an efficient thermal conduit to address heat flux. Furthermore, an ideal PDN should be a regular structure to facilitate design productivity and manufacturability, yet be resilient to address varying power demands across its distribution area. In 3-D ICs, these problems are further constrained by the need to minimize through-silicon via (TSV) area and bridge power lines of different dimensions across tiers, while addressing varying power demands in lateral and vertical directions. In this paper, we propose an unconventional power grid optimization solution that allows us to resize each tier individually by applying tier-specific constraints and yet be optimal in a multitier network, where each tier is locally resized while globally constrained. Tier-specific constraints are derived from electrical and thermal targets of 3-D PDNs. Two resizing algorithms are presented that optimize 3-D PDNs standalone or 3-D PDNs together with TSVs. We demonstrate these solutions on a three-tier setup where significant area savings can be achieved.","['info', 'spi']"
"It's a question of prestige"": Climate change as public policy in Turkey","Climate change has been a preoccupation of public bodies in Turkey since the country signed the UNFCC in 2004. Before then, periodic environmental policies were enacted, but under the remit of each Cabinet ministry and without handing over central control of the Ministry of the Environment. Furthermore, no action-oriented policies on climate change were developed. The issue came to public prominence relatively recently in Turkey, but interest in the issues at state is growing",['shs']
Addressing agricultural import dependance in the middle east - Nord-Africa region through the year 2050,"The Middle East – North Africa region (MENA) is characterized by a particularly high level of dependence on agricultural imports: 40% of its needs for agricultural products are currently being met by imports, while its dependence on cereal imports is among the highest in the world. Over the course of the past several decades, a combination of demographic growth and changes in dietary habits has led to a marked increase in food requirements. Although agricultural production in the region has increased substantially over the same period, it has been unable to keep pace with the increase in demand, partly because of limitations in terms of soil and climate and partly because of limitations in terms of agricultural policy. Regional dependence on agricultural imports is likely to continue to escalate in the foreseeable future, both as a result of ongoing demographic expansion and changes in eating habits and as a result of climate change impacts in a region already recognized as a climate “hot spot.” As a global region, the MENA region is both geopolitically complex and highly strategic. Agricultural imports place a significant burden on state budgets, and agri-food policies in the region continue to struggle with urban and rural poverty. In this situation, it is important to understand which factors within the regional agri-food system are most likely to contribute to – or, on the contrary, might help mitigate – a continued increase in agricultural import dependence. It is for these reasons that Pluriagri has commissioned, and INRA has undertaken, the study summarised here. The project began by examining historic trends (from 1961 to 2011) with regard to the resource-use balance of the regional agri-food system. Next, it analysed several potential future scenarios for the region through the year 2050. To construct the scenarios, the study made use of simulation tools that take into account the anticipated effects of climate change as well as such factors as technical innovation, improved use of irrigation, contrasting patterns in eating habits, and differential changes in demographic and economic development. These simulations suggest that dependence on agricultural imports is likely to continue to increase in the region, especially if the effects of climate change are pronounced. Taken individually, none of the three mechanisms proposed for reducing agricultural import dependence (improved agricultural productivity, moderation of dietary habits, or a reduction in food waste) is capable of correcting this trend in the Maghreb, the Middle East, or the Near East. Such mechanisms may be effective in Egypt, however, and have the potential to strengthen Turkey’s role as a net agricultural exporter.",['shs']

A new method to fabricate Fe-TiC composite using conventional sintering and steam hammer,"The aim of this research paper is to fabricate a Fe-TiC composite by a novel and simple manufacturing method. The latter is based on two cumulative processes; a conventional sintering (transient liquid phase sintering) and a hot forging with steam hammer respectively. The blinder phase of the studied simples is varied from carbon steel to high alloy steel using alloying additive powders. The obtained outcomes showed that after the sintering process, the relative density of the performed simples is improved from 86% to 95.8% without any densification process. Otherwise, in order to ensure maximum densification and enhance in addition the solubility of the alloying additives the hot forging process is then applied. Indeed, the final obtained composite product is a TiC-strengthened steel with a relative density around 99% (about 6.5 g/cm3 of density) wherein 30% (wt.) of spherical and semi-spherical TiC particles are homogeneously distributed in the metal matrix.","['phys', 'spi', 'chim']"
Directional Rank Coding For Multi-scale Texture Classification,"In this paper, we propose the Local Directional Rank Coding (LDRC) method for multi-scale texture classification. The LDRC is built from an extended notion of local extrema gray level .The LDRC collects directional information representing the rank order of the central pixel gray level calculated in four principal orientations in 3×3 neighborhood pixel. The four ranks are combined to get the final code. The LDRC produces 81 patterns. Multi-scale LDRC is calculated by altering the window size around a central pixel but the number of samples is restricted to eight neighbors by local averaging. So, the number of bins in a single scale LDRC histogram is kept small and constant. The proposed LDRC is evaluated on representative texture databases. The LDRC achieves good performance highly comparable to a recent state-of –the – art LBP variants.",['info']

"Is Irish music ""between Tradition and Modernity""?","The last two decades have been in Ireland a period of strong economic growth, followed by an equally strong recession, and the concrete results are easily visible in the towns and cities across the country, and arguably also on people's faces. The evolution of social behaviours, possibly less visible, is equally marked. As such, one of the most common expressions heard from commentators or journalists, but also from scholars, is that Ireland is ""between tradition and modernity."" 1 One should first note that the expression, generally intended as a kindly comment, is not limited to the various forms of cultural expressions such as music, cinema or painting but can equally be extended to fields as diverse as religion or cooking, and can even be applied to economic or social areas. Second point, this cliché would seem to conjure up the unstable balance of the country in its present state, thereby indicating the imminent possibility of a traditionalist relapse. Indeed, in the eyes of these commentators, the phrase denotes primarily a tradition rooted in the past, with an indefinable purity and endogeneity. Conversely, modernity for them points to the future and to an exogenous character. We are here at the heart of a conflict between two forces occupying both space and time. But these two concepts of tradition and modernity, however, are most often used in vague, simplistic and potentially misleading ways. Considered strictly from our cultural perspective, they may however be defined with a few specific traits: Regarded as essentially rural in its origin, cultural tradition is supposed to be marked primarily by a sharp conservatism, a strong fragmentation, as well as an elitism based on (what is now termed) cultural consumption and the monopoly of cultural expression.",['shs']
Maisons et maisonnées inuit : un modèle culturel résilient,"Dans notre imaginaire arctique, l'iglou et la banquise occupent une place de choix. L'un comme l'autre évoquent le froid, la neige, l'immensité d'un environnement sans arbres, la proximité des hommes du pôle avec la nature, leur résistance physique et leur légendaire ingéniosité technologique. L'iglou-la maison de neige-est emblématique du peuple inuit. À tel point qu'on en oublie qu'ils n'y vivaient qu'une partie de l'année, au coeur de la période froide : approximativement de décembre à avril pour les Inuit du Nunavik. Aux autres saisons, ils vivaient dans des tentes en peau, de phoque ou de caribou. Et l'on sait peu que l'iglou n'était connu que des Inuit de l'Arctique central (Canada). Ceux d'Alaska et du Groenland vivaient l'hiver dans des maisons en bois et tourbe. Quoi qu'il en soit, toutes les formes de l'habitat inuit étaient marquées par leur caractère provisoire et inscrites dans une vision valorisant la mobilité. On n'habitait guère plus de trois à quatre semaines dans le même iglou. Passé ce temps, soit on se déplaçait pour s'installer sur une autre partie du territoire, et l'on y construisait une nouvelle maison, soit on restait au même endroit mais on érigeait un nouvel iglou pour remplacer le précédent, usé par l'intensité de la vie s'y déployant. Mais pour éphémère qu'il soit, cet habitat n'avait rien de précaire du point de vue de ses habitants. Structure de neige arrondie, simple mise en forme ingénieuse du couvert neigeux, l'iglou se fond dans le paysage de l'hiver arctique. Seul le signale le mince filet de fumée qui s'élève au-dessus du dôme, lorsque ses occupants sont présents et éveillés. Dans son apparence même, il prolonge l'Inuk, l'être humain. De profil, il reproduit le corps d'une personne allongée sur le dos, une sorte de géante dont l'abdomen proéminent évoque celui de la femme enceinte. L'iglou est ainsi une méta-personne qui enveloppe, protège et répare-par le repos qu'il procure-la vie de ses habitants, à l'image du corps féminin qui entoure et alimente le foetus, l'aidant à grandir et à se développer Dans la langue inuit, les mots qui désignent les parties de l'iglou et ceux qui désignent les parties du corps sont d'ailleurs pour une bonne part les mêmes : vulve (l'entrée), gorge (le couloir d'entrée), coeur (l'emplacement de la lampe qui chauffe et éclaire), nez (le trou d'aération), dos (le fond de l'iglou), etc. Comme un être humain en mouvement, l'iglou est orienté selon les quatre points cardinaux. La taille de l'habitation s'adapte à la taille de la maisonnée, donnant une expression spatiale au corps social. Son organisation interne est d'une remarquable stabilité, tant d'une saison à l'autre qu'à travers les siècles, qui contraste avec la labilité qui caractérise l'espace extérieur. Au débouché du couloir d'entrée, la maison s'ouvre sur une aire centrale dégagée, limitée vers le fond par une large banquette surélevée qui occupe un tiers ou la moitié de la superficie totale. On s'y tient assis le jour, on y dort les uns contre les autres la nuit. La lampe (à huile de phoque de préférence) est le point central de la maisonnée. Elle chauffe et éclaire, cuit les aliments et sèche viandes et vêtements suspendus au-dessus de la flamme. Décalée par rapport au couloir d'entrée, à l'abri des courants d'air, cette lampe (qulliq) est installée sur une petite table de neige recouverte d'un morceau de fourrure. C'est un objet personnel, qui appartient en propre à la femme qui l'entretient, et qui se transmet de mère en fille.",['shs']

Embodied Localization in Visually-guided Walk of Humanoid Robots,"Humanoid robots are conceived to resemble the body and comportment of the human beings. Among the behavior repertoire, the possibility of executing visually-guided tasks is crucial for individual adaptation and relies on the on-board sensory system. However, the research on walk and localization is far from conclusive. Given the difficulties in the processing of the visual feedback, some studies have treated the problem by placing external sensors on the environment; thus neglecting the corporal metaphor. Others, despite exploring on-board solutions; have relied on an extensive model of the environment, thus considering the system as an information processing unit, abstracted from a body. This work presents a methodology to achieve embodied localization to serve visually-guided walk. The solution leans on robust segmentation from monocular vision, ego-cylindrical localization, and minimal knowledge about stimuli in the environment.","['info', 'spi']"
Deployment strategies of mobile sensors for monitoring of mobile sources: method and prototype,"In this communication, the characterization of mobile sources is studied.

To illustrate the approaches, an experimental prototype has been designed in the context of thermal engineering. The experiment is described: design, characterization, exchanges protocols of signals acquisition, movement of mobile elements (sources and sensors).",['spi']
AUV swath bathymetric sensor data fusion for Rapid Environment Assessment,"Nowadays, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) become significant contributors to Rapid Environment Assessment (REA).

The AUV DAURADE platform is a new generation of AUVs. It can acquire bathymetry simultaneously with two acoustic sensors: a multibeam echo sounder (MBES) and an interferometric sidescan sonar (ISSS). In this paper, we propose a framework to fuse the bathymetric data coming from the two swath bathymetric sensors using the theory of belief functions. Here in after, obtained results on actual data are discussed.",['spi']
Efficient dominant point detection based on discrete curve structure,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of dominant point detection on digital curves which consists in finding points with local maximum curvature. Thanks to previous studies of the decomposition of curves into sequence of discrete structures [5–7], namely maximal blurred segments of width ⌫ [13], an initial algorithm has been proposed in [14] to detect dominant points. However, an heuristic strategy is used to identify the dominant points. We now propose a modified algorithm without heuristics but a simple measure of angle. In addition, an application of polygonal simplification is as well proposed to reduce the number of detected dominant points by associating a weight to each of them. The experimental results demonstrate the e and robustness of the proposed method.","['scco', 'info']"
Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Poiseuille Flow in a Carbon Nanochannel,"The numerical simulation of a Poiseuille flow in a narrow channel using the molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) is performed. Poiseuille flow of liquid Argon in a carbon nanochannel is simulated by embedding the fluid particles in a uniform force field. Density, velocity and Temperature profiles across the channel are investigated. When particles will be inserted into the flow, it is expected that the dynamics of flow will depend on the thermostat chosen. To obtain a more uniform temperature distribution across the channel we use local thermostating near the wall. The obtained results show that velocity profile, slip length and slip velocity depends on the driving force.","['sdv', 'spi', 'phys']"
Handwriting Analysis with Online Fuzzy Models,"This paper presents the early work, done in the context of the IntuiScript project, on handwriting quality analysis.

We use an online fuzzy model to easily build target models, and to automatically evaluate the adequacy of children letters to these reference models, with respect to different aspects: symbol shape, drawing direction and stroke order for example.",['info']
Community detection methods can discover better structural clusters than ground-truth communities,"Community detection emerged as an important exploratory task in complex networks analysis across many scientific domains. Many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each one with its own mechanism and sometimes with a different notion of community. In this article, we bring most common methods in the literature together in a comparative approach and reveal their performances in both real-world networks and synthetic networks. Surprisingly, many of those methods discovered better communities than the declared ground-truth communities in terms of some topological goodness features, even on benchmarking networks with built-in communities. We illustrate different structural characteristics that these methods could identify in order to support users to choose an appropriate method according to their specific requirements on different structural qualities.","['info', 'phys']"
MATCHED-FIELD PROCESSING METHOD FOR LEAK DETECTION IN A PIPE,"This paper proposes a transient leak detection method in a pipeline system which uses head measurements in the frequency domain. A matched-field processing (MFP) approach is used to separately estimate location and size of a leak. The leak location is determined by matching the model with the measurement, more exactly by maximizing the inner product between a unit weighting vector and the measurement. This maximum occurs in the case that the weighting vector and the measurement have the same direction implying that the parameters behind are identical. Then, the leak size is estimated via least square. This MFP approach is able to use not only the resonant frequencies but also all the frequencies being invoked. Besides, the proposed method is a maximum likelihood estimation and equivalent to a matched-filter approach which maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Experiments on simulated data for a single pipe system illustrate the estimation efficiency of the MFP method. The simulation results justify that the proposed leak detection method is able to localize not only a single leak but also multiple leaks.",['spi']
Towards an Automatic Parking System using Bio-Inspired 1-D Optical Flow Sensors,"Although several (semi-) automatic parking systems have been presented throughout the years [1]–[12], car manufacturers are still looking for low-cost sensors providing redundant information about the obstacles around the vehicle, as well as efficient methods of processing this information, in the hope of achieving a very high level of robustness. We therefore investigated how Local Motion Sensors (LMSs) [13], [14], comprising only of a few pixels giving 1-D optical flow (OF) measurements could be used to improve automatic parking maneuvers. For this purpose, we developed a low computational-cost method of detecting and tracking a parking spot in real time using 1-D OF measurements around the vehicle as well as the vehicle's longitudinal velocity and steering angle. The algorithm used was composed of 5 processing steps, which will be described here in detail. In this initial report, we will first present some results obtained in a highly simplified 2-D parking simulation performed using Matlab/Simulink software, before giving some preliminary experimental results obtained with the first step in the algorithm in the case of a vehicle equipped with two 6-pixel LMSs. The results of the closed-loop simulation show that up to a certain noise level, the simulated vehicle detected and tracked the parking-spot assessment in real time. The preliminary experimental results show that the average refresh frequency obtained with the LMSs was about 2-3 times higher than that obtained with standard ultrasonic sensors and cameras, and that these LMSs therefore constitute a promising alternative basis for designing new automatic parking systems.",['spi']
Correcting a Class of Complete Selection Bias with External Data Based on Importance Weight Estimation,"We present a practical bias correction method for classifier and regression models learning under a general class of selection bias. The method hinges on two assumptions: 1) a feature vector, Xs, exists such that S, the variable that controls the inclusion of the samples in the training set, is conditionally independent of (X, Y) given Xs; 2) one has access to some external samples drawn from the population as a whole in order to approximate the unbiased distribution of Xs. This general framework includes covariate shift and prior probability shift as special cases. We first show how importance weighting can remove this bias. We also discuss the case where our key assumption about Xs is not valid and where XS is only partially observed in the test set. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method works well in practice.",['info']
Aluminum to titanium laser welding-brazing in V-shaped grooveI,"Laser assisted joining of AA5754 aluminum alloy to T40 titanium with use of Al-Si filler wires was carried out. Continuous Yb:YAG laser beam was shaped into double spot tandem and defocalized to cover larger interaction zone in V shaped groove. Experimental design method was applied to study the influence of operational parameters on the tensile properties of the joints. Microstructure examination and fractography study were carried out to understand the relation between local phase content and fracture mode. Within defined window of operational parameters, statistically important factors that influenced the strength of T40 to AA5754 joints in V groove configuration were Si content in the filler metal and groove opening angle on T40 side. The best quality joint showed joint coefficient of 90% (or 200 MPa of apparent UTS). Tensile strength of the joints was found to be determined by the proportion between well-developed and under-developed reaction zones of T40/melted zone interface. The formation of 2–25 μm thick Si-rich interlayers composed by Ti5Si3 and τ2 proved to enhance the strength of brazed interface. The creation of very thin (<0.5 μm) Si-rich layers at the bottom of the groove was found not sufficient to establish mechanical continuity of the joint and thus should be avoided.",['spi']
From dilute to entangled fibre suspensions involved in the flow of reinforced polymers: A unified framework,"Most suspension descriptions nowadays employed are based on Jeffery model and some of its phenomenological adaptations that do not take into account the possible existence of a relative velocity between the fibres and the suspending fluid when the fibre interactions increase. It is expected that at very low density of contacts, as predicted by standard suspension models, fibres move with the suspending fluid velocity. When the density of fibre interactions becomes extremely high and a percolated network of fibre contacts is established within the suspension, fibres cannot move anymore and then the fluid flows throughout the rigid or moderately deformable entangled fibre skeleton, like a fluid flowing through a porous medium. In between these two limit cases, one could expect that fibres move but with a velocity lower than the one of the suspending fluid. Thus, two contributions are expected, one coming from standard suspension theory in which fibres and fluid move with the same velocity, and the other resulting in a Darcy contribution consisting of the relative fibre/fluid velocity. In this paper, we elaborate a general model able to adapt continuously to all these flow regimes.",['spi']
Experimental analysis of spatter generation and melt-pool behavior during the powder bed laser beam melting process,"The experimental analysis of spatter formation was carried out on an instrumented SLM set-up allowing the quantification of spatter ejections and possible correlation with melt-pool behavior. Considering nearly similar SLM conditions than those carried out on SLM machines, an increase of large spatters (>80 μm) with volume energy density (VED) was clearly demonstrated on a 316L stainless steel, which was attributed to the recoil pressure applied on the melt-pool by the metal vaporization and the resulting high velocity vapor plume. In a second step, much lower spattering was shown on Al-12Si powder beds than on 316L ones. Fast camera analysis of powder beds indicated that droplet formation was mostly initiated in the powder-bed near the melt-pool interface. On Al-12 Si alloys, such droplets were directly incorporated in the MP without being ejected upwards as spatters like on 316L. Last, it was shown that a strong reduction of spattering was possible even on 316L, with the use of low VED combined with larger spots (≈0.5 mm), allowing to melt sufficiently deep layers in conduction regime and ensure adequate dilution between layers.",['spi']
Confinement effect in PC/MXD6 multilayer films: Impact of the microlayered structure on water and gas barrier properties,"The transport properties were specifically investigated from water and gas permeation kinetics, and the corresponding permeation parameters were determined. The confinement effect of MXD6 in the multilayer structure was highlighted by comparing the permeability predicted from the series model equation with the experimental data. Although the MXD6 layers were not homogeneous and continuous for all membranes, water and gas permeabilities of the PC/MXD6 multilayer film were largely reduced. Such improvement of barrier properties was related to the change of the MXD6 structure, considering that the confinement of the MXD6 layers induced by PC layers allowed to bring chain orientation and to reduce the chain segment mobility in the MXD6 amorphous constrained zones. In addition, in the case of a PC/MXD6 multilayer structure well defined with continuous layers and relatively homogeneous thicknesses, the degree of crystallinity was slightly increased.",['spi']
"Influence of SLM process parameters on the surface finish, porosity rate and fatigue behavior of as-built Inconel 625 parts","This paper is dedicated to understanding fatigue crack initiation for an Inconel 625 manufactured by SLM, using a hatching + contour procedure. In the first part of the paper, an optimum set of parameters was found to deliver the best surface roughness combined with low porosity. This process optimization, mostly focused on adjusting the volume energy density aimed at finding a compromise between an optimum densification state and a minimum number of contaminating spatters. Secondly, a fatigue test campaign has been conducted on as-built SLM samples or polished samples. The analysis of failure surfaces allowed identifying different heterogeneities at the origin of the fatigue damage for each configuration. The embedded particles on the surface of as-build specimens have been shown to play an important role in fatigue and need to be optimized or taken into account in the fatigue strength design of SLM components.",['spi']
Visible light sensitive photoinitiating systems: Recent progress in cationic and radical photopolymerization reactions under soft conditions,"Although there have been many reports on photoinitiating systems adapted to visible lights for radical photopolymerization, the challenge for the design and development of photoinitiating systems for cationic photopolymerization or concomitant radical/cationic photopolymerization (for interpenetrating polymer network IPN synthesis) with visible lights still remains open. Particularly, the recent development of cheap and easily accessible LEDs operating upon soft visible light irradiations has opened new fields for polymer synthesis. Since 2011, many novel photoinitiating systems based on organic and organometallic compounds with excellent visible light absorption have emerged and exhibited outstanding photoinitiating abilities especially for cationic photopolymerization. In this review, recent progress (mainly from 2011 to early 2014) in applications of photoinitiators and sensitive photoinitiating systems under visible lights are reported. In addition, their relative efficiencies in the photopolymerization of different monomers are exemplified and discussed.",['chim']
Ageing of polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membranes in sodium hypochlorite solutions,"In order to study the effect of cleaning operations on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane stability, ageing of two PVDF based membranes (one is additive free, the other contains hydrophilic additives) in contact with sodium hypochlorite solutions with various pH values has been studied. The aim of this experimental study was to identify the degradation mechanisms and to gain a better understanding of the effect of the (macro)molecular structure changes on the mechanical and functional properties of the membranes. In both membranes, double bond formation, chain scission and crosslinking are observed and all these processes (except crosslinking) are faster in acidified solutions than in natural NaOCl solutions (pH 11.5). It can be deduced that if ionic processes such as dehydrofluorination occur, radical processes resulting from the presence of hypochlorous acid and perhaps its coexistence with the ClO− ion, predominate in acidified solutions. The presence of non-fluorinated aliphatic or cycloaliphatic additives, which are highly reactive with bleach, accelerates chain scission at the expense of crosslinking. In the chosen conditions (135 days in 4000 ppm bleach solutions at 40 °C), PVDF chains are degraded but not enough to induce polymer embrittlement. While in the additive free membrane no significant change of the use properties has been observed, the polymeric additives of the other membrane are completely destroyed, leading to a decrease of the membrane hydrophilicity, but their destruction improves the membrane selectivity by a decrease of the average porosity.",['spi']
Characterizing Porous Media with the Yield Stress Fluids Porosimetry Method,"A new data analyzing method to characterize pore size distribution (PSD) of porous media was recently presented in the context of an international consensus on the need to develop alternatives to toxic mercury porosimetry. It consists in measuring the flow rate Q at several pressure gradients ∇P during flowexperiments of yield stress fluids through porous media. In the present work, the PSD of different types of porous media is determined with this new technique and the obtained results are compared with those provided by mercury porosimetry. A series of experiments using a given yield stress fluid with different porous mediawere carried out in order to study the relevance of the obtained PSD.Besides, the critical aspects conditioning the experimental performance of the method were also identified and assessed.",['spi']
Numerical Simulation of Yield Stress Fluid Flow in Capillary Bundles: Influence of the Form and the Axial Variation in the Cross Section,"In this paper, we investigate possible improvements that can be made to the bundle of capillaries model in order to better represent the flow of yield stress fluids through porous media. This was examined by performing extensive and progressive numerical simulations and by introducing the non-circularity of channels’ cross section and/or its variability along the channels’ axis. It is shown that if only the non-circularity of channels’ cross section is taken into account, a moderate influence is observed on both critical pressure gradient for the flow onset and the flow rate/pressure gradient Q(∇P) relationship. However, the axial variation in capillaries’ cross section has proved to be more impacting the computed flow rate/pressure gradient data. We show hence that when available pore throat and pore body size distributions are used to construct the bundle of axially varying capillaries, the obtained Q(∇P) data do fit well experimental results corresponding to the flow of a Bingham-like fluid through a bed of randomly packed mono-sized spheres.",['spi']

Multi-layer modeling of edge debonding in strengthened beams using interface stresses and fracture energies,"The onset and propagation of edge debonding in beams strengthened with externally bonded fiber-reinforced composite plates, is here examined using an innovative multi-layer formulation. A novel mixed mode coupled criterion is adopted to predict debonding initiation accounting for both fracture energies and interfacial stresses and considering different debonding locations across the adhesive layer. The subsequent debonding propagation is studied by using a mixed mode fracture criterion. The beam system is assumed to be composed of three physical components, namely the beam, the adhesive layer and the bonded plate, each one being modeled by one or several first-order shear deformable layers. Both strong and weak interface constitutive relations are introduced to model the two physical interfaces (i.e. beam/adhesive and adhesive/plate), whereas a strong formulation is used to model the mathematical interfaces between layers inside each physical components. Results show that the proposed multilayer formulation, implemented by using a multivariable 1D finite element technique, enables to calculate interlaminar stresses and fracture energies in reasonable agreement with results obtained by using a continuum FE model, but with a significantly reduced computational cost. The numerical analyses, carried out also in a parametric form by varying both interfacial fracture toughness and strength, show that although the accuracy can be improved by using more layers for each components and adopting coupled strong/weak interface formulations, the use of few layers for each components of the strengthened system suffices to obtain an accurate prediction of debonding initiation and propagation.",['spi']
Multivariate numerical optimization of an InGaN-based hetero junction solar cell,"Because of remarkable properties of InGaN, we simulated and optimized an InGaN-based dual-junction solar cell connected by a specifically designed tunnel junction. The device is simulated in the framework of a drift-diffusion model using the ATLAS device simulation framework from the Silvaco company. The optimization is done by coupling ATLAS with multivariate mathematical optimization methods based on state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. For that, we used a Python package that we developed in the SAGE software interface. The objective is to optimize the conversion efficiency of the solar cell by simultaneously optimizing several physical and geometrical parameters of the solar cell. It is an unprecedented multivariate optimization for solar cells which takes into account the correlation between these parameters. For this solar cell, we optimized simultaneously 11 parameters of the structure. An optimum conversion efficiency of 24% was predicted for this designed solar cell.","['spi', 'phys']"

"GMRS, a Framework for the Dynamics Simulation of the Boat-Oars-Rower(s) Systems","From a mechanical point of view, the complex system Boat-Oars-Rower(s) can be considered as a multibody structure on a floating base. Its study comes under the multibody mechanics and, concerning the fluid-structure interaction, under seakeeping, maneuverability and aerodynamics. The large amplitude periodic motion of the rower and the intermittent nature of propulsion, both excite the boat along its six degree of freedom. Aside from practice, the strong coupling between the rowers, the boat and propulsion can be understood, and accurately described by numerical simulation. For this purpose, we developed the Global Mechanical Rowing Simulator (GMRS), a framework for dynamics simulation taking into account the floating base. Robotics techniques have been used to describe the mechanics of the multibody system. Dynamics solving is based on the recursive formulation of the Newton-Euler equations. The inertial characteristics of the rowers are set from anthropometric models. The system is driven by inverse dynamics. The kinematics are generated using B-spline models, whose properties are exploited to allow a parametric description of the motion, offering future possibilities to optimize the rowing technique.",['spi']
Characterization of Thermal and Physical properties of Biofield Treated Acrylamide and 2-Chloroacetamide,"Acrylamide (AM) and 2-chloroacetamide (CA) are widely used in diverse applications such as biomedical, drug delivery, waste water treatment, and heavy metal ion removal. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of biofield treatment on physical and thermal properties of amide group containing compounds (AM and CA). The study was performed in two groups (control and treated). The control group remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treated group. The control and treated compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and surface area analysis. XRD of treated AM showed decrease in intensity of peaks as compared to control sample. However, the treated AM showed increase in volume of unit cell (0.16%) and molecular weight (0.16%) as compared to control. The crystallite size was decreased by 33.34% in treated AM as compared to control Whereas, the XRD diffractogram of treated CA showed increase in intensity of crystalline peaks as compared to control. The percentage volume of unit cell (-1.92%) and molecular weight (-1.92%) of treated CA were decreased as compared to control. However, significant increase in crystallite size (129.79%) was observed in treated CA as compared to control. DSC of treated AM showed increase in melting temperature as compared to control sample. Similarly, the treated CA also showed increase in melting temperature with respect to control. Latent heat of fusion (∆H) was significantly changed in treated AM and CA as compared to control samples. TGA showed increase in thermal stability of treated AM and CA which was evidenced by increase in thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) as compared to control. Surface area analysis of treated AM showed increase (31.6%) in surface area as compared to control. However, a decrease (30.9%) in surface area was noticed in treated CA as compared to control. Study results suggest that biofield treatment has significant impact on the physical and thermal properties of AM and CA.",['chim']

"Topographic surface modelling using raster grid datasets by GMT: example of the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, Pacific Ocean","The study area is focused on the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, North Pacific Ocean. This region is geologically complex, notable for the lithosphere activity, tectonic plates subduction and active volcanism. The submarine geomorphology is complicated through terraces, slopes, seamounts and erosional processes. Understanding geomorphic features of such a region requires precise modelling and e effective visualization of the high-resolution data sets. Therefore, current research presents a Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) based algorithm proposing a solution for e effective data processing and precise mapping: iterative module-based scripting for the automated digitizing and modelling. Methodology consists of the following steps: topographic mapping of the raster grids, marine gravity and geoid; semi-automatic digitizing of the orthogonal cross-section pro les; modelling geomorphic trends of the gradient slopes; computing raster surfaces from the xyz data sets by modules nearneighbor and XYZ2grd. Several types of the cartographic projections were used: oblique Mercator, Mercator cylindrical, conic equal-area Albers, conic equidistant. The cross-section geomorphic profiles in a perpendicular direction across the two selected segments of the trench were automatically digitized. Developed algorithm of the semi-automated digitizing of the profiles enabled to visualize gradients of the slope steepness of the trench. The data were then modelled to show gradient variations in its two segments. The results of the comparative geomorphic analysis of northern and southern transects revealed variations in different parts of the trench. Presented research provided more quantitative insights into the structure and settings of the submarine landforms of the hadal trench that still remains a question for the marine geology. The research demonstrated the e effectiveness of the GMT: a variety of modules, approaches and tools that can be used to produce high-quality mapping and graphics. The GMT listings are provided for repeatability.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"
Certain rock engravings at Mount Bego were sundialsCertaines gravures du mont Bégo étaient des cadrans solaires,"Around 2000 BC, over 35,000 engravings were carried out on the rocks of the Mount Bego region in the Alpes-Maritimes in Southern France (Commune of Tende). The Bronze Age populations repeated the same figures each summer at between 2,000 and 2,600 meters above sea Jevel. Near/y half of these petroglyphs are rectangular forms with two horns above, schema tic representations of bovines (Fig. 2). Other iconographie themes are hundreds of daggers, ha/bards and geometric forms, including possible divisions into sections. Engraved harnesses attest that there was already domestication of bovids. After a survey andsome ten years of study it would seem that four rocks are measuring instruments for solar time. Two engraved rocks in particular were used as seasonal solar sundials.Aux alentours de 2000 ans avant notre ère, plus de 35 000 gravures rupestres ont été inscrites sur les roches de la région du Mont Bégo dans les Alpes-Maritimes du sud de la France (commune de Tende).

Structural and Physical Properties of Biofield Treated Thymol and Menthol,"Thymol and menthol are naturally occurring plant derived compounds, which have excellent pharmaceutical and antimicrobial applications. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy on physical and structural characteristics of thymol and menthol. The control and biofield treated compounds (thymol and menthol) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). XRD study revealed increase in intensity of the XRD peaks of treated thymol, which was correlated to high crystallinity of the treated sample. The treated thymol showed significant increase in crystallite size by 50.01% as compared to control. However, the treated menthol did not show any significant change in crystallite size as compared to control. DSC of treated menthol showed minimal increase in melting temperature (45ºC) as compared to control (44ºC). The enthalpy (∆H) of both the treated compounds (thymol and menthol) was decreased as compared to control samples which could be due the high energy state of the powders. TGA analysis showed that thermal stability of treated thymol was increased as compared to control; though no change in thermal stability was noticed in treated menthol. FT-IR spectrum of treated thymol showed increase in wave number of –OH stretching vibration peak (14 cm-1) as compared to control. Whereas, the FT-IR spectrum of treated menthol showed appearance of new stretching vibration peaks in the region of 3200-3600 cm-1 which may be attributed to the presence of hydrogen bonding in the sample as compared to control. Overall, the result showed that biofield treatment has substantially changed the structural and physical properties of thymol and menthol.",['chim']

XRD data revealed that lattice parameter and unit cell volume of treated Al4C3 samples were increased by 0.33 and 0.66% respectively, as compared to control. The density of treated Al4C3 samples was reduced upto 0.65% as compared to control. In addition, the molecular weight and crystallite size of treated Al4C3 samples were increased upto 0.66 and 249.53% respectively as compared to control. Furthermore, surface area of treated Al4C3 sample was increased by 5% as compared to control. The FT-IR spectra revealed no significant change in absorption peaks of treated Al4C3 samples as compared to control. Thus, XRD and surface area results suggest that biofield treatment has substantially altered the physical and structural properties of treated Al4C3 powder.",['phys']
Spectroscopic Characterization of Biofield Treated Metronidazole and Tinidazole,"Metronidazole and tinidazole are widely used antimicrobial drugs against Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria. The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on metronidazole and tinidazole using FT-IR and UV spectroscopy. The study was carried out in two groups i.e. control and treatment. Treatment groups were subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment while no treatment was given to control group. FT-IR spectrum of treated metronidazole showed the impact of biofield treatment on frequency of characteristic functional groups such as C=C (imidazole ring) stretching was appeared at lower frequency i.e. from 1600 cm-1 to 1553 cm-1. Likewise, NO2 asymmetric stretching and C-N symmetric stretching were appeared at higher wave number i.e. 1479 cm-1 to 1501 cm-1 and 1070 cm-1 to 1077 cm-1, respectively. FT-IR spectrum of tinidazole showed shifting in absorption peak of C-N stretching to higher wavenumber from 1002 cm-1 (control) to 1022 cm-1. The wavenumber of aromatic C=C bond (in imidazole) was shifted to lower frequency, which could be due to increases in conjugation effect. Further, increases in wavenumber of NO2 and C-N in treated sample suggested the increased force constant and bond strength as compared to control. Because of higher conjugation effect and increased bond strength, the molecule supposed to be more stable. The UV spectra of both metronidazole and tinidazole showed the similar patterns of lambda max (λmax) with respect to their control. The FT-IR results of both drugs suggest that there was an impact of biofield treatment on atomic level of metronidazole and tinidazole, as compared to control.",['sdv']
An Intelligent Safety System for Human-Centered Semi-autonomous Vehicles,"Nowadays, automobile manufacturers make efforts to develop ways to make cars fully safe. Monitoring driver's actions by computer vision techniques to detect driving mistakes in real-time and then planning for autonomous driving to avoid vehicle collisions is one of the most important issues that has been investigated in the machine vision and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The main goal of this study is to prevent accidents caused by fatigue, drowsiness, and driver distraction. To avoid these incidents, this paper proposes an integrated safety system that continuously monitors the driver's attention and vehicle surroundings, and finally decides whether the actual steering control status is safe or not. For this purpose, we equipped an ordinary car called FARAZ with a vision system consisting of four mounted cameras along with a universal car tool for communicating with surrounding factory-installed sensors and other car systems, and sending commands to actuators. The proposed system leverages a scene understanding pipeline using deep convolutional encoder-decoder networks and a driver state detection pipeline. We have been identifying and assessing domestic capabilities for the development of technologies specifically of the ordinary vehicles in order to manufacture smart cars and eke providing an intelligent system to increase safety and to assist the driver in various conditions/situations.","['scco', 'info']"
Environmentally-Mediated Epigenetic Effects: Uncovering the Fertile Soil in the Development of Pediatric Cancer,"Environmentally-induced epigenetic changes of gene regulation could result from chronic, lifelong exposure, to low doses of environmental toxicants, such as chemicals including, tobacco smoking and endocrine disrupting compounds, or to other environmental factors such as nutritional changes, and lifestyle-related conditions. These environmentally-acquired epigenetic marks may influence the control of gene regulation through DNA methylation, histone modification, or through a large set of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These epigenetic effects might be passed on to the developing embryo and child as inheritable non-genetic marks, which recapitulate previous lifelong history of exposure to environmental influences that start from the stage of primordial germ cell, passing through the maturing germ cell, and ending by the zygote stage.

Measuring Inconsistencies Propagation from Change Operation Based on Ontology Partitioning,"Inconsistency measure is an activity related to the ontology evolution. Being a coherent entity, an ontology must change and a modification operation in ontology could generate inconsistencies in its other parts. It is then important to measure these inconsistencies and follow the impact propagation. In this paper, we propose an inconsistency measure of an ontological change and its propagation effects on the other entities of the ontology. The measure is based on the weight of the dependencies between concepts in a community. Ontology is divided into communities which are a set of concepts that have preferential relations. To follow the impact propagation, we propose a process that uses the Change-and-Fix' approach to mark the impacted entities.",['info']
Biofield Treatment: A Potential Strategy for Modification of Physical and Thermal Properties of Indole,"Indole compounds are important class of therapeutic molecules, which have excellent pharmaceutical applications. The objective of present research was to investigate the influence of biofield treatment on physical and thermal properties of indole. The study was performed in two groups (control and treated).

The control and treated samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. XRD study demonstrated the increase in crystalline nature of treated indole as compared to control. Additionally, the treated indole showed increase in crystallite size by 2.53% as compared to control. DSC analysis of treated indole (54.45ºC) showed no significant change in melting temperature (Tm) in comparison with control sample (54.76ºC). A significant increase in latent heat of fusion (ΔH) by 30.86% was observed in treated indole with respect to control. Derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) of treated indole showed elevation in maximum thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) 166.49ºC as compared to control (163.37ºC). This was due to increase in thermal stability of indole after biofield treatment. FT-IR analysis of treated indole showed increase in frequency of N-H stretching vibrational peak by 6 cm-1 as compared to control sample. UV spectroscopy analysis showed no alteration in absorption wavelength (λmax) of treated indole with respect to control.

"The Potential Impact of Biofield Treatment on Physical, Structural and Mechanical Properties of Stainless Steel Powder","Stainless steel (SS) has gained extensive attention due to its high corrosion resistance, low maintenance, familiar lustre, and superior mechanical properties. In SS, the mechanical properties are closely related with crystal structure, crystallite size, and lattice strain. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of biofield treatment on structural, physical and mechanical properties of SS powder. SS (Grade-SUS316L) powder was divided into two parts denoted as control and treatment. The treatment part was received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Control and treated SS samples were characterized using particle size analyzer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Result showed that biofield treatment has significantly reduced the particle size d10, d50, d90, and d99 (size, below which 10, 50, 90, and 99% particles were present, respectively) of SS powder up to 7.42, 12.93, 30.23, and 41.38% respectively, as compared to control. XRD result showed that the unit cell volume of SS was altered after biofield treatment. Moreover, crystallite size was significantly reduced upto 70% in treated SS as compared to control. The yield strength calculated using Hall-Petch equation, was significantly increased upto 216.5% in treated SS, as compared to control. This could be due to significant reduction of crystallite size in treated SS after biofield treatment. In FT-IR spectra, intensity of the absorption peak at wavenumber 1107 cm-1 (control) attributing to Fe-O-H bond was diminished in case of treated SS. These findings suggest that biofield treatment has substantially altered the structural, physical and mechanical properties of treated SS powder.",['phys']

Bacterial Identification Using 16S rDNA Gene Sequencing and Antibiogram Analysis on Biofield Treated Pseudomonas fluorescens,"Biofield therapies have been reported to improve the quality of life as compared to other energy medicine. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens) for antimicrobial sensitivity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), biochemical reactions, and biotype number. P. fluorescens cells were procured from MicroBioLogics Inc., USA in sealed packs bearing the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 49838) number and divided in control and treated group. The effect was evaluated on day 10, and 159 after biofield treatment in lyophilized state. Further study was performed on day 5, 10, and 15 after retreatment on day 159 in revived state as per study design. All experimental parameters were studied using automated MicroScan Walk-Away® system. The 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to correlate the phylogenetic relationship of P. fluorescens with other bacterial species after treatment. The results showed improved sensitivities and decreased MIC value of aztreonam, cefepime, moxifloxacin, and tetracycline in revived and lyophilized treated sample with respect to the control. Arginine, cetrimide, kanamycin, and glucose showed altered biochemical reactions after biofield treatment with respect to control. Biotype numbers were altered along with species in lyophilized as well as in revived group. Based on nucleotides homology and phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA gene sequencing, treated sample was detected to be Pseudomonas entomophila (GenBank Accession Number: AY907566) with 96% identity of gene sequencing data, which was nearest homolog species to P. fluorescens (Accession No. EF672049).

Architecting Time-Critical Big-Data (preprint),"— Current infrastructures for developing big-data applications are able to process –via big-data analytics-huge amounts of data, using clusters of machines that collaborate to perform parallel computations. However, current infrastructures were not designed to work with the requirements of time-critical applications; they are more focused on general-purpose applications rather than time-critical ones. Addressing this issue from the perspective of the real-time systems community, this paper considers time-critical big-data. It deals with the definition of a time-critical big-data system from the point of view of requirements, analyzing the specific characteristics of some popular big-data applications.

"Physical, Thermal, and Spectroscopic Characterization of Biofield Energy Treated Methyl-2-Naphthyl Ether","Methyl-2-naphthyl ether (MNE) is an organic compound and used as the primary moiety for the synthesis of several antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents. This study was attempted to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on the physical, thermal, and spectroscopic properties of MNE. The study was carried out in two groups i.e., control and treated. The treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Afterward, the control and treated samples of MNE were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyzer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis-derivative thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DTG), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The XRD study exhibited the decrease in average crystallite size by 30.70%. The surface area analysis showed 5.32% decrease in surface area of the treated sample with respect to the control. The DSC thermogram of treated MNE exhibited no significant change in the melting temperature; however, the latent heat of fusion was slightly increased (0.83%) after biofield treatment as compared to the control sample. The TGA analysis showed the onset temperature of thermal degradation at 158℃ in the control sample that was reduced to 124℃ after biofield treatment. The result showed about 21.52% decrease in onset temperature of thermal degradation of treated MNE as compared to the control. Similarly, the end-set temperature of thermal degradation was also reduced by 13.51% after biofield treatment with respect to the control. The FT-IR and UV spectroscopic studies did not show any changes in the wavenumber and wavelength, respectively in treated MNE with respect to the control. Overall, the XRD, surface area and thermal analysis suggest that biofield treatment has the impact on physical and thermal properties of the treated MNE as compared to the control.",['chim']
Electronic monitoring of offenders on home detention sentences in France,Electronic monitoring consists in confining convicted offenders to their residence during time frames set by the sentencing judge. Information relative to an offender’s movements is electronically relayed to a computer in a monitoring station. The computer monitor displays alert messages in case of delay or absence. This technically provides supervising officers with an opportunity to track offenders’ whereabouts – which they do by phone at first.,['shs']
DE LA NUMERISATION VERS l’UBERISATION’ DE L’UNIVERSITE :,"Le triple rôle des universités en tant qu’établissements d’éducation du plus haut niveau, de recherche avancée et d'innovation de pointe, place, comme processus de création des connaissances et moteurs de cette ambition, les universités en lien avec les Entreprises et la Société de la Connaissance. Cela s'est traduit dans les politiques menées par les gouvernements de différents pays : aussi il est intéressant que les universités/écoles de la Russie puissent évoluer leur « e-formation numérique » afin d’exprimer tout leur potentiel à l’international en Europe et dans le Monde. Nous représentons à l’édition 2017 de GAIDAR FORUM le cas français qui a adopté les dispositifs concernant l'apprentissage depuis longtemps: il s’agit ainsi de la Loi 2004 relative à la formation professionnelle « …mesures pour la formation professionnelle – droit individuel à la formation pour les salariés, recours à l'apprentissage, contrats de professionnalisation, financement des actions des formations ». Ces dispositifs à l’exemple français ouvrent la possibilité de coopérations entre le secteur public et les entreprises, notamment à travers les perspectives par les voies de e-formation. Suite à l'étude de divers projets que nous avons menés à l’Université Paris 13 au laboratoire Centre d’Economie Paris Nord (CEPN) et avec l’Association Internationale des Professeurs et Maîtres de Conférences des Universités, nous nous interrogeons sur la problématique de la section du Forum: quel sera le rôle des universités et des universitaires pour des programmes de e-formations numériques et pour quels quatre scénarios prospectifs de l’Université (publique ou privée) - l’Ecole Supérieure de Business – Entreprise sont-ils viables ? A l’égard du scénario projectif de la « numérisation » de l’enseignement supérieur vers celui d’« ubérisation » … quelle sera la réponse systémique de leadership pour la Société de la Connaissance ? Aux quatre scénarios plutôt « classiques » proposés par l’OCDE, nous rajoutons un scénario assez récent, celui que nous appellerons « Uber Université » à la proposition à l’exemple d’Uber géré par les plateformes numériques. Les plateformes sont des moyens numériques permettant d’obtenir des gains de productivité en exploitant les actifs sous-utilisés et en générant par l’agrégation des informations un apprentissage exponentiel des comportements et des habitudes. Les plateformes sont les fruits de l’économie collaborative : Uber, Airbnb, Blablacar avec des ressources mobilisées de leurs utilisateurs (voitures, chambres et appartements, services de livraison) ou, encore … le temps (babysitting), l’affection et l’émotion (Meetic)... On note que la connaissance est une ressource du consommateur qui est souvent sous-utilisée, à cause de son développement assez progressive dans l’économie collaborative (Bénavent, 2016). L’individu actuel met en disposition ses connaissances et ses compétences au profit des entreprises ou des plateformes d’entreprises créatives (ex : eYeka, plateforme de Crowdsourcing qui remplacerait la R&D des entreprises), une approche que nous avons appelée pour les pratiques de consommation entre 2003-2015 « Knowledge Marketing » (Curbatov, 2015). Cette connaissance d’utilisateur pourra être utilisée comme une ressource sous-utilisée pour l’apprentissage des individus. On notera pour le scénario de l’Université ‘ubérisée’ que les individus ne souhaitent pas forcement coopérer, mais que c’est la plateforme numérique via son algorithme qui coopère pour eux. Ceci est une ‘perspective proche’ ( www.kokoroe.fr/ ou l’antenne de l’Université Free42 à Silicon Valey) pour les futurs étudiants ou les employés des entreprises: en réduisant des coûts d’apprentissage et des formations, les utilisateurs se mettent en relation et en collaboration en mettant à disposition de tous leurs connaissances ‘à la demande’, sur l’espace numérique ou physique et en dégageant un apprentissage géré par les plateformes numériques SANS coordination d’institutions d’enseignement public ou privé, entreprises et surtout SANS professeurs qualifiés. C’est l’économie de partage qui prendra différentes formes de formation et d’apprentissage selon la création des ressources immatérielles comme « nouvelles connaissance d’utilisateur » et qui permettra de délivrer un service d’apprentissage, voire une qualification à un métier. Il suffirait à l’étudiant/apprenti de faire sa requête de formation, l’algorithme identifiera en fonction du profil de l’utilisateur nomade (grâce à un Big-Data de connaissances, biologiques, etc… avec le modèle de la recherche scientifique qui sera également uberisée, à savoir : qui possède des connaissances à co-ré-apprendre, où se trouve cette personne ou ce groupe de personnes et quand sont-ils disponibles et à quel endroit (physique ou numérique). Le rôle de l’université ‘uberisée’ consistera à agréger diverses informations sur les apprentissages des individus, à automatiser en rapprochant des agendas des co-apprenants et, c’est la plateforme qui définira le ‘prix’ la formation. Le principe essentiel d’un tel fonctionnement ne consiste pas à un simple transfert des documents, MOOC/cours en ligne/consultation des forums… Ce qui sera spécifique et diffèrent, sera la coordination numérique, la capacité d’orchestrer un nombre considérable de relations entre les prestataires de connaissances, d’utilisateurs et des entreprises, d’un ordre de grandeur pouvant s’exprimer en dizaine ou centaines de millions. Il s’agit d’une véritable rencontre des personnes en ligne et en présentiel avec un apprentissage. A l’issue de divers apprentissages effectués et des données des Big Data transformés par des plateformes, ils délivreront un diplôme d’enseignement par ladite « Uber Université » qui probablement serait reconnu par les entreprises ou par les communautés des pratiques (clusters) connues. L’Université sans enseignants-chercheurs sans souveraineté individuelle ou nationale serait-elle submergée par ce scénario proche?",['shs']
"Investigation of Biofield Treatment on Antimicrobial Susceptibility, Biochemical Reaction Pattern and Biotyping of Enteropathogenic Multidrug-Resistant Escherichia coli Isolates","Study background: Multidrug resistant Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli) has become a major health concern, and failure of treatment leads to huge health burden. Aim of the present study was to determine the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment on E. coli. Methods: Four MDR clinical lab isolates (LSs) of E. coli (LS 8, LS 9, LS 10, and LS 11) were taken and divided into two groups i.e. control and biofield treated. Control and treated samples were identified with respect to its antimicrobial sensitivity assay, biochemical study and biotype number using MicroScan Walk-Away® system. The analysis was done on day 10 after biofield treatment and compared with its respective control group. Results: Antimicrobial sensitivity assay showed 50% alteration in sensitivity of total tested antimicrobials in treated group of MDR E. coli isolates. MIC results showed the alteration in MIC of about 40.63% antimicrobials out of thirty two tested antimicrobials, after biofield treatment in clinical isolates of E. coli. Ticarcillin/k-clavulanate showed improved sensitivity (R → I) with decreased MIC value in LS 9 as compared to control. A fourfold and twofold decreased in MIC values were reported in case of piperacillin/tazobactam (in LS 9) and chloramphenicol (in LS 8), respectively as compared to respective control. Biochemical study showed a 39.39% alteration in biochemical reactions after treatment among four isolates of E. coli as compared to control. A significant change in biotype numbers were reported in three clinical isolates (i.e. LS 8, LS 9, and LS 11) of MDR E. coli as compared to control. On the basis of changed biotype number (7774 5272) after biofield treatment, organism with maximum probability was identified as Enterobacter aerogenes in LS 8 as compared to control, (E. coli, 7711 5012). Conclusion: Overall results suggest that Mr Trivedi’s biofield treatment has a significant effect on altering the antimicrobial sensitivity, biochemical reactions and biotype number of MDR isolates of E. Coli.",['sdv']
A Light Booth for Macro-Pictures,"Paper conservators often take pictures of their objects before and after treatment. Macro-pictures in particular are useful tomonitorcolourchanges, removal ofmaterial, or ink diffusion possibly occurring on a millimetre scale. Their reliability however strongly depends on lighting reproducibility, which is not easy to achieve with conventional light booths. These are usually too large to appropriately monitor small-scale lighting. An alternative was found in a small light booth initially designed for machine vision lighting systems and capable to insure a good reproducibility of the light on a centimetre scale",['shs']

"Physical, Thermal and Spectroscopic Studies of Biofield Treated p-Chlorobenzonitrile","Para-chlorobenzonitrile (p-CBN) is widely used as a chemical intermediate in the manufacturing of dyes, medicines, and pesticides, however; sometimes it may cause runaway reactions at high temperatures. The current study was designed to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on the physical, thermal, and spectroscopic properties of p-CBN. The analysis was done by dividing the p-CBN samples into two groups that served as control and treated. The treated group received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Subsequently, the control and treated samples were evaluated using various analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyser, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The XRD results showed an increase in the crystallite size (66.18 nm) of the treated sample as compared to the control sample (53.63 nm). The surface area analysis of the treated sample also showed 14.19% decrease in the surface area as compared to control. Furthermore, DSC analysis results showed that the latent heat of fusion of the treated p-CBN increased considerably by 5.94% as compared to control. However, the melting temperature of the treated sample did not show any considerable change from the control sample. Besides, TGA/DTG studies showed that Tmax (the temperature at which the sample lost its maximum weight) was increased by 5.22% along with an increase in its onset of thermal decomposition temperature i.e. 96.80°C in the biofield treated p-CBN as compared to the control sample (84.65°C). This indicates that the thermal stability of treated p-CBN sample might increase as compared to the control sample. However, no change was found in the FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopic character of the treated p-CBN as compared to the control. These findings suggest that the biofield treatment significantly altered the physical and thermal properties of p-CBN, which could make it more useful as a chemical intermediate.",['sdv']

Benzene, toluene and p-xylene samples were divided into two parts: control and treatment. Control part was remained as untreated and treatment part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Control and treated samples were characterized using GC-MS. GC-MS data revealed that isotopic abundance ratio of 13C/12C or 2H/1H (PM+1/PM) of treated samples were significantly increased from un-substituted to substituted benzene rings (where, PM- primary molecule, PM+1- isotopic molecule either for 13C/12C and/or 2H/1H). The isotopic abundance ratio of 13C/12C or 2H/1H (PM+1/PM) in benzene was decreased significantly by 42.14% as compared to control. However, the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1/PM) in treated toluene and p-xylene was significantly increased up to 531.61% and 134.34% respectively as compared to their respective control. Thus, overall data suggest that biofield treatment has significantly altered the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1/PM) in a different way for un-substituted and substituted benzenes.",['chim']

An Impact of the Trivedi Effect® - Biofield Energy Healing Based Herbomineral Formulation on Pro-inflammatory Cytokines Expression in Mouse Splenocytes,"Due to the increased popularity of herbomineral preparations in the healthcare sector, a new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated consisting of ashwagandha root extract and three minerals viz. zinc chloride, magnesium gluconate, and sodium selenate. The objective of the study was to evaluate the in vitro effect of Biofield Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) on the test formulation using murine splenocyte cells. The herbomineral formulation was divided into two parts; one defined as the control, while the other part was treated with the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment performed from a remote distance by twenty renowned Biofield Energy Healers (The Trivedi Effect®) and defined as the Biofield Treated formulation. The splenocyte cells were exposed to test formulations at concentration from 0.00001053 to 10.53 µg/mL and were analyzed after 48 hours for cell viability using MTT assay. The expression of the cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and MIP-1α) was determined using ELISA assay. The cell viability data showed that all the tested concentration ranges were found to be safe with percentage cell viability at more than 80%. Further, TNF-α expression was significantly inhibited in the Biofield Treated test formulation group with respect to the vehicle control, while at 0.001053 and 0.1053 µg/mL, the expression was suppressed by 1.70% and 8.16%, respectively in the Biofield Treated test formulation compared to the untreated formulation. However, a significant immunosuppression was reported in IFN-γ expression at 0.00001053, 0.0001053, 0.01053, 0.1053, and 1.053 µg/mL by 12.63%, 2.31%, 8.31%, 9.15%, and 7.86%, respectively in the Biofield Treated test formulation compared with the untreated test formulation. The MIP-1α expression was inhibited by 8.31%, 21.53%, and 8.70% at 0.0001053, 0.01053, and 0.1053 µg/mL, respectively in the Biofield Treated formulation compared with the untreated test formulation. However, IL-1β expression was significantly suppressed by 19.72% at concentration 0.00001053 µg/mL in the Biofield Treated test formulation compared with the untreated test formulation. Thus, the down-regulation of tested cytokines and chemokines in the Biofield Energy Healing test formulation might be applicable for controlling acute and chronic inflammation in many clinical diseases. Overall, the results demonstrated that The Trivedi Effect®- Biofield Energy Healing (TEBEH) has the capacity to potentiate the immunomodulatory activity of the test formulation, which can be useful against autoimmune disorders. Biofield Treated Test formulation may also be useful in anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, stress management and in preventing immune-mediated tissue damage in organ transplants by improving overall health and quality of life.",['sdv']

Physicochemical and Spectroscopic Characterization of Biofield Treated Triphenyl Phosphate,"Triphenyl phosphate (TPP) is a triester of phosphoric acid and phenol. It is commonly used as a fire-retarding agent and plasticizer for nitrocellulose and cellulose acetate. The present study was an attempt to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physicochemical and spectroscopic properties of TPP. The study was carried out in two groups i.e. control and treatment. The treatment group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. The control and treated samples of TPP were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. XRD study revealed the decrease in crystallite size (6.13%) of treated TPP that might be due to presence of strains and increase in atomic displacement from their ideal lattice positions as compared to control sample. DSC thermogram of treated TPP showed the increase in melting temperature (1.5%) and latent heat of fusion (66.34%) with respect to control. TGA analysis showed the loss in weight by 66.79% in control and 47.96% in treated sample. This reduction in percent weight loss suggests the increase of thermal stability in treated sample as compared to control. FT-IR and UV spectroscopic results did not show the alteration in the wavenumber and wavelength of FT-IR and UV spectra, respectively in treated TPP with respect to control. Altogether, the XRD and DSC/TGA results suggest that biofield treatment has the impact on physical and thermal properties of treated TPP.",['chim']

Increasing the Output Power and Efficiency of Solar Panel by Using Concentrator Photovoltaics (CPV),"Because of gradual depletion of non-renewable energy resources, scientists have been trying for decades to search for new alternative energy sources. Solar energy being a clean, environment-friendly and profusely available energy source can either be used as heat or electricity. Due to increase in population and industries electricity demand is increasing day by day. Pakistan is facing heavy electricity short fall for a decade. Therefore, government of Pakistan is encouraging people to investment money in solar system installation. Recently, a 100 MW Quaid-e-Azam solar park has started working in Bahawalpur through huge investment by government of Pakistan. Solar power conversion to electricity through PV cells has become more favored but high price of cells and lower efficiency has obstructed its use in developing countries. One way to reduce the high cost per kWh of electricity is to enhance the performance of PV module systems. Low cost reflecting mirrors, lenses and light focusing concentrators may be a good solution. These mirrors concentrate the light intensity over the whole surface of the panel. The effect is more electrons are generated and hence the output power of solar module increases. But the consequence of increased light radiation for longer time is the raised temperature of the panel which would inversely reduce the open circuit voltage (V oc) and decrease the efficiency. To tackle this problem, a proper cooling system may be needed to sustain the PV module performance. This paper presents the comparison performance of a PV module without reflecting mirror and with reflecting mirror and manual tracking. The values of short circuit current and open circuit voltage were measured under different conditions of tracking. The output power was calculated and the values were obtained for different combinations. Findings from the experiments present that through using concentrators, a 25% mean rise of short-circuit (I sc) currents with sun tracking, can be achieved. Results also show that PV module with only tracking gives higher output than the system without tracking; but the system with reflecting mirror and tracking gives greater output power. Attractive results were obtained with concentrators and mirrors installed with the PV module. With the help of negligible power consumption by concentrators and reduced complexity compared to sun tracking, use of concentrator or reflecting mirrors would be economical compared to sun tracking. In addition to that, setup of reflectors and concentrators is easy. They are cost-effective, easy as well as don't need any further maintenance or other complex equipments.",['spi']

"Impact of Pain Management Using the WHO Analgesic Ladder in Children with Cancer in South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University","Background: The 2012 WHO guidelines recently recommended the 2 – step strategy in managing pediatric cancer pain. There is little experimental evidence to support this practice. Objectives: To describe characteristics & causes of pain in department of pediatric oncology in South Egypt Cancer Institute, to ascertain the effectiveness of WHO analgesic ladder in these pediatric cancer patients & to address side-effects occurred under treatment with opioid therapy in accordance with step 2 & 3 of the ladder. Methods: During 30 months duration from (1 Jan 2011 till 30 June 2013), A prospective study was conducted on pediatric cancer patients who complained of pain & fulfilled all the inclusion criteria for enrollment in this study. Data collected were: patients' demographics, pain characteristics & pain intensity scores. The 1st24h average intensity pain scores after change of pain therapy & reduction of > 30 % from their initial levels were used to calculate the adequacy of pain control. All patients who had persisting pain after treatment with step – 1 (paracetamol) divided into 2 groups: ""group 1"" received step – 2 (tramadol) & ""group 2"" moved directly to step – 3 of WHO analgesic ladder (Low dose of morphine). Results: The study included 133 pain cycles comprising a total of 1028 treatment days. Step – 1 analgesia was effective in 50.6% of all documented treatment days, while Step – 2 analgesia was effective in 17.02% of all documented treatment days and Step – 3 analgesia was required in 23.6% of all documented treatment days. After failure to obtain adequate pain control on non-opioid analgesics, it was found that median average intensity pain scores in the 1st24h after administration of low dose morphine as a two-step strategy (step – 3) was 1.33, which was lower compared to those obtained after tramadol therapy (step – 2), which was 3.33 and the difference was statistically significant (p value = 0.002). Adverse effects which included somnolence, constipation, nausea &/ or vomiting and pruritis were found to be less frequent in weak opioid drugs compared to strong opioid drugs and these differences were statistically significant (p value < 0.05). Conclusions: Efficacy of WHO analgesic ladder was ascertained in managing pain in children with cancer in our department. Disease-related pain was the most frequent cause of pain cycles and somatic type of pain was the most frequently occurring type. Use of low dose morphine in a two-step strategy was associated with lower pain scores, fewer drug changes for pain therapy when treatment was initiated & shorter duration of pain, but associated with more frequent side-effects than the conventional three-step WHO ladder.",['sdv']
Physicochemical and Spectroscopic Characterization of Biofield Treated Butylated Hydroxytoluene,"The antioxidants play an important role in the preservation of foods and the management of oxidative stress related diseases by acting on reactive oxygen species and free radicals. However, their use in high temperature processed food and pharmaceuticals are limited due to its low thermal stability. The objective of the study was to use the biofield energy treatment on butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) i.e. antioxidant and analyse its impact on the physical, thermal, and spectral properties of BHT. For the study, the sample was divided into two groups and termed as control and treated. The treated group was subjected to biofield energy treatment. The characterization of treated sample was done using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The XRD results showed the alteration in lattice parameters, unit cell volume, and molecular weight along with 14.8% reduction in the crystallite size of treated sample as compared to the control. The DSC analysis showed an increase in the latent heat of fusion from 75.94 J/g (control) to 96.23 J/g in the treated BHT sample. The TGA analysis showed an increase in onset temperature of decomposition (130°C→136°C) and maximum thermal decomposition temperature (152.39°C→158.42°C) in the treated sample as compared to the control. Besides, the FT-IR analysis reported the shifting of aromatic C-H stretching peak towards higher frequency (3068→3150 cm-1) and C=C stretching towards lower frequency (1603→1575 cm-1) as compared to the control sample. Moreover, the UV spectrum also revealed the shifting of the peak at λmax 247 nm (control) to 223 nm in the treated sample. The overall results showed the impact of biofield energy treatment on physical, thermal and spectral properties of BHT sample.",['sdv']
"Physical, Thermal, and Spectroscopic Characterization of Biofield Energy Treated Potato Micropropagation Medium","Potato Micropropagation Medium (PMM) is the growth medium used for in vitro micropropagation of potato tubers. The present study was intended to assess the effect of biofield energy treatment on the physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties of PMM. The study was attained in two groups i.e. control and treated. The control group was remained as untreated, while the treated group was received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. Finally, both the samples (control and treated) were evaluated using various analytical techniques such as X-ray diffractometry (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis- differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA), UV-Vis spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The XRD analysis showed the crystalline nature of both control and treated samples of PMM. The X-ray diffractogram showed the significant increase in the intensity of XRD peaks in treated sample as compared to the control. The XRD analysis revealed 6.64% increase in the average crystallite size of treated PMM with respect to the control. The DSC analysis showed about 8.66% decrease in the latent heat of fusion in treated sample with respect to the control. The TGA-DTA analysis exhibited about 4.71% increase in onset temperature of thermal degradation after biofield treatment with respect to the control, while the maximum thermal degradation temperature (Tmax) was also increased (5.06%) in treated sample with respect to the control. This increase in Tmax might be correlated with increased thermal stability of treated sample as compared to the control. The UV spectroscopic study showed the slight blue shift in λmax of treated sample with respect to the control. FT-IR spectrum of control PMM showed the peak at 3132 cm-1 (C-H stretching) that was observed at higher wavenumber i.e. at 3161 cm-1 in the treated sample. Other vibrational peaks in the treated sample were observed in the similar region as that of the control. Altogether, the XRD, DSC, TGA-DTA, UV-Vis, and FT-IR analysis suggest that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment has the impact on physicochemical properties of PMM. This treated PMM might be more effective as a micropropagation medium as compared to the control.",['sdv']

"Chromatographic, Spectroscopic, and Thermal Characterization of Biofield Energy Treated N,N-Dimethylformamide","N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is a ‘universal’ solvent and has wide variety of applications in organic synthesis, purification, crystallization, and as cross-linking agent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical and spectroscopic properties of DMF after the biofield energy treatment using various analytical techniques. DMF sample was divided into two parts, one part (control) remained as untreated, while the other (treated) part was treated with Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. The treated sample was subdivided into three parts named as T1, T2, and T3 for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Five relatively intense peaks were observed in the mass spectrum of both control and treated samples of DMF. The GC-MS data revealed that the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1)/PM in DMF was slightly decreased by 5.76% in T1, and increased by 48.73%, and 30.17% in T2, and T3 samples, respectively as compared to the control [where, PM- primary molecule, (PM+1)- isotopic molecule either for 13C or 2H or 15N]. Similarly, the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+2)/PM was decreased by 10.34% in T1 and then increased upto 43.67% (T2) as compared to the control [where, (PM+2)- isotopic molecule for 18O]. In high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the treated DMF showed similar retention time (TR) as compared to the control with an additional small peak at 2.26 min appeared in the treated sample. In DSC thermogram the heat change in a sharp endothermic transition at around 61°C of treated DMF was increased by 152.56% as compared to the control. Further, C=O and C-N stretching frequencies of treated sample were shifted by 7 cm-1 and 3 cm-1, respectively towards low energy region in Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. These results suggested that biofield energy treatment has significantly altered the physical and spectroscopic properties of DMF, which could make them more stable solvent in organic synthesis and as a suitable formulation agent in polymer/paint industry.",['chim']
In vitro Evaluation of Biofield Treatment on Viral Load Against Human Immunodeficiency-1 and Cytomegalo Viruses,"Viral load quantification is the amount of particular viral DNA or RNA in a blood samples. It is one of the surrogate biomarker of AIDS. High viral load indicates that the immune system is failed to fight against viruses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on HIV-1 and HCMV in terms of viral loads as surrogate marker. The viral load assay was performed on stored stock cultures of HIV infected human plasma samples before and after 7 days of biofield treatment using Roche COBAS® AMPLICOR analyzer. Viral load (HIV-1 RNA and HCMV DNAaemia) was considered as surrogate marker for assessment of the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment in HIV infected stored plasma samples. The viral load quantification of HIV-1 RNA in infected stored plasma samples was significantly reduced by 65% in biofield treated group as compared to control. Additionally, viral load of HCMV DNAaemia in infected stored plasma samples was also reduced by 80% in the biofield treated group as compared to control. Because, children are more prone to HCMV infection and adults are generally liable to suffer from HIV-1 infection. As the biofield treatment has reduced HCMV DNAaemia, it could be beneficial for HIV infected children populations. Altogether, data suggest that biofield treatment has significantly reduced the viral load quantification in HIV-1 and HCMV infected stored plasma samples and could be a suitable alternative treatment strategy for AIDS patients in near future.",['sdv']

Neutrosophic Set Approach to Algebraic Structures,"This book consists of seven chapters. In chapter one we introduced neutrosophic ideals (bi, quasi, interior, (m,n) ideals) and discussed the properties of these ideals. Moreover, we characterized regular and intra-regular AG-groupoids using these ideals. In chapter two we introduced neutrosophic minimal ideals in AG-groupoids and discussed several properties. In chapter three, we introduced different neutrosophic regularities of AG-groupoids. Further we discussed several condition where these classes are equivalent. In chapter four, we introduced neutrosophic M-systems and neutrosophic p-systems in non-associative algebraic structure and discussed their relations with neutrosophic ideals. In chapter five, we introduced neutrosophic strongly regular AG-groupoids and characterized this structure using neutrosophic ideals. In chapter six, we introduced the concept of neutrosophic ideal, neutrosophic prime ideal, neutrosophic bi-ideal and neutrosophic quasi ideal of a neutrosophic semigroup. With counter example we have shown that the union and product of two neutrosophic quasi-ideals of a neutrosophic semigroup need not be a neutrosophic quasi-ideal of neutrosophic semigroup. We have also shown that every neutrosophic bi-ideal of a neutrosophic semigroup need not be a neutrosophic quasi-ideal of a neutrosophic semigroup. We have also characterized the regularity and intra-regularity of a neutrosophic semigroup.

Similarly, the treated HBS also showed increase in crystallite size by 3.20% with respect to the control. Additionally, the treated PBS showed an increase in Bragg’s angle (2θ) as compared to the control sample. However, a decrease in Bragg’s angle of XRD peaks of the treated sample was noticed in the treated HBS. The DSC analysis of the control PBS showed melting temperature at 224.84°C; however melting temperature was not observed in the treated sample. However, DSC analysis of the treated HBS showed an increase in melting temperature (152.83°C) in comparison with the control (150.60°C). Additionally, the latent heat of fusion of the treated HBS was increased substantially by 108.83% as compared to the control. The TGA thermogram of the treated PBS showed an increase in onset of thermal degradation (212°C) as compared to the control (199°C).

"Introducing a Theory of Neutrosophic Evolution: Degrees of Evolution, Indeterminacy, and Involution","During the process of adaptation of a being (plant, animal, or human), to a new environment or conditions, the being partially evolves, partially devolves (degenerates), and partially is indeterminate i.e. neither evolving nor devolving, therefore unchanged (neutral), or the change is unclear, ambiguous, vague, as in neutrosophic logic. Thank to adaptation, one therefore has: evolution, involution, and indeterminacy (or neutrality), each one of these three neutrosophic components in some degree. The degrees of evolution /indeterminacy/involution are referred to both: the structure of the being (its body parts), and functionality of the being (functionality of each part, or inter-functionality of the parts among each other, or functionality of the being as a whole). We therefore introduce now for the first time the Neutrosophic Theory of Evolution, Involution, and Indeterminacy (or Neutrality).","['sdv', 'math', 'phys']"

"Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Isotopic Abundance of 13C, 2H, or 15N in Biofield Energy Treated Aminopyridine Derivatives","2-Aminopyridine (2-AP) and 2,6-diaminopyridine (2,6-DAP) are two derivatives of aminopyridines that act as an important organic intermediates, mostly used in medicines, dyes and organic sensors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on isotopic abundance ratios of 2H/1H, 13C/12C, or 15N/14N, in aminopyridine derivatives using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The 2-AP and 2,6-DAP samples were divided into two parts: control and treated. The control sample remained as untreated, while the treated sample was further divided into four groups as T1, T2, T3, and T4. The treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. The GC-MS spectra of 2-AP and 2,6-DAP showed five and six m/z peaks respectively due to the molecular ion peak and fragmented peaks of aminopyridine derivatives. The isotopic abundance ratio of 2H/1H, 13C/12C, or 15N/14N were calculated for both the derivatives and significant alteration was found in the treated samples as compared to the respective control. The isotopic abundance ratio of 2H/1H, 13C/12C, or 15N/14N in treated samples of 2-AP was decreased by 55.83% in T1 and significantly increased by 202.26% in T4. However, in case of 2,6-DAP, the isotopic abundance ratio of 2H/1H, 13C/12C, and 15N/14N, in the treated sample showed a significant increase (up to 370.54% in T3) with respect to the control. GC-MS data suggested that the biofield energy treatment on aminopyridine derivatives had significantly altered the isotopic abundance of 2H, 13C, or 15N in the treated 2-AP and 2,6-DAP as compared to the control.",['chim']

The present study was attempted to evaluate the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on soil for its physical (electrical conductivity), chemical (minerals) and microbial flora (bacteria and fungi). A plot of lands was assigned for this study with some already grown plants. This plot was divided into two parts. One part was considered as control, while another part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment without physically touching and referred as treated. In the treated soil the total bacterial and fungal counts were increased by 546 and 617%, respectively as compared to the untreated soil. Additionally, the conductivity of soil of the treated plot was increased by 79% as compared to the soil of control plot. Apart from microbes, the content of various minerals were also changed in the biofield energy treated soil. The calcium carbonate content showed 2909 ppm in the control, while in the treated soil it was increased to 3943 ppm i.e. 36% increased. Various other minerals such as nitrogen and potassium were increased by 12% and 7%, respectively as compared to the control. Besides, the level of some minerals such as potassium, iron, and chloride were decreased by 9%, 23%, and 41%, respectively as compared to the control. Apart from chemical constituents of soil, the content of organic carbon was also reduced by 8% in the treated soil as compared to the control soil. The overall results envisaged that the biofield energy treatment on the soil showed a significant improvement in the physical, chemical, and microbial functions of soil component.

"La formation universitaire des enseignants de FLE/S en France : évolutions, actualité, enjeux","A leur généralisation en 1984, les formations de didactique du français langue étrangère constituaient une originalité dans le champ universitaire français des sciences humaines et sociales (désormais SHS), du fait qu’elles reposaient sur une articulation déjà affirmée entre des dimensions académiques et professionnalisantes. La légitimation de ces filières au sein de l’Université française, qui reste actuellement encore fragile, implique que soient conjointement relevés les défis de l’« universitarisation » et de la professionnalisation du domaine (Dreyfus 2007). Par ailleurs, comme toutes les formations universitaires en France, le champ de la formation des enseignants de français langue étrangère et seconde (désormais FLE/S) a été marqué ces dix dernières années, et notamment depuis le début des années 2000, par un ensemble d’évolutions structurelles profondes et de réformes redéfinissant en partie le statut et les missions des universités françaises dans le contexte européen et mondial. Ces évolutions structurelles s’articulent à des facteurs scientifiques, en lien avec le développement des recherches en didactique du français, des langues, et du plurilinguisme, qui contribuent à structurer et légitimer le champ, et transforment les formations universitaires d’enseignants du FLE/S qui y sont adossées. Dans cet article, nous nous proposons ainsi de fournir au lecteur quelques clés pour la compréhension de cet ensemble complexe et articulé d’évolutions qui nous paraissent expliquer de manière particulièrement significative l’actualité et les évolutions de la formation universitaire des enseignants de FLE/S en France. Ce bilan analytique s’appuiera notamment sur une enquête menée en 2009 auprès d’un ensemble de filières FLE/S actuellement ouvertes dans les universités françaises, enquête menée en vue de répertorier et de rendre visibles les Masters FLE/S en France, leurs orientations et leurs modalités de formation et d’évaluation. Cette présentation nous permettra enfin d’ouvrir une réflexion plus large sur les formations professionnalisantes, qui éclaire sans doute, au moins en partie, les enjeux qui se nouent actuellement autour de la réforme en cours des métiers de l’enseignement, qui fait l’objet de vifs débats et de mobilisations fortes au sein des universités.",['shs']

The percentage of crystallite size was found increased significantly in treated cellulose by 159.83%, as compared to control sample. This showed that biofield treatment was changing the crystalline nature of treated cellulose. However treated cellulose acetate showed a reduction in crystallite size (-17.38%) as compared to control sample. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of treated cellulose showed no improvement in melting temperature as compared to control sample. Contrarily cellulose acetate showed significant improvement in melting temperature peak at 351.91ºC as compared to control (344ºC) polymer. Moreover percentage change in latent heat of fusion (∆H) was calculated from the DSC thermogram of both treated and control polymers. A significant increase in percentage ∆H of both treated cellulose (59.09%) and cellulose acetate (105.79%) polymers indicated that biofield treatment enhanced the thermal stability of the treated polymers. CHNSO analysis revealed a significant change in percentage hydrogen and oxygen of treated cellulose (%H-17.77, %O-16.89) and cellulose acetate (%H-5.67, %O-13.41). Though minimal change was observed in carbon percentage of both treated cellulose (0.29%) and cellulose acetate (0.39%) polymers as compared to their respective control samples. Thermo gravimetric analysis and Differential thermo gravimetric (TGA-DTG) analysis of treated cellulose acetate (353ºC) showed increased maximum thermal decomposition temperature as compared to control polymer (351ºC). This showed the higher thermal stability of the treated cellulose acetate polymer; although the maximum thermal decomposition temperature of treated cellulose (248ºC) was decreased as compared to control cellulose (321ºC). These outcomes confirmed that biofield treatment has changed the physicochemical properties of the cellulose polymers.",['sdv']

Transient Stability Enhancement of Power System Using UPFC (Unified Power Flow Controller),"In the power grid system, the prime subjects are to transmit power with supreme power factor and high power quality, supreme transient stability, economical and minimum risk of system failure. The constantly growth of electrical power demands and loads, particularly non-linear loads making the power system network become more obscure to operate and the system becomes unstable with large power flows without proper control and operation. The development in power system with time have brings new challenges and sometimes it is tough to operate system in stable condition due to complex system network. Though, on the other side there is vast development been made in power electronics, which helps the power system to continue in stable condition during most horrible condition occurred due to fault. One of the creation of power electronics is FACTS technology. FACTS (Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems) devices are created on power electronics and other dynamic controllers that provide control of one or more AC transmission system parameters to enhance controllability and growth power transfer capability. One way to enhance the power system control is by applying FACTS controller such UPFC (Unified Power Flow Controller). UPFC can control voltage, impedance and phase at alike time.

"Extended Weighted Page Rank Based on VOL by Finding User Activities Time and Page Reading Time, Storing them Directly on Search Engine Database Server","Searching on the web can be considered as a process of user enters the query and search system returns a set of most relevant pages in response to user’s query. But results returned are not mostly relevant to user’s query and ranking of the pages are not efficient according to user requirement. In order to improve the precision of ranking of the web pages, after analyzing the different algorithms like Page Rank, Weighted Page Rank, Page Rank based on VOL, Weighted Page Rank algorithm based on VOL. In this paper, we are proposing enhancement by including “User Activities Time” and “Page Reading Time” in Weighted Page Rank based on VOL algorithm (WPRVOL). Page Reading Time (PRT) is the total time page remains focused in browser tab. User Activities Time (UAT) is the total time user does activities like Key Press, Mouse Click, Touch the Screen and Scrolling the page etc. WPRVOL Algorithm signifies the importance of a web page for a user and thus helps in increasing the accuracy of web page ranking. Our proposed Extended Weighted Page Rank based on Visit of links (EWPRvolT) algorithm is a page ranking mechanism, which considers user browsing behavior / user using trends into account. Other algorithms discussed in literature are either link or content oriented. WPRVOL has already being devised for search engines, which works very much similar to weighted page rank algorithm and takes number of visits of inbound links of web pages into account. Also we are making one more improvement in our algorithm (EWPRvolT) by storing the no of visits on links, PRT and UAT information directly on Search Engine database server instead of storing it on client’s web server in the form of logs which was suggested in earlier literature. The proposed improvement in algorithm finds more relevant information according to user’s query. So, this concept is very useful to display most important and useful pages on the top of the result list on the basis of user usage trends, which reduce the search space to a large scale for user.",['spi']

Effect of Biofield Energy Treatment on Physical and Structural Properties of Calcium Carbide and Praseodymium Oxide,"Calcium carbide (CaC2) is known for its wide applications in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide, whereas praseodymium Oxide (Pr6O11) is used in sensors and high-temperature pigments. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of biofield energy treatment on the physical and structural properties of CaC2 and Pr6O11 powder. The powder samples of both compounds were equally divided into two parts, referred as control and treated. The treated part of both compounds was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. After that, both control and treated samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The XRD data revealed that the biofield energy treatment has increased the lattice parameter of unit cell by 3.35% in the treated CaC2 sample as compared to the control. The density of treated CaC2 sample was reduced upto 4.49% and molecular weight was increased upto 4.70% as compared to the control. The crystallite size of CaC2 was reduced from 98.19 nm (control) to 52.93 nm in the treated CaC2 sample as compared to the control. The FT-IR analysis exhibited that the absorption band attributed to C=C stretching vibration was shifted to higher wavenumber as compared to the control. Thus, above data suggested that biofield energy treatment has considerable impact on the physical and structural properties of CaC2. Besides, in Pr6O11, the XRD did not show any significant change in lattice parameter, density and molecular weight. However, the FT-IR spectra revealed that the absorption band attributing to Pr-O stretching vibration was shifted from 593 cm-1 (control) to higher wavenumber 598 cm-1 in the treated Pr6O11 sample. Therefore, the biofield energy treatment could be applied to modify the CaC2 and Pr6O11 powder for the use in chemical industries.",['phys']
"Evaluation of Plant Growth, Yield and Yield Attributes of Biofield Energy Treated Mustard (Brassica juncea) and Chick Pea (Cicer arietinum) Seeds","The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on mustard (Brassica juncea) and chick pea (Cicer arietinum) for their growth, yield, and yield attributes. Both the samples were divided into two groups. One group was remained as untreated and coded as control, while the other group (both seed and plot) was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment and referred as the treated. The result showed the plant height of mustard and chick pea was increased by 13.2 and 97.41%, respectively in the treated samples as compared to the control. Additionally, primary branching of mustard and chick pea was improved by 7.4 and 19.84%, respectively in the treated sample as compared to the control. The control mustard and chick pea crops showed high rate of infection by pests and diseases, while treated crops were free from any infection of pests and disease. The yield attributing characters of mustard showed, lucidly higher numbers of siliquae on main shoot, siliquae/plant and siliquae length were observed in the treated seeds and plot as compared with the control. Moreover, similar results were observed in the yield attributing parameters of chick pea viz. pods/plant, grains/pod as well as test weight of 1000 grains. The seed and stover yield of mustard in treated plots were increased by 61.5% and 25.4%, respectively with respect to the control. However, grain/seed yield of mustard crop after biofield energy treatment was increased by 500% in terms of kg per meter square as compared to the control. Besides, grain/seed yield of chick pea crop after biofield energy treatment was increased by 500% in terms of kg per meter square. The harvest index of biofield treated mustard was increased by 21.83%, while it was slight increased in case of chick pea. In conclusion, the biofield energy treatment could be used on both the seeds and plots of mustard and chick pea as an alternative way to increase the production and yield.",['sdv']
Evaluation of Vegetative Growth Parameters in Biofield Treated Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus),"The objective of the study was to assess the growth contributing characters of biofield treated bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) seeds. The seeds of both crops were divided into two groups, one was kept aside and denoted as untreated, while the other group was subjected biofield energy treatment. The variabilities in growth contributing parameters were studied and compared with their control. Further the level of glutathione (GSH) in okra leaves, along with DNA fingerprinting in bottle gourd were analyzed using RAPD method. After germination, the plants of bottle gourd were reported to be strong and erect with better canopy as compared with the control. The vegetative growth of okra plants after biofield energy treatment was found to be stout with small canopy, strong steam, and more fruits per nodes, that contributed high yield as compared with the control. However, endogenous level of GSH in the leaves of okra was increased by 47.65% as compared to the untreated group, which may suggest an improved immunity of okra crops. Besides, the DNA fingerprinting data, showed polymorphism (42%) between treated and untreated samples of bottle gourd. The overall results suggest that the biofield energy treatment on bottle gourd and okra seeds, results an improved overall growth of plant and yield, which may enhance flowering and fruiting per plant. Study results conclude that the biofield energy treatment could be an alternate method to improve the crop yield in agricultural science.",['sdv']

"Pirates : brigands, entrepreneurs… ou libertaires ? Conférence grand public (Fondation Université de Limoges), Limoges, BFM","La mer est un espace liquide sans frontières, très tôt régi par des règles coutumières. Les premiers Grecs étaient tous pirates (Montesquieu) ; pirata minus delinquit, quia in mari delinquit : les délits des pirates sont considérés comme mineurs parce que commis en mer (Alciat). En effet, pour les cités sur le pourtour de la Méditerranée, la piraterie s’impose comme une puissance commerciale, voire militaire. À l’aube des temps modernes, elle s’étend de plus en plus aux océans, ce nouvel espace sans loi à conquérir. Et les brigands des mers, les pirates et les corsaires, y agissent sans scrupules. À l’instar de Jean Bart, ces derniers sont désormais des alliés précieux pour les rois en Europe, car ils affaiblissent l’adversaire et contribuent au ravitaillement des troupes régulières. Avec l’avènement de la bourgeoisie, la littérature redécouvre l’espace hors-la-loi où l’individu peut encore s’affirmer par des actions héroïques.

"Quantitative Determination of Isotopic Abundance Ratio of 13C, 2H, and 18O in Biofield Energy Treated Ortho and Meta Toluic Acid Isomers","O-Toluic acid (OTA) and m-toluic acid (MTA) are two isomers of toluic acid that act as an important organic intermediates, mostly used in medicines and pesticides. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on isotopic abundance ratios of 2H/1H, 13C/12C, (PM+1)/PM and 18O/16O, (PM+2)/PM, in toluic acid isomers using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The OTA and MTA samples were divided into two parts: control and treated. The control sample remained as untreated, while the treated sample was further divided into four groups as T1, T2, T3, and T4. The treated group was subjected to biofield energy treatment. The GC-MS spectra of both the isomers showed five m/z peaks due to the molecular ion peak and fragmented peaks of toluic acid derivatives. The isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1)/PM and (PM+2)/PM were calculated for both the isomers and found significant alteration in the treated isomers. The isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1)/PM in treated samples of OTA was decreased and then slightly increased upto 2.37% in T2, where the (PM+2)/PM in treated OTA, significantly decreased by 55.3% in T3 sample. Similarly, in case of MTA, the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1)/PM in the treated sample showed a slight increase the (PM+2)/PM was decreased by 11.95% in T2 as compared to their respective control. GC-MS data suggests that the biofield energy treatment on toluic acid isomers had significantly altered the isotopic abundance of 2H, 13C, and 18O in OTA and MTA as compared to the control.",['chim']
"Morphological Characterization, Quality, Yield and DNA Fingerprinting of Biofield Energy Treated Alphonso Mango (Mangifera indica L.)","Alphonso is the most delicious variety of mango (Mangifera indica L.) known for its excellent texture, taste, and richness with vitamins and minerals. The present study was attempted to evaluate the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on morphological characteristics, quality, yield and molecular assessment of mango. A plot of 16 acres lands used for this study with already grown mango trees. This plot was divided into two parts. One part was considered as control, while another part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment without physically touching and referred as treated. The treated mango trees showed new straight leaves, without any distortion and infection, whereas the control trees showed very few, distorted, infected, and curly leaves. Moreover, the flowering pattern of control trees did not alter; it was on average 8 to 10 inches with more male flowers. However, the flowering pattern of treated trees was completely transformed into compact one being 4 to 5 inches in length and having more female flowers. Additionally, the weight of matured ripened mango was found on an average 275 gm, medium sized with 50% lesser pulp in the control fruits, while the fruits of biofield energy treated trees showed on average weight of 400 gm, large sized and having 75% higher pulp as compared to the control. Apart from morphology, the quality and nutritional components of mango fruits such as acidity content was increased by 65.63% in the treated sample. Vitamin C content in the treated Alphonso mango pulp was 43.75% higher than the pulp obtained from the control mango farm. The spongy tissue content in pulp of the matured ripened mangoes was decreased by 100% for two consecutive years as compared to the control. Moreover, the yield of flowers and fruits in the treated trees were increased about 95.45 and 47.37%, respectively as compared to the control. Besides, the DNA fingerprinting data using RAPD revealed that the treated sample did not show any true polymorphism as compared to the control. The overall results envisaged that the biofield energy treatment on the mango trees showed a significant improvement in the morphology, quality and overall productivity along with 100% reduction in the spongy tissue disorder. In conclusion, the biofield energy treatment could be used as an alternative way to increase the production of quality mangoes.",['sdv']
Measurement of Mechanical Properties and Microstructure of Cu-Ni-Cr Spinodal Alloy,The objective of the present examination is to learn the microstructure of copper-nickel-chromium spinodal alloy and its outcome on mechanical properties. A commercially important Cu-28.9%Ni-2.8%Cr alloy has been heat treated to create spinodal structures. Optical and transmission electron microscopic revision have been carried to learn the spinodally decomposed product and to compute the wavelengths in the sampling. The lattice imaging system of high-resolution electron microscopy is useful to investigate the compositional fluctuations in this alloy. Homogenized and solution treated samples were aged at various temperatures for unlike phase of time. The correlation of mechanical properties with microstructure then demonstrates a dependence of yield stress growth on lattice parameter change between the two phases.,['spi']
"Influence of Biofield Treatment on Physical, Structural and Spectral Properties of Boron Nitride","Boron nitride (BN) is known for high hardness, thermal stability, thermal conductivity, and catalytic action. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of biofield treatment on physical, structural and spectral properties of BN powder. The control and treated sample of BN powder were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).

"Biofield Energy Signals, Energy Transmission and Neutrinos","There has been significant data published in peer-reviewed scientific journals about Mr. Mahendra Kumar Trivedi exercising the biofield energy to change the behaviour and characteristics of living organisms including soil, seeds, plants, trees, animals, microbes, and humans, along with non-living materials including metals, ceramics, polymers, chemicals, pharmaceutical compounds and nutraceuticals, etc. This effect of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy on living beings and non-living materials is referred to as The Trivedi Effect®. The changes are attributed to changes at the atomic level and the subatomic level. Changes in atomic/molecular weights are postulated to the changes in atomic mass and atomic charge through possible mediation of neutrinos. The recent discovery of neutrino oscillations seems to give credence to our postulates. This paper discusses briefly about the neutrinos and some of Mr. Trivedi’s results and attempts to link these to biofield energy and associated signal transmissions.",['phys']

An Impact of Biofield Treatment on Spectroscopic Characterization of Pharmaceutical Compounds,"The stability of any pharmaceutical compound is most desired quality that determines its shelf life and effectiveness. The stability can be correlated to structural and bonding properties of compound and any variation arise in these properties can be easily determined by spectroscopic analysis. The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on these properties of four pharmaceutical compounds such as urea, thiourea, sodium carbonate, and magnesium sulphate, using spectroscopic analysis. Each compound was divided into two groups, referred as control and treatment. The control groups remained as untreated and treatment group of each compound received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Control and treated samples of each compound were characterized using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. FT-IR spectra of biofield treated urea showed the shifting of C=O stretching peak towards lower frequency (1684→1669 cm-1) and N-H stretching peak towards higher frequency (3428→3435 cm-1) with respect to control. A shift in frequency of C-N-H bending peak was also observed in treated sample as compared to control i.e. (1624→1647 cm-1). FT-IR spectra of thiourea showed upstream shifting of NH2 stretching peak (3363→3387 cm-1) as compared to control, which may be due to decrease in N-H bond length. Also, the change in frequency of N-C-S bending peak (621→660 cm-1) was observed in treated thiourea that could be due to some changes in bond angle after biofield treatment. Similarly, treated sample of sodium carbonate showed decrease in frequency of C-O bending peak (701→690 cm-1) and magnesium sulphate showed increase in frequency of S-O bending peak (621→647 cm-1) as compared to control, which indicated that bond angle might be altered after biofield treatment on respective samples. UV-Vis spectra of biofield treated urea showed shift in lambda max (λmax) towards higher wavelength (201→220 nm) as compared to control sample, whereas other compounds i.e. thiourea, sodium carbonate, and magnesium sulphate showed the similar λmax to their respective control. These findings conclude that biofield treatment has significant impact on spectral properties of tested pharmaceutical compounds which might be due to some changes happening at atomic level of compounds, and leading to affect the bonding and structural properties of compounds.",['sdv']
Effect of Biofield Treatment on Spectral Properties of Paracetamol and Piroxicam,"Paracetamol and piroxicam are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), widely used in pain and inflammatory diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on spectral properties of paracetamol and piroxicam. The study was performed in two groups (control and treatment) of each drug. The control groups remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treatment groups. Subsequently, spectral properties of both drugs before and after biofield treatment were characterized using FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopic techniques. FT-IR data of paracetamol showed N-H amide II bending peak in biofield treated paracetamol, which was shifted to lower wavenumber (1565 to 1555 cm-1) as compared to control. Further, the intensity of vibrational peaks in the range of 1171-965 cm-1 (C-O and C-N stretching) were increased in treated sample of paracetamol as compared to control. Similarly, the FT-IR data of piroxicam (treated) showed increased intensity of vibrational peaks at 1628 (amide C=O stretching), 1576-1560 cm-1 (C=C stretching) with respect to control peaks. Furthermore, vibrational peak of C=N stretching (1467 cm-1) was observed in biofield treated piroxicam. This peak was not observed in control sample, possibly due to its low intensity. Based on FT-IR data, it is speculated that bond length and dipole moment of some bonds like N-H (amide), C-O, and C-N in paracetamol and C=O (amide), C=N, and C=C in piroxicam might be changed due to biofield treatment. The UV spectrum of biofield treated paracetamol showed the shifting in wavelength of UV absorption as 243→248.2 nm and 200→203.4 nm as compared to control. Likely, the lambda max (λmax) of treated piroxicam was also shifted as 328 →345.6 nm, 241→252.2 nm, and 205.2→203.2 nm as compared to control. Overall results showed an impact of biofield treatment on the spectral properties of paracetamol and piroxicam.",['sdv']
Methodological Guide on Sources in AtoM,"This Archival Research Guide (ARG) aims to provide the user with a broad overview of the Archival Directory, a key component of the CENDARI Virtual Research Environment. The CENDARI Archival Directory consists of all available data in the AtoM application (“Access to Memory”) and data in the main repository, which is derived from international or national aggregators as well as national archives or other data providers. All data, whether manually inputted via the AtoM application or collected from institutions, form together the Archival Directory. In this guide the term “Archival Directory” refers only to the application AtoM and it hence will be used in this narrow sense. The term “Archival Directory AtoM” reinforces this definition. Unlike most of the other ARGs in CENDARI, this is not a thematic overview of a historical subject but instead a practical guide to the Archival Directory AtoM’s aims and how it was created and organised. This guide will present the methodology used by researchers associated with the CENDARI project when creating archival description and archival institution entries in CENDARI. It explains how material was selected to be entered into the Archival Directory AtoM, which institutions were considered as ‘hidden archives’ by the CENDARI team, what material was not included, the limitations of the project and the future of the Archival Directory AtoM.

Women During the First World War,"This Archival Research Guide is dedicated to different forms of women’s participation in the war effort and associationism during the First World War: these two strands include active participation of women in battles; war relief associations, peace movements and women’s employment in the war industry. Contemporary historiography has recognized the crucial role that women played in sustaining the war effort by replacing the labour of men who were engaged on the front. On the other hand, the role of women was crucial in those years for a variety of reasons and occupations: in fact, their commitment to organize in soldier’s relief and peace associations represents an important part of the historiography of the WW1. Moreover, the First World War was the first major belligerent event in which women could wear a military uniform: while this didn’t happen in every country, it was probably a first step toward the inclusion of women in sectors which once were exclusively occupied by men.",['shs']

In the present study, we assessed the effect of biofield treatment on phenotyping and genotyping characteristic of S. sonnei (ATCC 9290). The lyophilized samples of S. sonnei were divided in three groups (G): G-I (control, revived), G-II (treatment, revived), and G-III (treatment, lyophilized). All these groups (control and biofield treated) were analyzed against antimicrobial susceptibility, biochemical reactions, and biotype number. The 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to establish the phylogenetic relationship of S. sonnei with different bacterial species. The treated cells of S. sonnei exhibited an alteration of 3.33%, 10%, and 23.33% of total 30 tested antimicrobials in susceptibility assay for G-II on day 5 and 10 and G-III on day 10, respectively as compared to control. The treated cells of S. sonnei showed a significant change of about 12.12%, 12.12%, and 57.58% biochemical reactions out of 33 tests in treated groups of G-II on day 5 and 10 and G-III on day 10, respectively. The biotype number was also changed in treated samples of S. sonnei. Based on nucleotide homology sequences and phylogenetic analysis, the nearest homolog species of S. sonnei (GenBank Accession Number: EU009190) was identified as Shigella flexneri (EF643608). These results revealed that biofield treatment can prevent the absolute resistance in microbe against the existing antimicrobials.",['sdv']
Bio-field Treatment: A Potential Strategy for Modification of Physical and Thermal Properties of Gluten Hydrolysate and Ipomoea Macroelements,"The objective of present study was to study the effect of biofield treatment on physical and thermal properties of gluten hydrolysate (GH) and ipomoea macroelements (IM). The study was performed in two groups (control and treated). The control group remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treated group. The control and treated GH and IM were characterized by particle size analysis, surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Particle size results of treated GH showed that d50 (average particle size) was decreased by 3.15% and d99 (size exhibited by 99% of powder particles) by 18.40% as compared to control GH sample. The treated IM also showed substantial reduction in average particle size d50 by 4.70% and d99 by 44.40% as compared to control sample. BET analysis showed significant increase in surface area of treated GH by 374.40 % as compared to control sample. However, the treated IM showed reduction in surface area by 14.30% as compared to control sample. XRD data suggested that both control and treated GH samples were amorphous in nature. Contrarily, the treated IM sample showed intense crystalline nature; though minimal decrease was observed in crystallinity as compared to control. DSC data showed increase in melting temperature of the treated GH as compared to control which can be correlated to alteration in kinetic energy of sample. Additionally, the DSC of treated IM also showed increase in melting temperature as compared to control IM. A significant increase in latent heat of fusion (∆H) was observed in treated GH by 302.55% with respect to control. Similarly, the treated IM showed 24.87% increase in latent heat of fusion as compared to control. TGA data showed higher thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) of treated GH as compared to control. However, treated IM showed that Tmax was decreased as compared to control sample. These results suggested that biofield treatment has substantially changed the physical and thermal properties of the treated organic products (GH and IM).",['sdv']

Characterization of Physical and Thermal Properties of Biofield Treated Neopentyl Glycol,"Neopentyl glycol (NPG) has been extensively used as solid-solid phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage applications. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physical, spectral and thermal properties of NPG. The study was performed in two groups (control and treated). The control group remained as untreated, and treatment group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. The control and treated NPG were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. XRD study revealed the decrease in crystallite size of treated NPG by 21.97% as compared to control sample. DSC studies showed slight change in melting temperature of treated NPG as compared to control sample. TGA analysis showed 55.66% weight loss in control NPG however, the treated sample showed reduction in weight loss (44.81%). Additionally, the maximum thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) of treated NPG (160.40°C) was minimally increased with respect to control sample (159.72°C). This can be inferred as good thermal stability of biofield treated NPG with respect to control. FT-IR spectroscopy showed no structural changes in treated NPG with respect to control sample. The overall results showed that biofield treatment has affected the physical and thermal properties of treated NPG. Moreover, good thermal stability of treated NPG showed that it could be used as phase change materials for thermal energy storage applications.",['chim']
Bio-field Treatment: An Effective Strategy to Improve the Quality of Beef Extract and Meat Infusion Powder,"The present research work investigated the influence of bio-field treatment on two common flavoring agents used in food industries namely beef extract powder (BEP) and meat infusion powder (MIP). The treated powders were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size analysis, surface area analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The FT-IR results showed disappearance of triglycerides peaks in both the treated powders as compared to control. XRD results corroborated the amorphous nature of both control and treated samples. The BEP showed enhanced average particle size (d50) and d99 (size exhibited by 99% of powder particles) by 5.7% and 16.1%, respectively as compared to control. Contrarily, the MIP showed a decreased particle size (d50; 0.4% and d99; 18.1%) as compared to control. It was assumed that enormous energy was stored in MIP after bio-field treatment that led to fracture into smaller particles. The surface area was increased in both the treated powders. DSC result showed significant increase in melting temperature, in BEP and MIP, which indicated the higher thermal stability of the samples. However, the specific heat capacity (∆H) was decreased in both samples, which was probably due to high energy state of the powders.",['sdv']

Characterization of Phenotype and Genotype of Biofield Treated Enterobacter aerogenes,"Enterobacter aerogenes (E. aerogenes) has been commonly described as a versatile opportunistic pathogen in hospital infections. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on E. aerogenes for its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. E. aerogenes bearing ATCC 13048 (American Type Culture Collection) was procured from Bangalore Genei, in sealed pack and divided into control and treated groups. Treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment and analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), biochemical reactions, and biotype using automated MicroScan Walk-Away® system. In addition, treated group of E. aerogenes was evaluated for DNA polymorphism by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and 16S rDNA sequencing to establish the phylogenetic relationship of E. aerogenes with different closely related bacterial species. Antimicrobial susceptibility results showed an alteration of 14.28% among twenty-eight tested antimicrobials. Similarly, 15.65% tested antimicrobials showed an alteration in MIC values. Chloramphenicol showed improved sensitivity i.e. resistant to susceptible after biofield treatment, with the support of decreased MIC by two folds (i.e. >16 to ≤8 µg/mL). Norfloxacin also showed decrease MIC by two folds (i.e. 8 to ≤4 µg/mL) as compared to control. Biofield treatment showed an impact on biochemical reactions (9.09%) followed by a change in biotype number (7770 5272) in treated group with respect to control (7770 5372). Using RAPD analysis, sample showed an average range of 4 to 42% of polymorphism, while 16S rDNA study showed that treated sample was detected as Kluyvera cryocrescens (GenBank Accession Number: AM184245) with 97% identity of gene sequencing data, which was nearest homolog species to Enterobacter aerogenes strain: C1111 (Accession No. AB244467).

"New palladium metallacycles containing 4(N,N′)-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde-4(N)-thiosemicarbazones: Synthesis, spectral, structural and DNA/protein binding studies","The versatile coordination behavior of 4(N, N')-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde-4(N)-substituted thiosemicarbazones (H2L1-4) was examined in 1 : 1 stoichiometric reactions with [PdCl2(AsPh3)(2)]. All the new complexes (1-4) were characterized by analytical, IR, absorption and H-1 NMR spectroscopic studies. The complexes [Pd(DeaSal-tsc)(AsPh3)] (1), [Pd(H-DeaSal-mtsc)(AsPh3)] (2) and [Pd(H-DeaSal-etsc)(AsPh3)] (3) were structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Crystallographic results showed that the ligand H2L1 is coordinated as mono negative tridentate ONS donor ligand in the complex 1 by forming six and five member rings. Whereas, the ligands H2L2 and H2L3 bound to palladium in 2 and 3 as mono negative bidentate NS donor by forming a five member chelate ring by leaving the third potential donor atom, phenolic oxygen remain intact without being participated in bonding. The non-participation of the phenolic oxygen may be due to the intra molecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic hydrogen and N2 nitrogen. The interaction of the palladium(II) precursor [PdCl2(AsPh3)(2)], ligands ((H2L1-H2L4)) and their corresponding complexes (1-4) with calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. Based on the observations, an intercalative binding mode of DNA has been proposed. The protein binding abilities of the new complexes along with their precursor were monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues using BSA as model protein. From the studies, it was found that the new palladium metallacycles exhibited better affinity than their precursors.",['chim']

The Potential Impact of Biofield Treatment on Human Brain Tumor Cells: A Time-Lapse Video Microscopy,"Study background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common subtype of primary brain tumor in adults. The aim was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment potential on human GBM and non-GBM brain cells using two time-lapse video microscopy technique. Methods: The human brain tumor, GBM cultured cells were divided into two groups viz. GBM control and GBM treatment. Similarly, human normal brain cultured cells (non-GBM) were taken and divided into two groups viz. non-GBM control and non-GBM treatment. The GBM and non-GBM treatment groups were given Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment for the assessment of its potential. Two time-lapse (10 hours prior; 10 hours after) video microscopy experiment was performed on tumor and non-tumor brain cells in six replicate (n=6). For each microscopic field, the total cell number was counted and each cell was tracked over the 20 hours period. The potential impact of biofield treatment was assessed by comparing cell death rate in both GBM and non-GBM cells before and after biofield treatment. Results: GBM control cells showed a basal level of cell death 10 hours prior and 10 hours after the biofield treatment, and the rate remained unchanged over the 20 hours period, while in treatment group of GBM, cell death rate was exponentially increased (41%) after biofield treatment as compared to control. The treated non-GBM cultured cells showed a significant reduction (64%) of cell death rate i.e. protective effects as compared to non-GBM control. Conclusion: Altogether, data suggests that biofield treatment has significantly increased the cell death rate of treated GBM cells and simultaneously boost the viability of normal brain cells. Therefore, biofield treatment could be a suitable alternate treatment strategy for cancer patients in near future.",['sdv']

The herbomineral formulation was divided into two parts; one was represented as control, while the other part was treated with the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely by eighteen renowned Biofield Energy Healers (The Trivedi Effect®) and defined as the Biofield Treated formulation. The effect of the test formulation on these cells were monitored by an estimation of pro-inflammatory cytokines level such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1α), and interleukin (IL-1β) in cell culture supernatants at the non-cytotoxic concentrations of the test formulation using MTT assay. The DCs were treated with the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation at different concentrations (i.e. 1.05 to 1052.5 µg/mL) for 24 hours, and the results showed significant (p≤0.001) suppression of TNF-α levels at all the tested concentrations with a maximum percentage decrease by 43.64% at 5.2 µg/mL concentration in the Biofield Treated formulation as compared with the untreated test formulation. Further, the Biofield Treated formulation also demonstrated inhibition of MIP-1α and IL-1β at a concentration range of 0.0000105 to 10.5 µg/mL in LPS stimulated splenocyte cells. There was a significant (p≤0.001) inhibition of MIP-1α (26.52%) and IL-1β (35.28%) in the Biofield Treated test formulation at concentration 0.000105 µg/mL and 0.0000105 µg/mL, respectively in comparison to the untreated test formulation. Overall, these results suggest that the Biofield Energy Healing based herbomineral formulation (The Trivedi Effect®) significantly down-regulated the tested cytokines expression in DCs and splenocyte cells as compared to the untreated formulation. Therefore, the Biofield Healing based formulation might be useful as a better anti-inflammatory product for many chronic and acute inflammatory disease conditions and autoimmune disorders. The Biofield Energy Treatment based formulation can also be effectively applied in cases of organ transplants, stress management and anti-aging by improving overall health.",['sdv']
An Impact of the Trivedi Effect® - Biofield Energy Healing on Herbomineral Formulation for Immunomodulation of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines in Biofield Treated Mouse Splenocytes,"Herbomineral formulations have increased in recognition and popularity due to their high safety and better therapeutic action. A new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated with a mixture of the herbal root extract of ashwagandha and three minerals viz. zinc, magnesium, and selenium. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of Biofield Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) on the test formulation when applied to splenocyte cells isolated from the Biofield Treated mice. The test formulation was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control without any Biofield Energy Treatment. The other part was defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely by seven renowned Biofield Energy Healers. A wide concentration range (0.00001053 to 10.53 µg/mL) of the test formulation was used to determine non-cytotoxic concentrations using MTT assay. Further, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-1β) was determined by ELISA method. The test formulation was evaluated and found to be safe up to 1.053 µg/mL with a percentage cell viability range of 73% to 97% using MTT assay. The Biofield Treated formulation improved the cell viability up to 6.61% compared with the untreated test formulation. TNF-α expression was significantly inhibited by 16.72% at 0.1053 µg/mL compared with the untreated test formulation, however expression was significantly altered by 53.67% and 25.62% at 0.01053 and 1.053 µg/mL, respectively compared to the untreated test formulation. TNF-α expression was also suppressed in the Biofield Treated test formulation at 0.001053 and 0.1053 µg/mL by 4.0% and 8.56%, respectively as compared with the vehicle control. MIP-1α suppression was reported in the Biofield Treated test formulation at 0.00001053 to 1.053 µg/mL by 8.43%, 22.02%, 21.92%, 20.54%, 5.40%, and 19.82%, respectively compared with the vehicle control. However, the Biofield Treated formulation further exhibited substantial suppression of MIP-1α at 0.0001053, 0.001053, 0.01053, and 0.1053 µg/mL by 13.50%, 7.38%, 36.83% (p≤0.001), and 2.53%, respectively compared with the untreated test formulation. In addition, significant inhibition of IL-1β secretion was reported in the Biofield Treated formulation at 0.0001053, 0.001053, 0.01053, and 0.01053 µg/mL by 32.40%, 14.99%, 60.42%, and 15.15%, respectively compared with the untreated test formulation. The Biofield Energy Healing Treatment significantly potentiated the immunosuppressive effect of the test formulation in Biofield Treated mouse splenocytes, which can be used for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, stress management and anti-aging by improving overall health.",['sdv']
Les branchés du portable,"Partout, où que l’on aille, dans les rues, les gares, les cafés, les lieux publics, il est désormais impossible d’échapper à « l’envol » des utilisateurs du téléphone portable. Physiquement présents mais branchés ailleurs, ils font l’expérience d’un espace sans distance et d’un temps sans délais. Cette nouvelle capacité, qui paraîtra sans doute naturelle aux générations futures, est ici, pour la première fois, finement décrite et analysée par Francis Jauréguiberry. S’appuyant sur une recherche de plusieurs années et illustrant ses observations de témoignages dans lesquelles beaucoup se reconnaîtront, il explique le fantastique succès du portable par la possibilité que celui-ci offre de dépasser certains antagonismes vécus par l’individu contemporain : ouverture et recentrage, généralisation de l’urgence et volonté de rester maître de son temps, zapping occupationnel et désir de continuité. Ainsi, le portable permet-il de densifier le temps, de multiplier les opportunités, de coordonner les occupations, et à la fois de restaurer du lien là où la distance, l’éparpillement et l’anonymat le suppriment. Mais il ne faut pas en déduire un quelconque effet salvateur de la technologie sur le social. Car si le portable peut relier en liberté, il peut aussi lier en dépendance, entraîner une disponibilité d’écoute permanente ou être transformé en outil de surveillance et de contrôle à distance. La question de d’apparition d’une nouvelle forme d’inégalité parmi les branchés est ainsi posée. D’un côté ceux qui ont le pouvoir de se débrancher, et de l’autre ceux qui ont le devoir de rester connectés.",['shs']
A Root of Trust for the Personal Cloud,"The Personal Cloud paradigm has recently emerged as a way to allow individuals to manage under their control the collection, usage and sharing of data in different contexts and for different types and sensitivities of data. While much research work is tackling the organisation and semantic exploitation of the user's workspace, far less attention has been paid to security issues. We promote a new approach, called Secure Personal Cloud, where the root of security is made of secure hardware and the access control policies are easily extracted from the personal cloud itself, with minimal user interaction. Our solution is based on the tight integration of a Personal Cloud platform (Cozy) with a trusted component (PlugDB).",['info']
Evaluation of the Impact of Biofield Treatment on Physical and Thermal Properties of Casein Enzyme Hydrolysate and Casein Yeast Peptone,"In the present study, the influence of biofield treatment on physical and thermal properties of Casein Enzyme Hydrolysate (CEH) and Casein Yeast Peptone (CYP) were investigated. The control and treated samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), particle size and surface area analysis. The FTIR results revealed that biofield treatment has caused reduction of amide group (amide-I and amide-II) stretching vibration peak that is associated with strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding in treated CEH as compared to control. However, no significant changes were observed in FTIR spectrum of treated CYP. The TGA analysis of treated CEH showed a substantial improvement in thermal stability which was confirmed by increase in maximum thermal decomposition temperature (217°C) as compared to control (209°C). Similarly, the treated CYP also showed enhanced thermal stability as compared to control. DSC showed increase in melting temperature of treated CYP as compared to control. However the melting peak was absent in DSC of treated CEH which was probably due to rigid chain of the protein. The surface area of treated CEH was increased by 83% as compared to control. However, a decrease (7.3%) in surface area was observed in treated CYP. The particle size analysis of treated CEH showed a significant increase in average particle size (d50) and d99 value (maximum particle size below which 99% of particles are present) as compared to control sample. Similarly, the treated CYP also showed a substantial increase in d50 and d99 values which was probably due to the agglomeration of the particles which led to formation of bigger microparticles. The result showed that the biofield treated CEH and CYP could be used as a matrix for pharmaceutical applications.",['sdv']

RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF POWER DISTRIBUTION NETWORK,"Modern society is highly dependent on the efficient operation of electric power systems and has developed in such a way that even a small interruption in electric power supply has a significant effect. The knowledge of the reliability of distribution networks and systems is an important consideration in the system planning and operations for development and improvements of power distribution systems. To achieve the target of minimum interruptions as possible to customers, utilities must strive to improve the reliability but at the same time reduce cost. It is a known fact that most of customer interruptions are caused by the failure in distribution system. This paper presents the analysis of different case studies of distribution systems using Electrical Transient and Analysis Program (ETAP) software.",['spi']

Physicochemical and Spectroscopic Characterization of Biofield Energy Treated p-Anisidine,"The p-anisidine is widely used as chemical intermediate in the production of various dyes, pigments, and pharmaceuticals. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of biofield energy treatment on the physicochemical and spectroscopic properties of p-anisidine. The study was performed after dividing the sample in two groups; one was remained as untreated and another was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. Afterward, both the control and treated samples of p-anisidine were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyzer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis-derivative thermogravimetry (TGA-DTG), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The XRD analysis showed the increase in unit cell volume from 683.81 → 690.18 × 10-24 cm3 and crystallite size from 83.84→84.62 nm in the treated sample with respect to the control. The surface area analysis exhibited the significant increase (25.44%) in the surface area of treated sample as compared to control. The DSC thermogram of control p-anisidine showed the latent heat of fusion and melting temperature and 146.78 J/g and 59.41°C, respectively, which were slightly increased to 148.89 J/g and 59.49°C, respectively after biofield treatment. The TGA analysis showed the onset temperature of thermal degradation at 134.68°C in the control sample that was increased to 150.02°C after biofield treatment. The result showed about 11.39% increase in onset temperature of thermal degradation of treated p-anisidine as compared to the control. Moreover, the Tmax (temperature at which maximum thermal degradation occurs) was also increased slightly from 165.99°C (control) to 168.10°C (treated). This indicated the high thermal stability of treated p-anisidine as compared to the control. However, the FT-IR and UV spectroscopic studies did not show any significant changes in the spectral properties of treated p-anisidine with respect to the control. All together, the XRD, surface area and thermal analysis suggest that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment has the impact on physical and thermal properties of the treated p-anisidine.",['chim']
Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI),"Since the 1980s, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique has been widely used to track the effective diffusion of water molecules, which is hindered by many obstacles (e.g., fibers or membranes), in the human brain in vivo. Because water molecules tend to diffuse slowly across white matter fibers and diffuse fast along such fibers, the use of dMRI to track water diffusion allows one to map the microstructure and organization of those white matter pathways (17). Quantitatively measuring the diffusion process is critical for a quantitative assessment of the integrity of anatomical connectivity in white matter and its association with brain functional connectivity. Its clinical applications include normal brain maturation and aging, cerebral ischemia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, metabolic disorders, and brain tumors, among many others. Although there are several nice review papers and monographies on dMRI (15, 5, 101, 81), this chapter was written for the readers who are interested in the theoretical underpinning of various mathematical and statistical methods associated with dMRI. Due to limitations of space, we are unable to cite all important papers in the dMRI literature.",['info']
"Experimental Investigation on Physical, Thermal and Spectroscopic Properties of 2-Chlorobenzonitrile: Impact of Biofield Treatment","2-chlorobenzonitrile (2-ClBN) is widely used in the manufacturing of azo dyes, pharmaceuticals, and as intermediate in various chemical reactions. The aim of present study was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties of 2-ClBN. 2-ClBN sample was divided into two groups that served as treated and control. The treated group received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Subsequently, the control and treated samples were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyser, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. XRD result showed a decrease in crystallite size in treated samples i.e. 4.88% in 2-ClBN along with the increase in peak intensity as compared to control. However, surface area analysis showed a decrease in surface area of 64.53% in treated 2-ClBN sample as compared to the control. Furthermore, DSC analysis results showed a significant increase in the latent heat of fusion (28.74%) and a slight increase in melting temperature (2.05%) in treated sample as compared to the control. Moreover, TGA/DTG studies showed that the control and treated 2-ClBN samples lost 61.05% and 46.15% of their weight, respectively. The FT-IR spectra did not show any significant change in treated 2-ClBN sample as compared to control. However, UV-Vis spectra showed an increase in the intensity of peak as compared to control sample. These findings suggest that biofield treatment has significantly altered the physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties of 2-ClBN, which could make them more useful as a chemical intermediate.",['chim']
Antibiogram of Biofield-Treated Shigella boydii: Global Burden of Infections,"Bacillary dysentery and acute gastroenteritis caused by infection of Shigella species are major public health burden in India and its neighboring countries. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance threatens to render current treatments ineffective. The current study was attempted to investigate the effect of biofield treatment on Shigella boydii (S. boydii) with respect of antimicrobial susceptibility assay, biochemical characteristics and biotyping. The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 9207) strain of S. boydii was used in this experiment. The study was conducted in revived and lyophilized state of S. boydii. Both revived (Group; Gr. II) and lyophilized (Gr. III) strain of S. boydii were subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Gr. II was assessed on day 5 and day 10, while Gr. III on day 10 with respect to control (Gr. I). Sensitivity pattern of amoxicillin/k-clavulanate was improved from intermediate (I) to susceptible (S) with correspond to MIC value was also reduced by two folds (16/8 to ≤ 8/4 µg/mL) in both the treated groups as compared to control. The antimicrobial susceptibility of S. boydii showed 15% alteration in Gr. II on day 5, while significant (40%) alteration was found on day 10 as compared to control. The MIC values of antimicrobials for S. boydii also showed 12.50% alteration in Gr. II on day 5 while, significant alteration (59.38%) of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value was found in Gr. II on day 10 as compared to control. It was observed that overall 69.70% biochemical reactions were changed in which 66.67% alteration was found in Gr. II on day 10 with respect to control. Moreover, biotype numbers were changed in all the treated groups without alteration of organism as compared to control. These results suggested that biofield treatment had significant impact on S. boydii in Gr. II on day 10 with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility, MIC and biochemical reactions pattern.",['sdv']
Phenotyping and Genotyping Characterization of Proteus vulgaris After Biofield Treatment,"Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris) is widespread in nature, mainly found in flora of human gastrointestinal tract. The current study was attempted to investigate the effects of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment on lyophilized as well as revived state of P. vulgaris for antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, biochemical characteristics, and biotype. P. vulgaris cells were procured from Micro BioLogics Inc., USA, in sealed pack bearing the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 33420) number and stored according to the recommended storage protocol until needed for experiments. Lyophilized vial of ATCC strain of P. vulgaris were divided in two parts, Gr. I: control and Gr. II: treatment. Group II was further subdivided into two parts, Gr. IIA and Gr. IIB. Gr. IIA was analysed on day 10. Gr. IIB was stored and analysed on day 143. After retreatment on day 143, the sample was divided into three separate tubes. First, second and third tubes were analysed on day 5, 10 and 15 respectively. All experimental parameters were studied using automated Micro Scan Walk-Away® system. The 16S rDNA sequencing of lyophilized treated sample was carried out to correlate the phylogenetic relationship of P. vulgaris with other bacterial species after treatment. The antimicrobial susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration showed 10.71% and 15.63% alteration respectively in treated cells of P. vulgaris as compared to control. It was observed that few biochemical reactions (6%) were altered in the treated groups with respect to control. Moreover, biotype number was substantially changed in treated cells, Gr. IIA (62060406, Proteus penneri) on day 10 as compared to control (62070406; Proteus vulgaris). 16S rDNA analysis showed that the identified sample in this experiment was Proteus vulgaris after biofield treatment. However, the nearest homolog genus-species was found to be Proteus hauseri. The results suggested that biofield treatment has impact on P. vulgaris in lyophilized as well as revived state.",['sdv']
Physicochemical and Spectroscopic Characteristics of Biofield Treated p-Chlorobenzophenone,"p-Chlorobenzophenone (p-CBP) is the important chemical intermediate used for the synthesis of several pharmaceutical drugs like fenofibrate, cetirizine, alprazolam, and benzodiazepine. The aim of this study was set to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on physicochemical and spectroscopic properties of p-CBP. The study was accomplished in two groups i.e. control and treated. The treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. Subsequently, the control and treated samples of p-CBP were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size analyzer, surface area analyzer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis-derivative thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DTG), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.

"Characterization of Physical, Thermal and Spectroscopic Properties of Biofield Energy Treated P-Phenylenediamine and p-Toluidine","Aromatic amines and their derivatives are widely used in the production of dyes, cosmetics, medicines and polymers. However, they pose a threat to the environment due to their hazardous wastes as well as their carcinogenic properties. The objective of the study was to use an alternate strategy i.e. biofield energy treatment and analyse its impact on physicochemical properties of aromatic amine derivatives viz. p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and p-toluidine. For this study, both the samples were taken and divided into two parts. One part was considered as control and another part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. After treatment, both samples were analysed for their physical, thermal and spectral properties as compared to their respective control samples. The analysis was done by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyser, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The XRD studies and surface area analysis of PPD sample revealed that the crystallite size and surface area of the treated sample was increased by 11.12% and 8.49%, respectively as compared to the control sample. In case of p-toluidine, the crystallite size and surface area of treated sample were decreased by 4.8% and 8.43%, respectively as compared to control. The treated PPD sample also showed an alteration in thermal degradation properties as it exhibited two-steps thermal decomposition as compared to single step decomposition in the control sample. In case of p-toluidine, the treated sample showed decreased onset temperature of degradation (112°C→100°C) and Tmax (temperature at which maximum weight loss occur) (136°C→125°C) as compared to control sample. Moreover, the FT-IR analysis revealed that C-C aromatic stretching peak in treated PPD sample was shifted to the lower frequency (1456→1444 cm-1) as compared to the control sample. Besides, in p-toluidine, the treated sample showed the alteration in frequencies of C-N-H bending, C-H bending, C-H stretching, and C-C aromatic stretching and bending peaks as compared to the control sample. However, no alteration was found in UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis of treated PPD and p-toluidine samples as compared to their respective control samples. These findings suggest that the biofield treatment significantly altered the physical, thermal and IR spectroscopic properties of PPD and p-toluidine samples.",['chim']

Manifeste animaliste. Politiser la cause animale,"Soulignant ce qui est en jeu dans la violence envers les animaux, C. Pelluchon montre que la cause animale est la cause de l'humanité. Lutter contre la maltraitance animale, c'est prendre la mesure des dysfonctionnements d'une société fondée sur l'exploitation illimitée des autres vivants et désirer promouvoir plus de justice envers eux. Aussi la question animale est-elle une question politique majeure. Elle nous concerne tous, quels que soient nos positions idéologiques et les conflits d'intérêts qui nous divisent. Écrit dans un style vif, ce manifeste évite la stigmatisation et dépasse les compromis qui ne satisfont personne. La stratégie proposée consiste, à court terme, à aider les personnes travaillant dans l'élevage, l'expérimentation, l'alimentation et la mode, à se reconvertir et à innover. L'objectif, à plu slong terme, est de donner aux citoyens, aux représentants politiques et aux différents acteurs de l'économie les moyens d'opérer la transition vers une société plus juste prenant en compte les intérêts des humains et ceux des animaux.",['shs']

Forcible Removals: the Case of Australian Aboriginal and Native American ChildrenLes retraits forcés: Le cas des enfants aborigènes d'Australie et des enfants autochtones d'Amérique du Nord,"This article analyses the way Australian and United States of America (USA) governments used the notion of the best interest of the child to remove Aboriginal and Native children respectively from their families and communities. Both governments relied on legal means to achieve the assimilation of children within the mainstream culture in order to annihilate Aboriginal and Native culture. On the one hand, the children were targeted because of their malleability and capacity for adaptation without influencing the mainstream culture. On the other hand, the chance of survival for their community was very thin without them. With regard to Australia, the process began as early as when the first settlements were established as Aboriginal women and children were kidnapped for economic and sexual exploitation. The protectorate system was thus established in the 1830s to assure their protection on reserved lands administered by a Chief Protector. In the case of the Native Americans, the assimilation policies were carried out with the boarding school system and the placements in white adoptive and foster homes. Both governments had shown the limit of their role as parens patriae when ethnic issues were at stake.",['shs']

Permanent deformation of wooden panel paintings: what is the contribution of residual drying stresses ?,"This paper analyses the possible effect of residual drying stresses on the permanent deformation of panel paintings. For this purpose, experiments were done, during which samples were submitted to several adsorption–desorption cycles to reproduce what could happen in real climatic conditions. The painted side is regarded in this work as a sealed surface that is mimicked by insulated some faces of the sample with an aluminium sheet. The asymmetry of the moisture content profile generates a global curving of the sample section that is followed over time. Results show that humidity variations in the surrounding, because acting on one single face, reduce the residual drying stress by activating the mechano-sorptive creep. This effect gives rise to a concave cupping towards the non-painted face. This deformation does not disappear as the moisture content becomes uniform across the panel.",['spi']

Antibiogram Typing and Biochemical Characterization of Klebsiella pneumoniae after Biofield Treatment,"Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is a common nosocomial pathogen causing respiratory tract (pneumoniae) and blood stream infections. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates of K. pneumoniae infections are difficult to treat in patients in health care settings. Aim of the present study was to determine the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment on four MDR clinical lab isolates (LS) of K. pneumoniae (LS 2, LS 6, LS 7, and LS 14). Samples were divided into two groups i.e. control and biofield treated. Control and treated groups were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), biochemical study and biotype number using MicroScan Walk-Away® system. The analysis was done on day 10 after biofield treatment as compared with control group. Antimicrobial sensitivity assay showed that there was 46.42% alteration in sensitivity of tested antimicrobials in treated group of MDR K. pneumonia isolates. MIC results showed an alteration in 30% of tested antimicrobials out of thirty after biofield treatment in clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae. An increase in antimicrobial sensitivity and decrease in MIC value was reported (in LS 6) in case of piperacillin/tazobactam and piperacillin. Biochemical study showed a 15.15% change in biochemical reactions as compared to control. A significant change in biotype numbers were reported in all four clinical isolates of MDR K. pneumoniae after biofield treatment as compared to control group. On the basis of changed biotype number after biofield treatment, new organism was identified as Enterobacter aerogenes in LS 2 and LS 14. These results suggest that biofield treatment has a significant effect on altering the antimicrobial sensitivity, MIC values, biochemical reactions and biotype number of multidrug-resistant isolates of K. pneumoniae.",['sdv']
Evaluation of Isotopic Abundance Ratio in Naphthalene Derivatives After Biofield Energy Treatment Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,"Naphthalene and 2-naphthol are two naphthalene derivatives, which play important roles in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance of 13C/12C or 2H/1H and 18O/16O in naphthalene and 2-naphthol using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Naphthalene and 2-naphthol samples were divided into two parts: control and treated. The control group remained as untreated, while the treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. The treated samples were subdivided into four parts named as T1, T2, T3 and T4. Control and treated samples were characterized using GC-MS. The GC-MS data revealed that the isotopic abundance ratio of 13C/12C or 2H/1H, (PM+1)/PM and 18O/16O, (PM+2)/PM were increased significantly in treated naphthalene and 2-naphthol (where PM-primary molecule, (PM+1) isotopic molecule either for 13C or 2H and (PM+2) is the isotopic molecule for 18O). The isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1)/PM in the treated T2 samples of naphthalene and 2-naphthol was increased up to 129.40% and 165.40%, respectively as compared to their respective control. However, the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1)/PM in the treated T1, T3 and T4 samples of naphthalene was decreased by 44.41%, 33.49% and 30.3%, respectively as compared to their respective control. While in case of 2-naphthol, the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1)/PM was decreased by 39.57% in T1 sample and then gradually increased up to 9.85% from T3 to T4 samples. The isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+2)/PM in treated T2 sample of 2-naphthol was increased up to 163.24%, whereas this value was decreased by 39.57% in treated T1 sample. The GC-MS data suggest that the biofield energy treatment has significantly altered the isotopic abundance of 2H, 13C in naphthalene and 2H, 13C and 18O in 2-naphthol as compared to the control.",['chim']

The objective of present research was to study the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment on physical and thermal properties of phenol derivatives such as o-nitrophenol (ONP), m-nitrophenol (MNP) and p-tertiary butyl phenol (TBP). The study was performed in two groups (control and treated). The control and treated compounds were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and surface area analysis. XRD analysis showed increase in crystallite size by 16.05% in treated ONP as compared to control. However, the treated MNP showed decrease in crystallite size by 16.17% as compared to control. The treated TBP showed increase in crystallite size by 5.20% as compared to control. DSC of treated MNP exhibited increase in melting temperature with respect to control, which may be correlated to higher thermal stability of treated sample. However, the treated TBP exhibited no significant change in melting temperature with respect to control. TGA analysis of treated ONP and TBP showed an increase in maximum thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) as compared to control. However, the treated MNP showed slight decrease in Tmax in comparison with control sample. Surface area analysis of treated ONP showed decrease in surface area by 65.5%. However, surface area was increased by 40.7% in treated MNP as compared to control.

The study was performed in two groups; the control group was remained as untreated, while the treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. Subsequently, the control and treated o-aminophenol samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), surface area analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and Ultra violet-visible spectroscopy analysis (UV-vis). The XRD analysis showed an increase in peak intensity of the treated o-aminophenol with respect to the control. Additionally, the crystallite size of the treated o-aminophenol was increased by 34.51% with respect to the control sample. DSC analysis showed a slight increase in the melting temperature of the treated sample as compared to the control. However, a significant increase in the latent heat of fusion was observed in the treated o-aminophenol by 162.24% with respect to the control. TGA analysis showed an increase in the maximum thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) in treated o-aminophenol (178.17ºC) with respect to the control (175ºC). It may be inferred that the thermal stability of o-aminophenol increased after the biofield treatment. The surface area analysis using BET showed a substantial decrease in the surface area of the treated sample by 47.1% as compared to the control. The FT-IR analysis showed no changes in the absorption peaks of the treated sample with respect to the control. UV-visible analysis showed alteration in the absorption peaks i.e. 211→203 nm and 271→244 nm of the treated o-aminophenol as compared to the control.

"Characterization of Biofield Energy Treated 3-Chloronitrobenzene: Physical, Thermal, and Spectroscopic Studies","The chloronitrobenzenes are widely used as the intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals, pesticides and rubber processing chemicals. However, due to their wide applications, they are frequently released into the environment thereby creating hazards. The objective of the study was to use an alternative strategy i.e. biofield energy treatment and analysed its impact on the physical, thermal and spectral properties of 3-chloronitrobenzene (3-CNB). For the study, the 3-CNB sample was taken and divided into two groups, named as control and treated. The analytical techniques used were X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Visible (UV-Vis), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The treated group was subjected to the biofield energy treatment and analysed using these techniques against the control sample. The XRD data showed an alteration in relative intensity of the peak along with 30% decrease in the crystallite size of the treated sample as compared to the control. The TGA studies revealed the decrease in onset temperature of degradation from 140ºC (control) to 120°C, while maximum thermal degradation temperature was changed from 157.61ºC (control) to 150.37ºC in the treated sample as compared to the control. Moreover, the DSC studies revealed the decrease in the melting temperature from 51°C (control) →47°C in the treated sample. Besides, the UV-Vis and FT-IR spectra of the treated sample did not show any significant alteration in terms of wavelength and frequencies of the peaks, respectively from the control sample.

"Kaninikula, Mathematics in the Trobriand Islands","String figure-making has been observed throughout the twentieth century in various societies, especially those of oral tradition. Such figures are produced from a loop of string using a series of operations performed with the fingers—and sometimes the teeth, the wrists or the feet. Eric Vandendriessche, an ethnomathematician, is currently carrying out research aiming to show that the creation of string figures can be analyzed in mathematical terms. He has carried out field studies among the Trobriand Islanders of Papua New Guinea, where the art of string figure-making—locally termed kaninikula— still survives today. In this film, an epistemological approach to the mathematical rationality underlying the making of string figures is juxtaposed with contemporary ethnographic research. This dual approach leads naturally to hypotheses concerning the way the Trobriand practitioners perceive this activity, and the cognitive acts that have underlain the creation of string figures in this part of the world.La pratique de ""jeux de ficelle"" a pu être observée tout au long du XXe siècle dans diverses sociétés, et tout particulièrement dans des sociétés de tradition orale. Cette activité consiste à appliquer à une boucle de ficelle une succession d ’ opérations effectuées avec les doigts, et parfois avec les dents ou les pieds, pour obtenir une figure. Eric Vandendriessche, ethnomathématicien, mène une recherche dont l ’ enjeu est de montrer que la création de ces figures de ficelle relève d ’ une pratique mathématique. Ses recherches le conduisent chez les Trobriandais de Papouasie Nouvelle-Guinée où les jeux de ficelle, appelés kaninikula, sont pratiqués aujourd ’ hui encore. Le film met en parallèle une réflexion épistémologique sur la rationalité mathématique manifestée dans les procédures de jeu de ficelle et une enquête ethnographique sur la pratique contemporaine des jeux de ficelle dans les îles Trobriand. Cette double approche permet de formuler des hypothèses sur la façon dont des praticiens trobriandais perçoivent cette activité, et sur les mécanismes cognitifs qui ont sous-tendu la création des figures de ficelle dans cette région du monde.",['shs']

GPS Multipath Detection in the Frequency Domain,"Multipath is among the major sources of errors in precise positioning using GPS and continues to be extensively studied. Two Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based detectors are presented in this paper as GPS multipath detection techniques. The detectors are formulated as binary hypothesis tests under the assumption that the multipath exists for a sufficient time frame that allows its detection based on the quadrature arm of the coherent Early-minus-Late discriminator (Q EmL) for a scalar tracking loop (STL) or on the quadrature (Q EmL) and/or in-phase arm (I EmL) for a vector tracking loop (VTL), using an observation window of N samples. Performance analysis of the suggested detectors is done on multipath signal data acquired from the multipath environment simulator developed by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) as well as on multipath data from real GPS signals. Application of the detection tests to correlator outputs of scalar and vector tracking loops shows that they may be used to exclude multipath contaminated satellites from the navigation solution. These detection techniques can be extended to other Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GLONASS, Galileo and Beidou.",['spi']
GPS Multipath Induced Errors for the Vector Tracking Loop: Insight into Multipath Detection,"Multipath is one of the most serious sources of error in the Global Positioning System (GPS). Multipath distorts the correlation function used for carrier phase and code delay measurements, and therefore induces errors in these measurements and consequently in the calculated positioning solution. This paper aims at characterizing multipath induced tracking errors for a vector tracking loop (VTL). The paper contributes to the characterization of tracking and positioning errors for VTLs by deriving models that allow the analysis of both code and carrier tracking errors with respect to multipath delay, multipath phase and multipath fading frequency. The paper further provides a simple multipath detection technique based on correlator outputs, showing another advantage of the VTL over the scalar tracking loop (STL).",['spi']
Simulation-Based Verification of Avionic Systems Deployed on IMA Architectures,"To build reliable avionic applications, we interconnect Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) architectures with Time-Triggered Ethernet (TT-Ethernet). These systems have direct impacts on human lives where the failure is unacceptable. Therefore, verification is an important issue to ensure the safety and the performance of the system. The integration of IMA architectures is a very complex and challenging engineering task. To cope with complexity and to perform verification, a model-based approach, which endows engineering teams with a methodology and an adequate tooling is of a paramount importance. To design IMA architectures interconnected with TT-Ethernet, we have proposed an extension of the AADL language in previous works. In this paper, we present a simulation-based verification of our extension and show how it can be simulated using a discrete event simulation environment called DEVS Suite. The main advantage of this technique is to perform cycle-accurate simulation of the complex avionics systems, which cannot be undertaken by model checking techniques.

Semi-Supervised Factored Logistic Regression for High-Dimensional Neuroimaging Data,"Imaging neuroscience links human behavior to aspects of brain biology in ever-increasing datasets. Existing neuroimaging methods typically perform either discovery of unknown neural structure or testing of neural structure associated with mental tasks. However, testing hypotheses on the neural correlates underlying larger sets of mental tasks necessitates adequate representations for the observations. We therefore propose to blend representation modelling and task classification into a unified statistical learning problem. A multinomial logistic regression is introduced that is constrained by factored coefficients and coupled with an au-toencoder. We show that this approach yields more accurate and interpretable neural models of psychological tasks in a reference dataset, as well as better generalization to other datasets.","['info', 'math', 'shs']"

Key properties of optical crossbars, namely a) contention-free data routing b) low-latency communication and c) potential for high bandwidth through the use of WDM, motivate several implementations. These implementations demonstrate very different scalability and power efficiency ability depending on three key design factors: a) the network topology, b) the considered layout and c) the insertion losses induced by the fabrication process. The emerging design technique relying on multi-layer deposited silicon allows reducing optical losses, which may lead to significant reduction of the power consumption. In this paper, multi-layer deposited silicon based crossbars are proposed and compared. The results indicate that the proposed ring-based network exhibits, on average, 22% and 51.4% improvement for worst-case and average losses respectively compared to the most power-efficient related crossbars.",['info']
Thermal Aware Design Method for VCSEL-Based On-Chip Optical Interconnect,"Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) is an emerging technology considered as one of the key solutions for future generation on-chip interconnects. However, silicon photonic devices in ONoC are highly sensitive to temperature variation, which leads to a lower efficiency of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs), a resonant wavelength shift of Microring Resonators (MR), and results in a lower Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a methodology enabling thermal-aware design for optical interconnects relying on CMOS-compatible VCSEL. Thermal simulations allow designing ONoC interfaces with low gradient temperature and analytical models allow evaluating the SNR.",['info']
A discrete approach for polygonal approximation of irregular noise contours,"Polygonal approximation is often involved in many applications of computer vision, image processing and data compression. In this context, we are interested in digital curves extracted from contours of objects contained in digital images. In particular, we propose a fully discrete structure, based on the notion of blurred segments, to study the geometrical features on such curves and apply it in a process of polygonal approximation. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method to local variation and noise on the curve.","['scco', 'info']"

Iron Complexes in Visible-Light-Sensitive Photoredox Catalysis: Effect of Ligands on Their Photoinitiation Efficiencies,"The novel role of metal-based complexes as photoinitiator catalysts fits well into the concept of green chemistry, as it realizes the activation of polymer synthesis processes by visible light that are abundant in the solar light and allows the marked reduction of photoinitiator amount in the systems. In the present paper, a series of iron complexes (FeC_x) with various ligands have been proposed as new photoinitiator catalysts to initiate the cationic polymerization of epoxides or the free radical polymerization of acrylates upon a near-UV or visible-light LED exposure. The ligands play an important role on the light absorption properties and the photoinitiation ability of the iron complexes. In combination with one or two additives, FeC_x are capable to efficiently generate radicals, cations, and radical cations through an oxidative or a reductive path. Two of the newly developed FeC_x-based photoinitiating systems exhibited comparable photoinitiation efficiency with the commercial Type I photoinitiator bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide (BAPO). Owing to the photocatalytic effect, remarkable photoinitiation efficiencies have been achieved by using very low concentration of iron complexes (0.02 wt %) in the systems. The involved photochemical mechanisms have been studied using electron spin resonance spin trapping, steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, and laser flash photolysis techniques",['chim']
"Panchromatic photoinitiators for radical, cationic and thiol-ene polymerization reactions: a search in the diketopyrrolopyrrole or indigo dye series","A series of diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives (DPPs) and indigo derivatives (IDGs) are synthesized and applied as photoinitiators (PIs) for the cationic polymerization (CP) of epoxides, the free radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylates or the thiol-ene polymerization under different lights (purple, blue, green, yellow, red LEDs and green laser diode). The photochemical mechanisms involved in the presence of these PIs and additives (iodonium salt (Iod), N-vinylcarbazole (NVK), amine (MDEA) or 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine (R-Cl)) are investigated by steady state photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, and laser flash photolysis techniques. Real-time infrared spectroscopy studies reveal that DPP4/Iod/NVK is very efficient for both CP and FRP and, compared to two references (Eosin-Y and camphorquinone), displays noticeably higher polymerization efficiencies. Panchromatic curable formulations exhibiting an almost constant photosensitivity from the blue to the red are proposed",['chim']
Photochemical in situ elaboration of polyoxometalate (α-[SiMo12O40]4-) / polymer hybrid materials,"α-Silicon polyoxomolybdates in combination with an iodonium salt and/or a silane are used to generate phenyl and/or silyl radicals as well as silylium cations upon UV light irradiation. These species can initiate the radical photopolymerization of acrylates, the cationic photopolymerization of epoxides and the photopolymerization of epoxy/acrylate blends (i.e. for the synthesis of interpenetrated polymer networks) thereby leading to the formation of polyoxometalate/polymer hybrid materials. The mechanical properties of e.g. the polyether films are affected by the presence of polyoxometalate in the matrix as shown by their dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The photochemical mechanisms are studied by steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, and electron spin resonance techniques.",['chim']

Do Scaphoideus titanus larvae aggregate for feeding ?,"The leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus is the harmful vector of the phytoplasma causing the Flavescence dorée, one of the current major threats in European viticulture. The ecology of this insect is however poorly known even if better understanding of this species’ life history traits and behavior will improve our ability to foresee the epidemiology of the disease. We investigated the aggregative behavior of the larvae. We conclude from different experiments that larval aggregation occurs at the plant scale, but we could not clarify the factors cueing such an aggregation. Also aggregative oviposition patterns may occur and reinforce such aggregation under young leaves. These aggregation patterns should be studied in more details in order to gain knowledge in the epidemiology of Flavescence dorée and eventually to develop control strategies based on inter-individual epideictic regulation.",['sdv']

Object Database Benchmarks,"The need for performance measurement tools appeared soon after the emergence of the first Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMSs), and proved important for both designers and users (Atkinson & Maier, 1990). Performance evaluation is useful to designers to determine elements of architecture and more generally to validate or refute hypotheses regarding the actual behavior of an OODBMS. Thus, performance evaluation is an essential component in the development process of well-designed and efficient systems. Users may also employ performance evaluation, either to compare the efficiency of different technologies before selecting an OODBMS or to tune a system. Performance evaluation by experimentation on a real system is generally referred to as benchmarking. It consists in performing a series of tests on a given OODBMS to estimate its performance in a given setting. Benchmarks are generally used to compare the global performance of OODBMSs, but they can also be exploited to illustrate the advantages of one system or another in a given situation, or to determine an optimal hardware configuration. Typically, a benchmark is constituted of two main elements: a workload model constituted of a database and a set of read and write operations to apply on this database, and a set of performance metrics.",['info']
Towards Qualitative Insights for Visualizing Student Engagement in Web-based Learning Environments,"Learning Sciences argue that student engagement is composed of behavioral, motivational and cognitive dimensions.

"Scientific opinion of flavouring group evaluation 407 (FGE.407): 4‐amino‐5‐(3‐(isopropylamino)‐2,2‐dimethyl‐3‐oxopropoxy)‐2‐methylquinoline‐3‐carboxylic acid","The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) was requested to deliver a scientific opinion on the implications for human health of the flavouring substance 4-amino-5-(3-(isopropylamino)-2,2-dimethyl-3-oxopropoxy)-2-methylquinoline-3-carboxylic acid [FL-no: 16.130], in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 407 (FGE. 407), according to Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The substance has not been reported to occur in natural source materials of botanical or animal origin. It is intended to be used as both the parent compound and its hemisulfate monohydrate salt as a flavouring substance with modifying properties in specific categories of food. The chronic dietary exposure to the substance estimated using the added portions exposure technique (APET), is calculated to be 882 mu g/person per day for a 60-kg adult and 547 [mu g/person per day for a 15-kg 3-year-old child. There is no concern with respect to genotoxicity. A 90-day dietary administration study in rats showed no adverse effects for doses up to 100 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day, providing an adequate margin of safety. Developmental toxicity was not observed in a study with rats at the dose levels up to 1,000 mg/kg bw per day. The Panel concluded that [FL-no: 16.130] and its hemisulfate monohydrate salt are not expected to be of safety concern at the estimated levels of dietary exposure calculated using the APET approach. This conclusion applies only to the use of the substance as a flavour modifier as requested and when used at the levels as specified for foods from different food categories.",['sdv']
Safety assessment of the substance ‘Tungsten Oxide’ for use in food contact materials,"This scientific opinion of EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the risk assessment of the additive tungsten oxide, CAS No 39318-18-8 and FCM No 1064, for use in food contact materials as a reheat agent in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at a maximum use level of 75 ppm (75 mg/kg PET). The substance is a mixture of tungsten oxides with tungsten at different oxidative levels. The average oxidation level of tungsten in the oxides is 2.86 corresponding to 19.93% oxygen content. Detailed information on impurities is provided as confidential. Specific migration from PET plaques with the substance at 150 mg/kg (double the maximum intended use level of 75 mg/kg) was determined into 95% ethanol, as a worst-case simulant for PET due to its swelling effect. Under these test conditions, the specific migration, measured as tungsten using ICP-MS, was at the level of 1 lg/kg. The Panel considered that due to the insolubility of the substance, this low migration will be typical for any foreseeable use as a reheat additive in PET. Two in vitro genotoxicity studies, a bacterial gene mutation test and an in vitro micronucleus assay, performed in accordance with the OECD Guidelines and in compliance with GLP, were provided by the applicant for the substance tungsten oxide and were considered negative by the CEF Panel. According to a scientific opinion on strategy for genotoxicity testing (EFSA, 2011), the three genotoxic endpoints, gene mutation, chromosomal and numerical aberrations, are covered by these two tests. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance tungsten oxide is not of safety concern for the consumer if the additive is used as a reheat agent in PET. For other technical functions or for use in other polymers, the migration should not exceed 50 lg/kg (expressed as tungsten).",['sdv']
Nonparametric Assessment of Hedge Fund Performance,"We propose a new class of performance measures for Hedge Fund (HF) returns based on a family of empirically identifiable stochastic discount factors (SDFs). The SDF-based measures incorporate no-arbitrage pricing restrictions and naturally embed information about higher-order mixed moments between HF and benchmark factors returns. We provide a full asymptotic theory for our SDF estimators to test for the statistical significance of each fund's performance and for the relevance of individual benchmark factors within each proposed measure. We apply our methodology to a panel of 4815 individual hedge funds. Our empirical analysis reveals that fewer funds have a statistically significant positive alpha compared to the Jensen's alpha obtained by the traditional linear regression approach. Moreover, the funds' rankings vary considerably between the two approaches. Performance also varies between the members of our family because of a different fund exposure to higher-order moments of the benchmark factors, highlighting the potential heterogeneity across investors in evaluating performance.

Photoredox process induced polymerization reactions: iridium complexes for panchromatic photo-initiating systems,"The photoredox catalysis applied to the field of polymers and more particularly to the design of photoinitiating systems is briefly reviewed. Two novel phenylisoquinoline-based iridium complexes with fluorine substituents (bis[5-fluoro-2-(1-isoquinolinyl-κN)phenyl-κC](2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato-κO3,κO5)-iridium (III) (Ir_b) and bis[3,5-difluoro-2-(1-isoquinolinyl-κN)phenyl-κC](2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato-κO3,κO5)-iridium (III) (Ir_c) are proposed as photoredox catalysts (also called photoinitiator catalysts) and incorporated into suitable photoinitiating systems for cationic and radical polymerization. (3,4-Epoxycyclohexane)methyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexylcarboxylate (EPOX) and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) were used as benchmark monomers for cationic and radical photopolymerization. These new catalysts are compared to our very recently proposed unsubstituted catalyst compound: bis[2-(1-isoquinolinyl-κN)phenyl-κC](2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato-κO3,κO5)-iridium (III) (Ir_a). Remarkably, these catalysts exhibit improved light absorption properties and are characterized by a panchromatic behavior which ensures the photosensitivity of the polymerizable films to blue, green and red lights. The photochemical properties as well as the chemical mechanisms associated with these catalysts are investigated by ESR spin-trapping, laser flash photolysis, steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry and luminescence experiments. The structure/reactivity relationships as well as the substitution effect (by the fluorine) are discussed",['chim']
A power efficient cluster-based routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks: Honeybees swarm intelligence based approach,"The design of low-power scalable wireless sensor networks remains a key challenge of the research. Clustering and routing have been widely studied for extending the lifetime of a network, which is a critical issue in sensor networks. Routing involves non-negligible operations, which considerably affect the network lifetime and the throughput. The clustering technique with data aggregation on cluster heads has an influence on the overall performance of the network since it is favoring a maximum network lifetime. This paper presents a novel cluster-based routing protocol called ABC-SD. The proposed protocol exploits the biologically inspired fast and efficient searching features of the Artificial Bee Colony metaheuristic to build low-power clusters. For the choice of cluster heads, a multi-objective fitness function is designed by using a Linear Programming formulation. The routing problem is addressed by a cost-based function that makes a trade-off between the energy efficiency and the number of hops of the path. The clustering process is achieved at the Base Station with a centralized control algorithm, which exploits energy levels and the neighborhood information of location-unaware sensors. As for the routing of gathered data, it is realized in a distributed manner. Furthermore, unlike the existing protocols in the literature, a realistic energy model is adopted in the considered network model. The proposed protocol is intensively experimented with a number of topologies in various network scenarios and the results are compared with the well-known cluster-based routing protocols that include the swarm intelligence based protocols. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in terms of network lifetime, network coverage and the amount of packets delivered to the Base Station.",['info']
Location of CO 2 during its uptake by the flexible porous metal–organic framework MIL-53(Fe): a high resolution powder X-ray diffraction study,"The interaction of CO2 with the porous metal-organic framework material MIL-53(Fe), Fe-III(OH)(0.8)F-0.2[O2C-C6H4-CO2] has been studied by complementary gas adsorption and high resolution powder X-ray diffraction as a function of gas pressure. It has been shown that CO2 adsorption occurs in three steps, with firstly the formation of an ""Intermediate"" (INT) form [S. G. P (1) over bar; V = 916.80(6) angstrom(3)] at room temperature and 2 bar, followed by the transition to a ""Narrow Pore"" (NP) form [S. G. C2/c; V = 1083.01(2) angstrom(3)] at 10 bar. The ""Large Pore"" (LP) form [S. G. Imcm; V = 1563.10(4) angstrom(3)] is obtained also at 10 bar but by decreasing the temperature to 220 K. Crystal structures of the three CO2 materials MIL-53(Fe)[nCO(2)], with n = 0.22, 0.63 and 2.72, have been solved and refined, which has allowed precise localisation of guest CO2 molecules, not previously determined. This shows that the (INT) form presents two types of tunnels of different sizes, with only the largest ones are occupied by the CO2 molecules. In the (NP) and (LP) forms, all tunnels become equivalent and are occupied by CO2. The huge unit cell volume increase of the (LP) form leads to drastic increase in the amount of CO2 adsorbed. In the three forms, CO2 molecules are located in order to favour interactions between their oxygen atoms and the OH/F groups of the framework and there is no evidence for guest-guest interactions until the highest loading where short contacts of a similar distance found in solid CO2 are observed.",['chim']
Can technology be leveraged for bridging the rural-urban divide?,"Inequalities exist and persist in society in different forms and are often areas of prime concern for governments and policy makers around the globe. One such inequality that plagues societies is the rural-urban divide. Several social entrepreneurs are attempting to leverage technology to bridge this divide. In our research-in-progress paper, we describe the case of an Indian company, which is leveraging technology to create knowledge-based jobs for the rural Indian population. The approach adopted by the company in initiating and sustaining such an effort was an inside-out approach in contrast to the usual approach of focusing only on the internal resources within the company. Specifically, our research aims at abstracting the process mechanisms that enabled such an initiative. The unearthed mechanisms would inform future research on the modalities for orchestrating such an initiative. The findings would also help practitioners, especially social entrepreneurs, to think of innovative business models that would create value not only for the company but also for society as a whole. The delineated learnings would also help enthused social entrepreneurs to transplant such initiatives to other regions of the world.","['info', 'shs']"

Service-oriented sharing of energy in wireless access networks using shapley value,"We investigate in this paper the sharing of energy consumption among service categories in the access of a wireless network. We focus on the fixed component of the energy consumption , which is known to be significantly larger than the load-dependent variable component, and propose its sharing among the service categories based on coalition game concept, the Shap-ley value. We consider five service categories, two large players: streaming and web browsing, and three smaller ones: download, voice and other minor services, and compare our proposal with two other sharing methods: uniform and proportional which follows the same traffic proportions. Our results, applied on a real dataset extracted from an operational network in Europe, show that our proposal is more fair both towards small services in that it reduces their shares in comparison to the uniform approach and towards larger services as it reduces their shares in comparison with the proportional one. Indeed, our Shapley-based model accommodates both short term network behavior, in which the fixed energy component is independent of the traffic load, and longer term behavior, in which it varies with the load and infrastructure. Uniform sharing accounts only for the short term, and the proportional one only for the longer term.",['info']
WE-MQS-VoIP Priority: An enhanced LTE Downlink Scheduler for voice services with the integration of VoIP priority mode,"The Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a high data rates and fully All-IP network. It is developed to support well to multimedia services such as Video, VoIP, Gaming, etc. So that, the real-time services such as VoIP, video, etc. need to be optimized. Nevertheless, the deployment of such live stream services having many challenges. Scheduling and allocating radio resource are very important in LTE network, especially with multimedia services such as VoIP. When voice service transmitted over LTE network, it is affected by many network impairments where there are three main factors including packet loss, delay, and jitter. This study proposes a new scheduler which is based on VoIP priority mode, Wideband (WB) E-model, QoS-and Channel-Aware (called WE-MQS-VoIP Priority scheduler) for voice services in LTE downlink direction. The proposed scheduling scheme is built based on the WB E-model and Maximum Queue Size (MQS). In addition, we integrate the VoIP priority mode into our scheduling scheme. Since the proposed scheduler considers the VoIP priority mode and user perception, thus, it improves significantly the system performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduler not only meets QoS demands of voice calls but also outperforms Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (M-LWDF) in terms of delay, Packet Loss Rate (PLR) for all number of user (NU) and excepting NU equals 30, respectively. For Fairness Index (FI), cell throughput, and Spectral Efficiency (SE), the difference among the packet schedulers is not significant.

WE-MQS: A new LTE Downlink Scheduling Scheme for Voice Services based on User Perception,"The Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a high data rates and fully All-IP network. Scheduling and resource allocation are very important tasks in LTE network. So that, the optimization of the real-time services transmission is very essential. However, there are many challenges when deploying the live multimedia services such as VoIP, Video, etc. This paper proposes a new scheduling scheme which based on the Wideband (WB) E-model, Channel-and QoS-Aware (known as WE-MQS scheduler) for voice traffic in LTE downlink direction. The voice traffic flow is very sensitive to network impairments such as delay, packet loss, jitter, etc. The proposed scheduling scheme is based on the extension of the WB E-model and the consideration of Maximum Queue Size (MQS) as a factor for the metric. Since this scheduling scheme considers Mean Opinion Score (MOS) values, thus, it gets higher user perception. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has the performance which not only satisfies QoS requirements of voice services but also outperforms well-known schedulers such as Frame Level Scheduler (FLS), Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (M-LWDF) and Exponential/Proportional Fair (EXP/PF) schedulers in terms of delay for all the number of user (NU) and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) when the NU is more than 47. For the cell throughput, Fairness Index (FI), and Spectral Efficiency, the proposed scheduler is always in the middle of the remaining schedulers.

A New Non-intrusive Model for Measuring VoLTE Quality based on Wideband E-model,"Long Term Evolution (LTE) was initially designed for a high data rates network. However, voice service is always a main service that brings a big benefit for mobile operators. Hence the deployment of Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is very essential and urgent. LTE network is a fully All-IP network, thus, the deployment of VoLTE is very complex, specially for guaranteeing of Quality of Service (QoS) to meet quality of experience of mobile users. The key purpose of this paper is to present an object, non-intrusive prediction model for VoLTE quality based on LTE-Sim framework and Wideband (WB) E-model. In order to simulate the experiment, we deployed LTE-Sim framework combining C programming in Matlab software. The outputs of the LTE-Sim will be the inputs of the WB E-model. The output of the WB E-model is user satisfaction via Mean Opinion Score (MOS). In addition, due to voice over LTE network (VoLTE) uses Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) for vocoder while LTE-Sim supports only G.729 codec for narrow band, thus, we propose to add AMR-WB codec into LTE-Sim software. The simulation results show that the proposed model can predict voice quality in LTE network via the WB E-model. The proposed model does not refer to the original signal, thus, it is very suitable for predicting voice quality in LTE network for many different scenarios which are configured in the LTE-Sim framework. The proposed model is very suitable for predicting VoLTE quality for transmission planning, and for researchers in Laboratory.",['info']

Energy-efficiency-aware upgrade of network capacity,"Energy efficiency of a network, defined as the number of bits transmitted per unit of consumed energy, increases with the traffic load for a constant network capacity. This comes from the fact that energy is composed of two components: a fixed one, consumed by the network regardless of the traffic load, and a variable one, which depends on the traffic load. And so, when traffic load increases, the fixed component gets amortized. However, a network upgrade, namely adding more equipment in the network to fit traffic increase, comes typically with a higher increase in capacity than traffic, at least for a while after the upgrade, as traffic previsions are based on relatively long term projections. Thus, the power consumption of the network would increase faster than the traffic, and energy efficiency would then decrease. We investigate in this work the conditions under which a network upgrade does not deteriorate its energy efficiency. We consider two ways of upgrading a network: either by adding equipment with the same technology or by deploying equipment with another technology, typically more recent and more efficient. We discuss in both cases the number of equipment to be added so that to preserve the network's energy performance",['info']

Predicting VoLTE Quality using Random Neural Network,"Long Term Evolution (LTE) was initially designed for a high data rates network. However, voice service is always a main service that drives huge profits benefit for mobile phone operators. Hence the deployment of Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is very essential. LTE network is a fully All-IP network, thus, the deployment of VoLTE is quite complex, specially for guaranteeing of Quality of Service (QoS) for meeting quality of experience of mobile users. The key purpose of this paper is to present an object, non-intrusive prediction model for VoLTE quality based on Random Neural Network (RNN). In order to simulate an experiment, a three-layer feed-forward RNN architecture with gradient descent training algorithm is applied. The inputs of this model are object network impairments such as Packet Loss Rate (PLR), Delay and Jitter. The VoLTE quality was predicted in term of the Mean Opinion Score (MOS). The simulation results show that this model offers MOS values which are quite close to well-known method is WB-PESQ (Wideband Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) model. The results also show that the proposed model is very suitable for predicting voice quality over LTE network.",['info']
Sharing of energy among service categories in wireless access networks using Shapley value,"We investigate in this paper the sharing of energy consumption among service categories in the access of a wireless network. We focus on the fixed part of the energy consumption of the network, which is known to be significantly larger than the load-dependent variable part, and propose its sharing among the service categories based on coalition game concept, the Shapley value. We consider five service categories, two large players: streaming and web browsing, and three smaller ones: download, voice and other minor services, and compare our proposal with two other sharing strategies: uniform and proportional which follows the same volume proportions. Our results, applied on a real dataset extracted from an operational network in Europe, show that our proposal is more fair both towards small services in that it reduces their shares in comparison to the uniform approach, and towards larger services as it reduces their shares in comparison with the proportional one. Indeed, our Shapley-based model accommodates both short term network behavior, in which the fixed energy component is independent of the traffic load, and longer term behavior, in which it varies with the load and infrastructure. Uniform sharing accounts only for the short term, and the proportional one only for the longer term.","['info', 'spi']"
"Physical, Spectroscopic and Thermal Characterization of Biofield treated Myristic acid","Myristic acid has been extensively used for fabrication of phase change materials for thermal energy storage applications. The objective of present research was to investigate the influence of biofield treatment on physical and thermal properties of myristic acid. The study was performed in two groups (control and treated). The control group remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treated group. The control and treated myristic acid were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and Laser particle size analyzer. XRD results revealed alteration in intensity of peaks as well as significant increase in crystallite size (27.07%) of treated myristic acid with respect to control. DSC study showed increase in melting temperature of treated myristic acid as compared to control. Nevertheless, significant change (10.16%) in latent heat of fusion (∆H) was observed in treated myristic acid with respect to control. TGA analysis of treated myristic acid showed less weight loss (31.33%) as compared to control sample (60.49%). This may be due to increase in thermal stability of treated myristic acid in comparison with control. FT-IR results showed increase in frequency of –CH2 and C=O stretching vibrations, probably associated with enhanced bond strength and force constant of the respective bonds. The particle size analyzer showed significant decrease in average particle size (d50 and d99) of treated myristic acid with respect to control. Overall, the results showed significant alteration in physical, spectroscopic and thermal properties of myristic acid. The enhanced crystallite size, and thermal stability of treated myristic acid showed that treated myristic acid could be used as phase change material for thermal energy storage applications. .",['sdv']
Influence of Biofield Energy Treatment on Isotopic Abundance Ratio in Aniline Derivatives,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance of 13C/12C or 2H/1H or 15N/14N ≡ (PM+1)/PM in aniline; and (PM+1)/PM and 81Br/79Br ≡ (PM+2)/PM in 4-bromoaniline using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Aniline and 4-bromoaniline samples were divided into two parts: control and treated. The control part remained as untreated, while the treated part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. The treated samples were subdivided in three parts named as T1, T2, and T3 for aniline and four parts named as T1, T2, T3, and T4 for 4-bromoaniline. The GC-MS data revealed that the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1)/PM in aniline was increased from -40.82%, 30.17% and 73.12% in T1, T2 and T3 samples respectively. However in treated samples of 4-bromoaniline the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM was increased exponentially from -4.36 % (T1) to 368.3% (T4) as compared to the control. A slight decreasing trend of the isotopic ratio of (PM+2)/PM in 4-bromoaniline was observed after biofield energy treatment. The GC-MS data suggests that the biofield energy treatment has significantly increased the isotopic abundance of 2H, 13C and 15N in the treated aniline and 4-bromoaniline, while slight decreased the isotopic abundance of 81Br in treated 4-bromoaniline as compared to their respective control.",['chim']
"Physical, Thermal and Spectroscopic Characterization of m-Toluic Acid: an Impact of Biofield Treatment","m-Toluic acid (MTA) is widely used in manufacturing of dyes, pharmaceuticals, polymer stabilizers, and insect repellents. The aim of present study was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties of MTA. MTA sample was divided into two groups that served as treated and control. The treated group received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Subsequently, the control and treated samples were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyser, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. XRD result showed a decrease in crystallite size in treated samples i.e. 42.86% in MTA along with the increase in peak intensity as compared to control. However, surface area analysis showed an increase in surface area of 107.14% in treated MTA sample as compared to control. Furthermore, DSC analysis results showed that the latent heat of fusion was considerably reduced by 40.32%, whereas, the melting temperature was increased (2.23%) in treated MTA sample as compared to control. The melting point of treated MTA was found to be 116.04°C as compared to control (113.51°C) sample. Moreover, TGA/DTG studies showed that the control sample lost 56.25% of its weight, whereas, in treated MTA, it was found 58.60%. Also, Tmax (temperature, at which sample lost maximum of its weight) was decreased by 1.97% in treated MTA sample as compared to control. It indicates that the vaporisation temperature of treated MTA sample might decrease as compared to control. The FT-IR and UV-Vis spectra did not show any significant change in spectral properties of treated MTA sample as compared to control. These findings suggest that biofield treatment has significantly altered the physical and thermal properties of m-toluic acid, which could make them more useful as a chemical intermediate.",['chim']
Effect of Biofield Treatment on the Physical and Thermal Characteristics of Aluminium Powders,"Aluminium powders are used in a wide range from propelling rockets to improving personal hygiene. More popular industrial applications include manufacture of silver metallic pigments, paints, inks, plastics, packaging, textiles and aerospace industry. As thick film pastes used in the manufacture of silicon solar cells, and as reducing agent and sources of heat, used in alumina thermic and exothermic applications. In the present investigation, Aluminium powders were exposed to non-contact Biofield treatment. Both the exposed and unexposed powders were later characterized by various techniques. The average particle size, after a slight initial decrease was found to increase after 80 days of treatment substantially, which suggested the operation of competing mechanisms fracture and sintering (micro welding). The BET surface area monotonically decreased which was consistent with increase in particle size. SEM photographs showed that samples exposed to Biofield after 38 days showed growth in particle size and particles joined at inter and intra particle boundaries. X-ray diffraction of the powder samples indicated both increase and decrease in crystallite size, unit cell volume, change in nuclear charge per unit volume of atom and atomic weight of samples exposed to Biofield even after 106 days. These results indicated that properties of Aluminium powders could be changed even up to atomic level by exposure to Biofield.",['phys']
"Physical, Thermal and Spectroscopic Studies on Biofield Treated p-Dichlorobenzene","Para-dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) is widely used as a chemical intermediate in manufacturing of dyes, pharmaceuticals, polymers and other organic synthesis. The aim of present study was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physical, thermal, and spectroscopic properties of p-dichlorobenzene. The p-dichlorobenzene sample was divided into two groups that served as treated and control. The treated group received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Subsequently the control and treated samples were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. XRD result showed an increase in crystallite size (4.93%) along with alteration in peak intensity of treated sample as compared to control. Furthermore, DSC analysis results showed that the latent heat of fusion of treated p-dichlorobenzene was considerably reduced by 8.66% as compared to control. The reduction in melting point of treated sample (54.99°C) was also observed as compared to control (57.01°C) p-dichlorobenzene. Moreover, TGA/DTG studies showed that Tmax (temperature, at which sample lost maximum of its weight) was increased by 6.26% and weight loss per degree celsius (°C) was decreased by 12.77% in biofield treated p-dichlorobenzene as compared to control sample. It indicates that thermal stability of treated p-dichlorobenzene sample might increase as compared to control sample. However, no change was found in UV-Vis spectroscopic character of treated p-dichlorobenzene as compared to control. These findings suggest that biofield treatment has significantly altered the physical and thermal properties of p-dichlorobenzene, which could make it more useful as a chemical intermediate.",['chim']

"Effect of Bio Field Treatment on the Physical and Thermal Characteristics of Silicon, Tin and Lead Powders","Silicon, tin and lead powders belong to group IV in periodic table and exhibit decreasing semi conducting nature towards the bottom of the group. These are very useful in producing non ferrous powder metallurgy components. In the present investigation silicon, tin and lead powders are exposed to bio field. Both the exposed and unexposed powders are later characterized by various techniques. The average particle size, after an initial decrease is found to increase with increase in number of days after treatment although the size is lee than that exhibited by untreated powder, suggesting the operation of competing mechanisms fracture and sintering. The BET surface area increased slightly in silicon powder but did not change in tin and lead powders. SEM photographs showed that samples exposed to bio field after 20 days showed fracture paths and fractures at inter and intra particle boundaries in treated powders. Thermal analysis indicated a decrease in heat of reaction and decrease in mass in treated samples. X-ray diffraction of the powder samples indicated both increase and decrease in crystallite size, unit cell volume and molecular weight of samples exposed to bio field even after 179 days. These results indicate that the properties of the metallic powders can be controlled even up to atomic level by exposing to bio field.",['phys']
What do we learn about development from baby robots?,"Understanding infant development is one of the greatest scientific challenges of contemporary science. A large source of difficulty comes from the fact that the development of skills in infants results from the interactions of multiple mechanisms at multiple spatio-temporal scales. The concepts of “innate” or “acquired” are not any more adequate tools for explanations, which call for a shift from reductionist to systemic accounts. To address this challenge, building and experimenting with robots modeling the growing infant brain and body is crucial. Systemic explanations of pattern formation in sensorimotor, cognitive and social development, viewed as a complex dynamical system, require the use of formal models based on mathematics, algorithms and robots. Formulating hypothesis about development using such models, and exploring them through experiments, allows us to consider in detail the interaction between many mechanisms and parameters. This complements traditional experimental methods in psychology and neuroscience where only a few variables can be studied at the same time. Furthermore, the use of robots is of particular importance. The laws of physics generate everywhere around us spontaneous patterns in the inorganic world. They also strongly impact the living, and in particular constrain and guide infant development through the properties of its (changing) body in interaction with the physical environment. Being able to consider the body as an experimental variable, something that can be systematically changed in order to study the impact on skill formation, has been a dream to many developmental scientists. This is today becoming possible with developmental robotics.","['scco', 'info']"
Comparative Analysis of Single Image Shadow Detection and Removal in Aerial Images,"The article for the specific region segmentation is discussed here. This paper compares the work done on the contour model based shadow detection algorithm with the random field model based shadow detection method. The contouring based shadow detection model adapts the traditional geometric active contours that the contour is steadily subjective toward the shaded region and the shadowy regions in the picture. The shadow region segmentation follows the post processing for optimal threshold calculation. The complexity metric is constructed to separate the boundary of true shadow regions. Whereas the random field model based on shadow exposure process uses a superficial outside descriptor, and colour shade area, to describe the colour surface variants. The conditional random field is combined with the colour descriptors to locate lighting pair and acquire the shaded portion. The shadow region riddance by neighbourhood shade constancy utilizes anisotropic dispersion to guess the local image pixel illumination in shadow region and provides the better performance in shadow region illumination enhancement.",['info']

Sensory-motor Anticipation and Local Information Fusion for Reliable Humanoid Approach,"The possibility of developing increasingly sophisticated robots, and the availability of cloud-connected resources, have boosted the interest in the study of real world applications of service robotics. However, in order to operate under natural or less structured conditions, and given the information processing bottleneck and the reactivity required for a secure execution of the task, it is desirable that the agent can exploit more efficiently the local information available, so that being more autonomous, and relying less on remote computation. This study explores a strategy for obtaining reliable approach tasks. It considers the anticipation of perception, by taking into account the statistical regularities and the information redundancies induced in the sensory-motor coupling. From an initial perception of the object assisted by remote computation, contextual features are defined for capturing bodily sensations emerging in the task. The observations based on proprioceptive and visual data are fused in a Bayesian Network, which is in charge of assessing the saliency during the object approach, thus constituing a local discriminative processing of the object. The strategy proposed reduces dependency on context-free models of behavior, while providing an estimate on the degree of confidence in the progress of the task.",['spi']
"Cuba Meets the Challenges of the 21st Century : Interview with Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban Parliament","President of the Cuban Parliament since 1992, and member of the Political Bureau of the Cuban Communist Party, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada is, after President Raul Castro and First Vice-President Antonio Machado Ventura, third in line in the Cuban government. Professor of philosophy and a career diplomat, Alarcon spent nearly 12 years in the United States as the Cuban ambassador to the United Nations. Over time, he has become a spokesperson for the Havana government. In this long interview, one that lasted nearly two hours, Alarcon did not seek to evade a single question. He comments on the role of Fidel Castro after his retirement from political life and explains the presence of Raul Castro at the center of power. He also speaks about the reform of the Cuban economic and social model as well as the challenges facing the Cuban nation. Alarcon then discusses the question of emigration and Cuban relations with the United States under the Obama administration. He also takes on the thorny question of human rights and political prisoners and does not hesitate to talk about Alan Gross, the American sub-contractor imprisoned in Cuba, as well as the case of the five Cuban agents detained in the United States. Alarcon then turns to the important question of oil deposits in the Gulf of Mexico and the potential consequences of their exploitation. The interview concludes with a discussion of the relationship of Cuba with the Catholic church and the Vatican, the imminent visit to Cuba of Pope Benedict XVI, Cuban relations with the European Union and the new Latin America and finally the future of Cuba after Fidel and Raul Castro.",['shs']
Viewing basic math through the lens of history: Undergraduates' reflective learning in a history-augmented mathematics classroom,"This study is aimed at determining first-year university students' reflections when Fibonacci tiling, the ancient Chinese fang cheng procedures, and the ancient Indian meru prastara recursions were introduced as historical snippets in an adventure pedagogy for basic mathematics. Seventy-eight first-year students enrolled in a course in basic mathematics at a University in North Central Nigeria provided composite self-reports in an action research paradigm, describing their reflective learning after exposure to the historical snippets. Qualitative data reduction strategies were used to explore the students' reflections and progress in the course. The results of the study revealed that the introduction of the historical snippets aids in concretizing of concepts, spurring of behavioural engagement in learners, adding of aesthetic value to mathematics, sustaining of students attention, computational ease and effective recall of mathematical procedures. The activities of the cultural and historical augmentation were reported by participants as plays that accomplish real mathematical tasks. The outcome of this study has strengthened the belief that the history-as-a-tool style of mathematics instruction stimulates curiosity and sustains interest in students while establishing meaningful relationships between abstract ideas and practical applications in the context of the real world.","['math', 'shs']"
Restoration of Degraded Lands Affected by Salinization Process under Climate Change Conditions: Impacts on Food Security in the Senegal River Valley,"With the progressive degradation of agricultural lands due to climate change, there is a need to document how land responds to management practices and their resilience to salinization processes. Salinization is a problem associated with agriculture and it constitutes a constraint which results in inappropriate practices. In addition, agriculture intensification and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns expected from climate change are likely to affect the saltwater balance of fragile ecosystems. Information on the relationship between climate change and salt-affected land salinization processes is scattered. Little has been done to highlight the most affected or vulnerable areas or to promote practices that can be used to adapt agricultural production in fragile areas to climate change. This study will contribute to food security and reducing the stress on ecosystems. This study relates land management practices to lands degraded and salinized due to climate change. Several land management practices have been used to evaluate the level of restoration of degraded lands. Changes in temperature, relative humidity, evaporation , solar radiation, and soil temperature combined with agricultural management practices driven by different cropping systems were used to evaluate the best and most adapted management practices for degraded lands that are dedicated to agriculture. Results suggest that regular seasonal cropping under irrigation might be recommended for degraded lands to assure sustainable food security.","['sdv', 'sde']"

"Physicochemical, Thermal and Spectroscopic Characterization of Sodium Selenate Using XRD, PSD, DSC, TGA/DTG, UV-vis, and FT-IR","Sodium selenate is an important inorganic compound, but lacks reliable and accurate physico-chemical and spectral characterization information. This article described the in-depth physicochemical, thermal, and spectroscopic characterization of sodium selenate using various analytical techniques. The powder X-ray diffractogram showed well-defined, narrow and sharp peaks indicating that sodium selenate is crystalline in nature. The crystallite size was found to be in the range of 28.75 to 49.97 nm. The average particle size was found to be of 3.93 (d10), 14.44 (d50), and 40.65 (d90) µm with an average surface area of 0.676 m2/g. The differential scanning calorimetry showed the endothermic inflation at 588.81 °C with the latent heat of fusion 103 J/g. The thermogravimetric analysis revealed two steps of the thermal degradation process. Similarly, the differential thermogravimetric analysis exhibited the major peaks in the thermogram and disclosed Tmax at 852.65 °C. This indicated sodium selenate thermally more stable in nature. The UV-visible spectrum showed maximum absorbance at 205.1 nm (λmax). The Fourier transform infrared spectrum showed a peak at 888 cm-1 due to the Se-O stretching.

"Evaluation of the Impact of Biofield Energy Healing Treatment (The Trivedi Effect®) on the Physicochemical, Thermal, Structural, and Behavioral Properties of Magnesium Gluconate","Magnesium gluconate is a classical organometallic salt used for the prevention and treatment of magnesium deficiency diseases. The objective of the current research was to explore the influence of The Trivedi Effect® - Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment on the physicochemical, thermal and behavioral properties of magnesium gluconate using PXRD, PSD, FT-IR, UV-vis spectroscopy, TGA, and DSC analysis. Magnesium gluconate was divided into two parts – one part was control without any Biofield Energy Treatment, while another part was treated with the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely by eighteen renowned Biofield Energy Healers and defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample. The PXRD analysis exhibited significant alteration of the crystal morphology of the treated sample compared with the control sample. The crystallite size of the treated sample was remarkably changed from range -33.33% to 66.65% compared with the control sample. The average crystallite size was increased in the treated sample by 6.13% compared with the control sample. Particle size analysis revealed that the particle size at d10 value was significantly reduced in the treated sample by 13.20% compared with the control sample, although the particle size at d50 and d90 values were increased in the treated sample by 2.75% and 3.72%, respectively. The treated sample’s surface area was significantly enhanced (6.96%) compared with the control sample. The FT-IR and UV-vis analysis showed that the structure of magnesium gluconate remained similar in both the treated and control samples. The TGA analysis revealed that the weight loss of the first and second degradation steps in the treated sample was significantly decreased by 2.89% and 8.43%, respectively compared with the control sample, whereas at the third degradation step, the weight loss was enhanced by 14.80% compared with the control sample. The DSC analysis revealed that the melting point of the control and treated samples were 170.23°C and 170.25°C, respectively. The latent heat of fusion was significantly decreased by 6.15% in the treated sample compared with the control sample. The current study infers that The Trivedi Effect® - Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment might lead to a new polymorphic form of magnesium gluconate, which could be more soluble and bioavailable compared with the untreated compound. Hence, the Biofield Energy Treated magnesium gluconate would be very useful to design better nutraceutical and/or pharmaceutical formulations that might offer better therapeutic responses against inflammatory diseases, immunological disorders, stress, aging and other chronic infections.",['chim']
Biological Realms in Computer Science,"In biology, evolution is usually seen as a tinkering process, different from what an engineer does when he plans the development of his systems. Recently, studies have shown that even in biology, there is a part of good engineering. As computer scientists, we have much more difficulty to admit that there is also a great deal of tinkering in what we do, and that our software systems behave more and more like biological realms every day. This keynote will take you to a journey through the bonds between biology and computer science. Starting with an epistemological and historical view, we will see how these bonds developed over the years, but we will also ask ourselves whether these bonds were intentionally created, or whether they already existed, before we even found them. We will also meet the Engineer and the Tinkerer, and see that they are not necessarily different persons. Finally, through such notions as Determinism, Predictability and Control, we will envision and explain a possible future for our software systems seen as living organisms; a future that's in fact already here, but that we are reluctant to accept.","['info', 'sdv']"

The Comparison of Micro Mechanics Analyses to Some Empirical Properties of Ukam (Cochlospermum Planconii) Fibre Reinforced Polyester Composite,"The comparison of micro mechanics analyses to some empirical properties of cochlospermum planchonii (ukam) fibre reinforced polyester composite has been undertaken. The study developed the composites, which were characterized, and empirical values were generated. The polyester and the ukam fibre, which were used in the manufacture of the composites via weight fractions were also characterized. The properties of the polyester and ukam fibre were then used in the micro mechanics analyses of the developed composites. The study revealed that reinforcement-matrix proportion played a major role in composite property determination. This was observed from both the empirical properties measured and the micro mechanics analyses. It was also observed that micro mechanics analyses did not agree with empirical properties in all cases; this the study revealed that it was because of the complex nature of the interactions between parameters responsible for properties in composites. The study has indicated that where micro mechanics analyses agree with empirical property of the composite the law of mixtures can be used to predict the property of the composite. Introduction. According to [11] the fabrication and properties of composites are strongly influenced by the proportions and properties of the matrix and the reinforcement. The proportions can be expressed either via the weight fraction (), which is relevant to fabrication, or via the volume fraction (), which is commonly used in property calculation. The definitions of and are related simply to the ratios of weight (W) or volume (V) as shown below.",['phys']
Water flow in Carbon and Silicon Carbide nanotubes,"In this work the conduction of ion-water solution through two discrete bundles of armchair carbon and silicon carbide nanotubes, as useful membranes for water desalination, is studied. In order that studies on different types of nanotubes be comparable, the chiral vectors of C and Si-C nanotubes are selected as (7,7) and (5,5), respectively, so that a similar volume of fluid is investigated flowing through two similar dimension membranes. Different hydrostatic pressures are applied and the flow rates of water and ions are calculated through molecular dynamics simulations. Consequently, according to conductance of water per each nanotube, per nanosecond, it is perceived that at lower pressures (below 150 MPa) the Si-C nanotubes seem to be more applicable, while higher hydrostatic pressures make carbon nanotube membranes more suitable for water desalination.","['spi', 'phys']"

HEBREW AND YIDDISH: ONE DOES NOT CHOOSE BETWEEN HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHERL'HEBREU ET LE YIDDISH : ON NE CHOISIT PAS ENTRE SON PERE ET SA MERE,"Since Hebrew is a Semitic and thus consonantic language, the main difficulty for the Yiddish student who does not know the sacred language is how to decipher Hebrew words. But deciphering Hebrew also implies for the reader to be familiar with day-today Jewish life: the latter is rythmed by a whole range of traditional gestures which appear mostly in Hebrew. What is at stake is not only to explain the words' meaning but also to evoke a customs, a belief, a Talmudic sentence, a Biblical episode, a midrash or a Hassidic tale. That is to show the indefectible link existing between Yiddish, Hebrew and Jewish tradition. In this respect modern Hebrew literature exemplifies this reunification between Yiddish and Hebrew by authors such as Aharon Appelfeld. As far as in his early works, that is short sorties published in the sixties, Aharon Appelfeld makes his characters express themselves in Yiddish through Hebrew. In 2001 he eventually wrote a novel One night after the other where the main part is given to the Yiddish language and culture. The parts are thus inverted: the long despised Yiddish language is raised to the status of a Patriarch language, a sacred tongue, also able to guarantee the sur­ vival of the Jewish people.",['shs']
Evaluation of Isotopic Abundance Ratio and Structural Properties of Magnesium Gluconate After Treatment with the Energy of Consciousness Using LC-MS and NMR Spectroscopy,"The current research work was aimed to investigate the impact of The Trivedi Effect® - Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment (Biofield Energy Healing) on the structural properties and isotopic abundance ratio (PM+1/PM) of magnesium gluconate using LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. Magnesium gluconate was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control, while the another part was defined as The Trivedi Effect® Treated sample, which received the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely from eighteen renowned Biofield Energy Healers. The total ion chromatogram of the control sample showed two peaks at Rt of 1.81 and 2.06 min, whereas the treated sample displayed peaks at Rt of 1.79 and 2.04 min. The ESI-MS spectra of the control and the treated samples revealed the presence of the mass for magnesium gluconate ion in two forms at m/z 447 (adduct form with methanol) and 415 (protonated ion) in positive ionization mode. But, it showed the mass for the gluconate ion at m/z 195 in the negative ionization mode. The fragmentation pattern of magnesium gluconate in the treated sample was notably altered compared with the control sample. The proton and carbon signals for CH, CH2 and CO groups in the proton and carbon NMR spectra were found almost similar for the control and treated samples. The LC-MS based isotopic abundance ratio analysis indicated that the PM+1/PM (2H/1H or 13C/12C or 17O/16O or 25Mg/24Mg) in the treated magnesium gluconate ion at m/z 415 was significantly decreased by 79.24% compared with the control sample. Similarly, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM (2H/1H or 13C/12C or 17O/16O) in the gluconate ion was decreased by 6.62% in the treated sample compared with the control sample. The treated magnesium gluconate might be beneficial in the nutraceutical and/or pharmaceutical industries for designing various forms of formulations, which could be providing better therapeutic response against various diseases such as diabetes mellitus, allergy, aging, inflammatory diseases, immunological disorders, and other chronic infections. Consequently, The Trivedi Effect® - Energy of Consciousness Healing Treated magnesium gluconate would be more helpful for understanding the enzymatic reactions as well as assist in the designing of the novel potent enzyme inhibitors by applying its kinetic isotope effects.",['chim']
"Evaluation of the Trivedi Effect®- Energy of Consciousness Energy Healing Treatment on the Physical, Spectral, and Thermal Properties of Zinc Chloride","Zinc chloride has the importance in pharmaceutical/nutraceutical industries for the prevention and treatment of several diseases. The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of The Trivedi Effect®-Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment (Biofield Energy Healing Treatment) on physical, structural, and thermal properties of zinc chloride using PXRD, PSD, FT-IR, UV-vis, TGA, and DSC analysis. Zinc chloride was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control without any, while the other part was defined as the Trivedi Effect® Treated sample, which received the Trivedi Effect® Treatment remotely from eighteen renowned Biofield Energy Healers. The PXRD analysis revealed that the crystallite size and relative intensities of the PXRD peaks significantly altered in the treated sample compared with the control sample. The crystallite size of treated sample was decreased by 4.19% compared with the control sample. The particle size at d10 and d50 of the Biofield Energy Treated sample decreased by 4.72% and 2.70%, respectively compared with the control sample. But, the particle size of the treated sample increased at d90 by 0.83 compared with the control sample. Consequently, the surface area was increased by 3.22% in the treated sample compared with the control sample. The FT-IR spectroscopic analysis revealed that Zn-Cl stretching in the control and treated sample was at 520 cm-1 and 521 cm-1, respectively. The UV-vis analysis exhibited that the wavelength of the maximum absorbance of the control and treated samples was at 196.4 and 196.2 nm, respectively. The TGA thermograms revealed two steps of the thermal degradation and the weight loss of the treated sample was significantly reduced by 22.54% in the 1st step of degradation compared with the control sample. The DSC analysis showed that the enthalpy of decomposition was significantly increased by 34.9% in the treated sample (89.17 J/g) compared with the control sample (66.10 J/g). Overall, DSC and TGA analysis indicated that the thermal stability of the treated sample was increased compared with the control sample. The current study anticipated that The Trivedi Effect®-Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment might lead to generate a new polymorphic form of zinc chloride, which would be more soluble, stable, and higher absorption rate compared with the control sample. Hence, the treated zinc chloride could be very useful to design the various forms of nutraceuticals and pharmaceutical formulation which might be providing a better therapeutic response against inflammatory diseases, immunological disorders, aging, stress, cancer, etc.",['chim']

Development of a VSAT Based Virtual E- Learning System: (ARCSSTE-E as a Case study),"In this modern age, Information and communications technological innovations have turned the world into a small global village. E-Learning is one of the by-products of ICT and has been widely recognized as a valuable tool for learning and training other than the traditional method of learning (which involves physical contact between the student and the instructor). This paper presents the design of virtual classroom interface for teacher and student interaction using VSAT technology, which offers a tremendous potential to provide high-quality education to remote areas in Nigeria and Anglophone countries in Africa. Virtual classroom is a form of e-learning that acts as a supplement to the traditional learning methods, whereby, the physical contact is elusive and yet the classroom management is effective. The case-study for the proposed system is ARCSSTE-E. A conceptual framework for ARCSSTE-E is proposed and is developed to enhance and reach out to people within developing (Africa) countries that cannot make it to ARCSSTE-E due to constraint in time, distance, lack of sponsorship, Financial or other challenges. The study confirms the relevance of the growing interest in the use of virtual e-learning system for distance education.",['info']
Sustaining Attention in a Rapidly Changing World: A Survey of the Status among Mathematics Education Students in Nigeria,"Mathematics education, along with its processes and outcomes, is not left out in the impact of the technological change resonating across the globe. This survey was designed to ascertain the status quo in attention management by mathematics education students in Nigeria in the face of present-day unlimited liberties and possibilities. Two instruments, the Dispositional In-Class Inattentiveness Questionnaire for Mathematics Education Students (DICIQ-MES) and the Smartphone Addiction Scale – Short Version (SAS-SV), were used to measure the students’ levels of inattentiveness and smartphone addiction respectively. The instruments were administered to a sample of 105 mathematics education students at a University in North Central Nigeria. The findings of this study revealed a considerably low level of dispositional in-class inattentiveness and a moderately low level of smartphone addiction among mathematics education students. The study also established a statistically significant positive relationship between smartphone addiction and dispositional in-class inattentiveness among the students. Considering the outcome that attention management is becoming one of the most important skills for learners in this era, this study upholds that mathematics educators teach today’s students how to manage and direct their attention to enable them become successful learners.",['shs']
Immunomodulatory properties and biomarkers characterization of novel Withania somnifera based formulation supplemented with minerals in Sprague Dawley rats,"Herbomineral formulations have been accepted world-wide due to its significant therapeutic outcomes. The study aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of novel herbomineral formulation (TEBEH) on Sprague Dawley rats using cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression. Major immune related parameters were monitored such haemagglutination assay, delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, cellular immune response (CD4+ and CD8+), IgG and IgM, hematological analysis, antioxidant profile, and estimation of major lipid biomarkers. The study results suggest herbomineral formulation significantly (p ≤ 0.05) improved the concentration of primary and secondary titre by 41.18 and 68%. However, the rat paw edema at 24 h showed increased edema by 77.78% (p ≤ 0.01). Herbomineral formulation exhibited increase in the CD4+ and CD8+ counts in animals by 28.03 and 60.70%, respectively. In addition, the concentrations of IgM and IgG were improved by 14.29 and 8.26% respectively. Besides, other supportive parameter such as hematology and antioxidant profile was significantly (p ≤ 0.001) improved, while free radical, lipid peroxidation was decreased. Moreover, the major lipid biomarkers were improved such as decreased triglycerides, LDL and VLDL by 15.88, 3.65, and 16.01%, respectively.

An Efficient Approach for Real-Time Processing of RDSZ-Based Compressed RDF Streams,"In recent years, the volume of generated RDF graphs streams from different fields of applications is very large and therefore difficult to process in an optimized manner. Indeed, processing such data in conventional triplestores can be costly in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Several works have examined data compression approach both on static and dynamic RDF data. In addition to those based on stored RDF data, two recent compression algorithms RDSZ and ERI were focused on RDF streams. Continuous compressed format requires less memory space but cannot be exploited through SPARQL queries. In this paper, we propose an approach for continuous querying RDSZ-based RDF streams without decompression phase. We add three algorithms from simple to aggregate query execution over RDSZ compressed items. Our experimentation use real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposition in term of query execution time and memory save.",['info']

Micromechanical modeling for the probabilistic failure prediction of stents in high-cycle fatigue,"The present paper introduces a methodology for the high-cycle fatigue design of balloon-expandable stents. The proposed approach is based on a micromechanical model coupled with a probabilistic methodology for the failure prediction of stents. This allows to account for material heterogeneity and scatter, to introduce a fatigue criterion able to consider stress gradients, and to perform a probabilistic analysis to obtain general predictions from a limited number of realizations of microstructures investigated. Numerical simulations have allowed to highlight the noteworthy characteristics of the mechanical response in the stent as well as the heterogeneity of the mechanical fields due to stress concentrations in the unit cell geometry and to strain incompatibilities between the grains induced by the anisotropy of their mechanical behavior. The predicted survival probability of the stent is in accordance with the experimental data from the literature. Moreover, the influence of the amplitude of the arterial pressure on the fatigue strength of the stent has been evaluated.",['spi']

Quantification of bacterial fluorescence using independent calibrants,"Fluorescent reporters are commonly used to quantify activities or properties of both natural and engineered cells. Fluorescence is still typically reported only in arbitrary or normalized units, however, rather than in units defined using an independent calibrant, which is problematic for scientific reproducibility and even more so when it comes to effective engineering. In this paper, we report an interlaboratory study showing that simple, low-cost unit calibration protocols can remedy this situation, producing comparable units and dramatic improvements in precision over both arbitrary and normalized units. Participants at 92 institutions around the world measured fluorescence from E. coli transformed with three engineered test plasmids, plus positive and negative controls, using simple, low-cost unit calibration protocols designed for use with a plate reader and/or flow cytometer. In addition to providing comparable units, use of an independent calibrant allows quantitative use of positive and negative controls to identify likely instances of protocol failure. The use of independent calibrants thus allows order of magnitude improvements in precision, narrowing the 95% confidence interval of measurements in our study up to 600-fold compared to normalized units.",['sdv']
The Delta-calculus: syntax and types,"We present the $∆$-calculus, an explicitly typed $λ$-calculus with strong pairs, projections and explicit type coercions. The calculus can be parametrized with different intersection type theories T , e.g. the Coppo-Dezani, the Coppo-Dezani-Salle', the Coppo-Dezani-Venneri and the Barendregt-Coppo-Dezani ones, producing a family of $∆$-calculi with related intersection typed systems. We prove the main properties like Church-Rosser, unicity of type, subject reduction, strong normalization, decidability of type checking and type reconstruction. We state the relationship between the intersection type assignment systems a` la Curry and the corresponding intersection typed systems a` la Church by means of an essence function translating an explicitly typed $∆$-term into a pure $λ$-term one. We finally translate a $∆$-term with type coercions into an equivalent one without them; the translation is proved to be coherent because its essence is the identity. The generic $∆$- calculus can be parametrized to take into account other intersection type theories as the ones in the Barendregt et al. book.",['info']
Adaptive parameter setting in a code modulated visual evoked potentials BCI,"Code-modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEPs) BCI are designed for high-speed communication. The setting of stimulus parameters is fundamental for this type of BCI, because stimulus parameters have an influence on the performance of the system. In this work we design a c-VEP BCI for word spelling, in which it is possible to find the optimal stimulus presentation rate per each subject thanks to an adaptive setting parameter phase. This phase takes place at the beginning of each session and allows to define the stimulus parameters that are used during the spelling phase. The different stimuli are modulated by a binary m-sequence circular-shifted by a different time lag and a template matching method is applied for the target detection. We acquired data from 4 subjects in two sessions. The results obtained for the offline spelling show the variability between subjects and therefore the importance of subject-dependent adaptation of c-VEP BCI.","['scco', 'info']"
Imperméabilisation et urbanisation des sols en Méditerranée (française),"Depuis plusieurs décennies, les territoires méditerranéens font face à une extension sans précédent des villes et des espaces aménagés pour les activités économiques, logistiques et commerciales. Ce phénomène, qui caractérise aussi d’autres régions du monde, est particulièrement fort autour de la Méditerranée, du fait de l’ancienneté du fait urbain, de l’importance de l’économie touristique et résidentielle (principalement sur la rive nord mais aussi sur certains littoraux des rives est et sud) et de la dynamique démographique positive (rives sud et est principalement). Etalement urbain et urbanisation sont ainsi particulièrement caractéristiques des régions méditerranéennes et ont pour conséquence une réduction des surfaces agricoles et naturelles, de même qu’une imperméabilisation accrue des espaces urbains, ce qui correspond à la disparition de sols, au sens écologique du terme. Les retombées sont multiples : elles concernent la biodiversité, les risques naturels (ruissellement et inondations, notamment), la climatologie à l’échelle locale, les paysages, etc. Aussi, le suivi de l’extension des surfaces urbanisées et de l’imperméabilisation des sols constituent aujourd’hui une opération indispensable pour l’aménagement urbain, la planification territoriale et la gestion de l’environnement, et ce à différentes échelles. Le propos de cette intervention est de replacer la problématique de l’urbanisation et de l’imperméabilisation des sols qui en résulte dans le contexte général de la dynamique des territoires en Méditerranée. Il s’agit également de montrer comment sont produites les données sur l’urbanisation des territoires à différentes échelles spatiales et temporelles, de même que des données sur les états de surface, permettant les unes et les autres d’appréhender l’imperméabilisation des sols. La liaison entre dynamique générale de l’urbanisation et réponse en termes de planification spatiale est naturellement abordé. Le propos se place dans une perspective méditerranéenne, mais les illustrations sont principalement prises sur le littoral et les arrière-pays méditerranéens fraçais.","['sde', 'shs']"
Remarks about spatially structured SI model systems with cross diffusion,"One of the simplest deterministic mathematical model for the spread of an epidemic disease is the so-called SI system made of two Ordinary Differential Equations. It exhibits simple dynamics: a bifurcation parameter T0 yielding persistence of the disease when T0>1, else extinction occurs. A natural question is whether this gentle dynamic can be disturbed by spatial diffusion. It is straightforward to check it is not feasible for linear/nonlinear diffusions. When cross diffusion is introduced for suitable choices of the parameter data set this persistent state of the ODE model system becomes linearly unstable for the resulting initial and no-flux boundary value problem. On the other hand “natural” weak solutions can be defined for this initial and no-flux boundary value problem and proved to exist provided nonlinear and cross diffusivities satisfy some constraints. These constraints are not fully met for the parameter data set yielding instability. A remaining open question is: to which solutions does this apply? Periodic behaviors are observed for a suitable range of cross diffusivities.","['sdv', 'math']"

Physicochemical and Spectroscopic Characterization of p-Chlorobenzaldehyde: An Impact of Biofield Energy Treatment,"p-Chlorobenzaldehyde (p-CBA) is used as an important chemical intermediate for the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, dyestuffs, optical brighteners, and metal finishing products. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of biofield energy treatment on the physicochemical and spectroscopic properties of p-CBA. The study was accomplished in two groups i.e. control and treated. The control group was remained as untreated, while the treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. Finally, both the samples (control and treated) were evaluated using various analytical techniques. The surface area analysis showed a substantial increase in the surface area by 23.06% after biofield treatment with respect to the control sample. The XRD analysis showed the crystalline nature of both control and treated samples. The X-ray diffractogram showed the significant alteration in the peak intensity in treated sample as compared to the control. The XRD analysis showed the slight increase (2.31%) in the crystallite size of treated sample as compared to the control. The TGA analysis exhibited the decrease (10%) in onset temperature of thermal degradation form 140°C (control) to 126°C in treated sample. The Tmax (maximum thermal degradation temperature) was slightly decreased (2.14%) from 157.09°C (control) to 153.73°C in treated sample of p-CBA. This decrease in Tmax was possibly due to early phase of vaporization in treated sample as compared to the control. The FT-IR spectrum of treated p-CBA showed the increase in wavenumber of C=C stretching as compared to the control. The UV spectroscopic study showed the similar pattern of wavelength in control and treated samples. Altogether, the surface area, XRD, TGA-DTG and FT-IR analysis suggest that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment has the impact to alter the physicochemical properties of p-CBA. This treated p-CBA could be utilized as a better chemical intermediate than the control p-CBA for the synthesis of pharmaceutical drugs and organic chemicals.",['chim']
What Is the Imagined North?,"The North has been imagined and represented for centuries by artists and writers of the Western world, which has led, over time and the accumulation of successive layers of discourse, to the creation of an “imagined North” – ranging from the “North” of Scandinavia, Greenland, Russia, to the “Far North” or the poles. Westerners have reached the North Pole only a century go, which makes the “North” the product of a double perspective: an outside one – made especially of Western images – and an inside one – that of Northern cultures (Inuit, Sami, Cree, etc.). The first are often simplified and the second, ignored. If we wish to understand what the “North” is in an overall perspective, we must ask ourselves two questions: how do images define the North, and which ethical principles should govern how we consider Northern cultures in order to have a complete view (including, in particular, those that have been undervalued by the South)? In this article, I try to address these two questions, first by defining what is the imagined North and then by proposing an inclusive program to “recomplexify” the cultural Arctic.",['shs']

Influence of Biofield Treatment on Physical and Structural Characteristics of Barium Oxide and Zinc Sulfide,"Barium oxide (BaO) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) are well known for their applications in electrical, optical and chemical industries. The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on the structural and physical properties of BaO and ZnS powder. The study was carried out in two groups, one was set to control, and another group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Control and treated samples of BaO and ZnS were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and surface area analyzer. XRD data showed that lattice parameter and unit cell volume of BaO powder were reduced upto 0.42% and 1.26%, respectively as compared to control. Whereas, density of treated BaO was increased upto 1.27% as compared to control. Besides, the unit cell volume was changed in treated ZnS from -0.55 to 0.24% as compared to control that led to change in density from -0.24 to 0.55% after biofield treatment. However, the crystallite size was substantially increased upto 40.5% and 71.4% in treated BaO and ZnS, respectively as compared to control. FT-IR data exhibited that absorption peaks at wavenumber 862/cm (control) was shifted to 858/cm in treated BaO. Upward shifting of absorption peaks corresponding to Zn-S stretching bond was observed in treated (617/cm) as compared to control (592/cm). Furthermore, surface area result showed that it was reduced by 4.32% and 2.1% in treated BaO and ZnS powder, respectively as compared to control. Hence, these, findings suggest that biofield treatment has altered the structural and physical properties of BaO and ZnS powders.",['phys']
Evaluation of Biofield Treatment on Atomic and Thermal Properties of Ethanol,"Ethanol is a polar organic solvent, and frequently used as a fuel in automobile industries, principally as an additive with gasoline due to its higher octane rating. It is generally produced from biomass such as corn, sugar and some other agriculture products. In the present study, impact of biofield treatment on ethanol was evaluated with respect to its atomic and thermal properties. The ethanol sample was divided into two parts i.e., control and treatment. Control part was remained untreated. Treatment part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Control and treated samples were characterized using Gas chromatography-mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). GC-MS data revealed that isotopic abundance of 13C i.e., δ13C of treated ethanol was significantly changed from -199‰ upto 155‰ as compared to control. The DSC data exhibited that the latent heat of vaporization of treated ethanol was increased by 94.24% as compared to control, while no significant change was found in boiling point. Besides, HPLC data showed that retention time was 2.65 minutes in control, was increased to 2.76 minutes in treated ethanol sample. Thus, overall data suggest that biofield treatment has altered the atomic and thermal properties of ethanol.",['chim']

Low achievers and the quest for institutional standard in mathematics education: A phenomenology of subject matter experts' opinions from Nigerian higher education,"This study adopts a phenomenological paradigm to present mathematics experts’ opinions on the existence of low achievers in Nigeria’s higher education system. Six career mathematicians volunteered from among the participants at a conference of one of Nigeria’s elite academic group to give their in-depth opinion on the role of educational institutions in handling low achievers, their impact on Nigeria’s quest for quality education, and personal approaches for managing low achievers in the mathematics classroom. The explication of the responses of the mathematics experts indicates concerns about the admission system of higher educational institutions and some pertinent pedagogical inadequacies of pure mathematicians. The study also revealed that the continual existence of low achievers in the discipline encourages high rate of dropping-out, poor quality of mathematics educators, and examination malpractice. Participants suggest counseling intervention, retraining of mathematics lecturers in teaching methodologies, and special mindset-boosting programmes as ways of handling low achievers in mathematics education. The phenomenology also unveiled certain unintended outcomes that may form the basis for future research into the peculiar attitudinal characteristics of academic mathematicians.","['math', 'shs']"

Blown Away in the Wind of Change: Can Extinct School Folktales be Awakened through Mathematics Storytelling in Nigerian Basic Education?,"Storytelling has been severally regarded as the oldest method of instruction delivery, particularly for children. This study adopts a simple survey research design to explore the extent of storytelling usage by teachers in the mathematics classroom at the primary education level in Nigeria. The investigation was conducted on the premise that traditional folktales are heading down the path to extinction and are steadily being blown away in the wind of change being fanned by increasing technology penetration in the country. The participants of the study are 38 mathematics teachers drawn randomly from primary schools within Makurdi metropolis of Benue State, Nigeria. Analysis of data obtained through the Basic mathematics Storytelling Investigation (BMSI) revealed that despite the high level of awareness of storytelling as a teaching approach among mathematics teachers, only a meager 37% make use of stories in their mathematics classroom. Additional thematic analysis of stories described by the teachers showed that stories were used to illustrate learning points and motivate learners to action within the instructional context. An unintended outcome from the qualitative methods unveiled specific patterns of stories used by the mathematics teachers that are far from local folktales and oral traditions. There was also an indication that with an appropriate awareness campaign, primary mathematics teachers intend to use storytelling in their future teaching practice.","['math', 'shs']"

HUMAN CAPITAL OR MAN-CAPITAL THEORY,"— Common denominator used usually on the social life, legitimator of the economic, cultural and entrepreneurial activities. The concept of "" human capital "" conquered the planet. It roams indefatigably on all the waves and on all the feathers. Let us override the disillusioned interpretations which see only a latest fad there and let us wonder rather about what make its strength. If we can make the observation that it seems difficult to translate the conceptual contributions of human capital into real activities within the company, then in collective and individual acts, we can make on the contrary the report that is even more difficult to translate this economic theory into words. In spite of the abundant literature with concerns the human capital theory, we find until then no definition which makes the unanimity of all the authors. So what do we know about this concept? Is it suited to stimulate Man in a capital? This is what we try to land on this article.",['shs']
Influence of recycled sand containing fillers on the rheological and mechanical properties of masonry mortars,"In this work, we aim to study experimentally the influence of the fillers (<125 µm) of recycled sand on the properties of masonry mortars, with the same consistency, from the observation of the rheological behavior, slump, plasticity and shear strength and comparison of mechanical strength, compressive, flexural and tensile by splitting at 7 and 28 days. The formulation of the reference mortar based on natural river sand is made with cement CEM I 52.5 (C=506 kg/m3 ), with ratios water/cement = 0.5 and sand/cement = 3.0. The other recycled mortars were shown to have the same plasticity as the reference mortar, and the amount of water added was determined using the weight of the recycled sand. The study was carried out on four series of mortars based on recycled sand with and without superplasticizer, replacing natural sand with recycled sand with and without fillers with different percentages of 0, 15, 30, 40, 50, 75 and 100%. The obtained results show that the recycled sand has relatively low physicochemical properties compared to natural sand due to the heterogeneity and the large percentage of the old hardened mortar contained in the recycled sand, in particular the fractions below 250 µm, a high percentage of fillers greater than 10% and a very high water absorption, seven times higher. The comparative study of different mortar compositions with different percentages of recycled sand with and without fillers showed that fillers require more water, which negatively affects the physical and rheological behavior, but in most cases,the the mechanical performance is better than that of the control mortar, in particular the mortars with admixtures.",['spi']
Swath-bathymetric mapping,"Objectives The main objective of the bathymetric working group was to perform high resolution multibeam surveys during the entire cruise for geomorphological interpretation, to locate geological sampling sites, to interpret magnetic and gravimetric measurements and to expand the world database for oceanic mapping. Precise depth measurements are the basis for creating high resolution models of the sea surface. The morphology of the seabed, interpreted from bathymetric models, gives information about the geological processes on the earth surface. Methods and equipment The main characteristic of the deep water sounding system Atlas Hydrosweep DS-2 is a coverage angle of up to 120°, which results in a depth profile with a length of 3.4 times the water depth perpendicular to the ship's long axis. Most of the time a coverage angle of 100° was applied. The acoustic signal, generated by the hull mounted transducer, has a frequency of 15.5 kHz and allows measurement up to full ocean depth. Based on the acoustic pulse 240 depth measurements with individual opening angles of about 2.3° (in deep water operation) and an accuracy of approximately 1 % of water depth were derived. In addition, the echo amplitudes were converted to multibeam sidescan (4094 pixels per swath) and angular backscatter data (59 values per swath). For the slant range corrections of the outer sonar beams, CTD (conductivity, temperature, density) profiles, collected on this expedition or on former expeditions of other vessels, were mostly used. Where there was no information about the water properties, the automatic crossfan calibration, which generates a swath in the direction of the ship's long axis and adjusts the vertical position of the outer beams by overlaying with the previous central beams, was used to calculate the mean sound velocity in the water column. To assign the depth measurement to a geographic position, the GPS navigation and the ship's motion data, received from the Trimble MS750 GPS system and the MINS ringlaser gyro respectively, were applied. To prevent the disturbance of marine mammals, the multibeam sonar system was switched off during periods, when there was no scientific necessity for surveying the sea floor and if marine mammals were close to the ship (nearer than 100 m). After updating the multibeam system with the HDBE (High Definition Bearing Estimation) soft beam modus, the source level can be adjusted, so that the acoustic energy transmitted into the water is not higher then needed to obtain high quality measurements. The multibeam sonar was exclusively operated in the source level mode ""Maximum Level"", where the maximum source level is reduced manually to a minimum, depending on the water depth and hydroacoustic conditions. Besides operating and observing the multibeam sonar system, the data processing was the main part of the work on board. Erroneous depth measurements, caused by hydroacoustic disturbances i.e. because of sea ice, waves or interferences with other sounding systems, need to be cleaned. The depth editing, as well as the cleaning of navigation spikes, was done using the Caris Hips software. Furthermore, data processing includes integration of the ship's navigation into the ESRI database BatGIS, containing most multibeam survey lines of the AWI. The preparation of meta data describing each data set allows data exchange and archiving. The data preparation for terrain modelling includes the projection of geographic coordinates into metric coordinates and the recomputing of depths. In order to make depth data compatible to previous and subsequent measurements, a sound velocity of 1500 ms-1 has been applied. For the interpretation of the sea bottom topography, digital elevation models (DTM's) were calculated out of the edited data and presented in preliminary bathymetric maps, using the Generic Mapping Tool (GMT) and ESRI ArcGIS software. Based on the DTM's (grid spacing up to 50 m in medium water depths), contour line maps with color-coded depth ranges (scales up to 1 : 100000) and additional information like coastlines and surface elevation, sea ice coverage or sampling stations were produced. Using the ArcGIS module ArcScene, virtual flights above the sea floor were prepared in regions of specific interest. These three- dimensional visualisations faciliate the interpretation of morphology and support interdisciplinary work.",['info']
Geospatial technology for land cover analysis,"The Izmir region in Turkey is extremely valuable for the environment while being used immensely for tourism, agriculture and recreation. The geographic area of western Turkey is known for its unique physical and environmental settings. Due to its location in the Mediterranean climate, the region has certain typical features and is influenced by the local and regional climatic setting. The geography of the region combines diverse landforms, various geomorphological features, natural landscapes, species and vegetation richness: mountainous and hilly landscapes, caves, islands in the coastal area and lakes. The geology of the area of Western Anatolia is characterized by the neotectonic active faulting and high seismicity, which leads to the geomorphic instabilities and landslide formation in the research area. The vegetation in the study area is dominated by typical Mediterranean flora. The current environmental situation within the terrestrial parts of the ecosystems has been well discussed in several works. The main issues concerning deforestation of precious forest communities are desertification, soils erosion and land degradation in the surroundings. Karaburun Peninsula is an important part of Aegean Sea ecosystems and is well known in Turkey as one of the major undisturbed sites in western Turkey with precious biodiversity structure, aesthetic landscapes and unique environment. To maintain sustainable development of the Turkish nature, the unique landscapes should be protected for the sustainable coexistence of man and nature. Other sources of environmental threats are radioactive wastes and radionuclides that originate both from natural sources, for instance leaching from minerals, and from pollutant sources, mostly from nuclear power plants, explosions and accidents. These factors of ecological contamination have direct impact on the terrestrial ecosystems. The classification of Landsat TM imagery for the same study area taken at different years allowed the recording of gradual land degradation. The last one is mainly caused by intensive construction of the second house summer cottages, and tourist activities. Recent changes in land use / land cover types in selected regions of Turkey have been proved usingl land use change detection using measurements of carbon that indirectly indicate the extent of peatlands within the landscapes. The use of the Landsat TM images was applied to assess changes in the land cover types over time. The thematic mapping of the land cover types in the selected area has been done using methods of supervised classification. The legend representing land cover classes include a variety of land types that exist in the Izmir surroundings. After determining the land cover characteristics, separating images into diverse homogeneous areas, a compilation of the following land cover type parameters was done: Urban areas: residential and built-up regions, roads; 2) Croplands-1 (wheat); 3) Croplands-2 (barley and other cereals); 4) Agricultural lands (e.g. cotton); 5) Pastures; 6) Grassland; 7) Shrubland; 8) Broadleaf forest; 9) Evergreen needleleaf forest, pine (Pinus brutia, P.nigra, P.pinea, P.silvestris); 10) Evergreen coniferous forests, firs (Abies); 11) Mixed forests; 12) Wetlands; 13) Sparsely vegetated areas; 14) Water bodies (natural and artificial lakes, rivers); 15) Coppice Training sites were digitised as areas of known land cover type identity. The creation of training polygons was performed using manual digitising available in 'Drawing' function of Erdas Imagine, by specifying the corner points of each polygon. The attributive characteristics on the areas were entered using appropriate columns with 'land cover types'. In such a way, specific training areas were identified for each, from the 15 land use classes. The land cover classes were identified as sets of pixels that best represent each land type and region according to their spectral characteristics and topological information: location, neighborhood, type and size of the polygons.","['sde', 'phys']"

For these reasons the IP rights and the patent strategy are crucial in the implementation of the open model offering the possibilities for fluent technological exchange. Current studies on Chinese innovation process are in the beginning and the Chinese firms face the question how to use the open model in the global technological competition.

Surface water–groundwater interactions in an alluvial valley: combining tools for a better understanding of the recharge capacity of the Isere River alluvial aquifer for the neighborhood of Albertville cityInteractions rivières/nappes alluviales : approche couplée pour mieux comprendre l’alimentation de la nappe alluviale de l’Isère sur le territoire de la Communauté de Communes de la Région d’Albertville (CoRAL),"Combining hydrological, hydrogeological, chemical, isotopic (δ2H and δ18O of water, δ34SSO4 and δ18OSO4 of sulfates, 87Sr/86Sr) and geological data lead to a better understanding of surface water - groundwater interactions for the neighborhood of Albertville city. Accordingly, various water recharge of Isère alluvial aquifer are evidenced on different space scale. Upstream Albertville, alluvial aquifer recharges mainly through water exchange processes with Isère river water. Conversely downstream Albertville, surface water - groundwater interactions are limited and two aquifer units are distinguished. One aquifer unit for the left river bank of the Isère river, involving mainly Beaufortain and Belledonne hillsides recharge (arsenic and antimony inputs due to weathering of metamorphic rocks). One aquifer unit for the right river bank of the Isère river, involving mainly Bauges hillsides recharge (weathering of sedimentary rocks without mobilization of toxic elements). This information is now the new technical reference used by water resource policy makers for the implementation of preservation measures.L’association de données hydrologiques, hydrogéologiques, chimiques et isotopiques (notamment δ2H et δ18O de l’eau, δ34SSO4 et δ18OSO4 des sulfates dissous, 87Sr/86Sr du Sr dissous) et géologiques a permis de disposer d’une meilleure compréhension des interactions rivières/nappes alluviales (encore appelées relations nappe/rivières) sur le territoire d’Albertville.

HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF LEAKAGE CURRENT OF SILICON RUBBER INSULATORS IN CLEAN-FOG AND SALT-FOG,"Environmental and electrical stresses have deterioration effects on Silicon Rubber (SIR) insulators. In coastal areas due to high amount of salt, humidity and dust suspended in the air, the deterioration process is intensive. In this paper, based on IEC 60507 the leakage current (LC) of 20kV SIR insulators has been investigated in clean-fog and salt-fog with and without artificial pollution. Tests have been executed with six similar SIR insulators. A pair of polluted and clean SIR insulators is subjected to clean-fog; other two pairs are subjected to salt-fog with 5 and 10 kg/m 3 salinity respectively. Results show that combination of pollution and salt-fog is more destructive than clean-fog, where the main reason may be the increase of conductivity. Dry band arcing makes insulator perform nonlinearly and some LC waveform harmonic growth. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method, used to find the harmonic spectrum of the LC. Results, also illustrate the coordination between the 3 rd and 5 th harmonic components of the LC and insulators surface condition.",['spi']
A STUDY ON THE RELATION BETWEEN LEAKAGE CURRENT AND SPECIFIC CREEPAGE DISTANCE,"The usage of polymeric insulators is common due to their advantages in comparison with porcelain insulators. Environmental and electrical stresses have got deteriorating effects on polymeric insulators. Thus, knowing about behaviour of these types of insulators under various stresses is necessary. Till now, various electrical tests have been performed on polymeric insulators to investigate their performance in different situations and to provide a solution for predicting their effective lifetime. Also some standards for testing polymeric insulators have been proposed e.g. IEC62217. In this paper, three pairs of similar 63kV and three pairs of similar 132kV polymeric insulators have been selected for studying the relation between leakage current of polymeric insulators and their specific creepage distance based on IEC62217 standard. The specimens have been tested in three different creepage distances which are proportion of overall creepage distance. The Fast Fourier Transform analysis has been used to find the harmonic spectrum of the leakage current. The results showed that the amplitude of harmonic components for 63kV insulators in all three cases is mostly equal to each other and similarly for 132kV insulators.",['spi']
Study of nitrate transfer in the unsaturated zone of two agricultural plots (North of France),"The impact of fertilization in water quality trough the unsaturated zone (i.e. soil and subsoil up to the groundwater) is always difficult to predict because several interrelated processes are occurring. These processes are not only linked to agriculture practices but also to climatic and geological environment. The forecasts are also made complex because these processes vary with time. Indeed, concentrations in the unsaturated zone and in groundwater are the result of the farming practices of several years or even more. This study surveyed various plots in Picardy (North of France) on chalky substrate to better understand the impact of agricultural practices on the (possible) changes in water quality. Surveys were conducted on an agricultural plots with a cultural marker (major change in farming practice). These surveys allowed establishing nitrogen profiles in soil at different depths. Studying these profiles, it is possible on the one hand, to evaluate the present stock of nitrate in the unsaturated zone, and on the other hand, to estimate the speed of transfer of these nitrates. Soil profiles show that concentrations fluctuate in response to agricultural practices varying over the years and also in response to rainfalls. For the study plots, nitrate inputs to soil are less important today than in the past. However, they remain higher than those observed in the plot without fertilization used as a reference. Thanks to the data provided by the farmer, values of nitrogen fertilization have been used to calculate the surpluses and deficits of fertilization, year by year and culture by culture on the plot. A good correlation between the farmer practices and the concentration of nitrogen in the soil was found on the period 1990-2013. This work shows the impact of the fertilization on soil over several years. In the surveyed plots, the speeds of nitrate transfer could be estimated (around 0.6 m/year). Taking into account the thickness of the unsaturated zone (several tens of meters locally) and low estimated speed, the impacts of environmental actions on the water quality could be highly delayed . In the studied plots, where the transfer matrix is preponderant, the impact of current practices would be visible in only approximately 50 years. The findings of the project are valid for the investigated plot only. The change of scale from the surveyed plot to the entire water catchment was not performed during the project.",['phys']

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF BIOFUMIGATION ON THE SPREAD OF RHIZOCTONIA SOLANI IN SUGAR BEET,"Brown root rot, a soil-borne disease caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is becoming more frequent in some sugar beet growing areas. In some cases, this disease can have a significant economic impact and it can be quite difficult to control. Rhizoctonia solani is a saprotrophic polyphagous fungus linving into the soil. During the period when the crop is present it can initiate an epidemic from residuals soil inoculum and spread through secondary infection from plant to plant creating well-documented bare patches of disease. In a disease management perspective biofumigation could present an opportunity to exploit the intercrop period preceding the beet crop. In fact, some scientific works have demonstrated that growing and incorporating mustard could decrease the impact of R. solani on sugar beet. However, from an epidemiological point of view, biofumigation has several effects on the pathogen, some positive and others nega-tive. The balance between these effects could explain the level of success or failure of this biological treatment. Several experimental and modelling results are presented here to show how R. solani spreads in a sugar beet field and how biofumigation affects the epidemic. These research results have the potential to provide strategies for managing the disease.",['sdv']
The role of HCO3 and NA/K ATPase in the regulation of aqueous humor production: a mathematical model.,"Purpose Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is an assessed risk factor for glaucoma. Evidences show that 1)steady-state IOP is determined by aqueous humor (AH) production and drainage and 2) AH production is determined by Na+ and HCO3- secretion into the basolateral (BL) space between nonpigmented epithelial cells (NPECs). However, connection between HCO3- and Na+ is controversial in the regulation of AH production and difficult to study experimentally. Here we propose a mathematical model to theoretically investigate the effect of HCO3- inhibition on the NPEC membrane potential and on the Na/K ATPase. Methods Ions are modeled as charged fluids under electrochemical and fluid forces. AH is modeled as an incompressible fluid under: 1) ion electrical pressure in channel volume; 2) potassium current density JA entering the NPEC at channel intracellular side (A); 3) sodium current density JB entering the BL space at channel aqueous side (B), with JB:JA=3:2 as in physiological Na/K ATPase. Electrostatic potential V is grounded at side A whereas electric field flux is zero at side B. NPEC membrane potential (Vm) is defined as Vm=VB–VA, the baseline being set equal to experimental measurement (on monkeys) in the range [-2.7, -2.3] mV. Results Fig.1 shows that spatial distribution of Vm is close to baseline only if HCO3- is included in the simulation. The negative value of Vm at side B indicates local net anion accumulation. Fig.2 shows the spatial distributions of Na+ and K+ current densities. Na+ current is positive while K+ current is negative, indicating that Na+ flows out the NPEC and K+ flows into the cell. The ratio between the two currents is 1.53 in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of 1.5. Conclusions Model simulation results suggest that HCO3- inhibition may prevent physiologically correct baseline values of Vm and Na/K ATPase function. This may provide useful indication in the design of IOP lowering medications to decrease AH production on an effective patient-specific basis, and supports the advantage of the mathematical model as a noninvasive complement of the animal model.","['info', 'math', 'sdv']"

Effect of sliding velocity on friction-induced microstructural evolution in Copper,"Durability of engineering workpieces surfaces is well-known to be strongly related to the microstructural evolutions induced by machining processes. One current challenge is to choose the right process parameters, such as the sliding speed, in order to optimize both the subsurface microstructure and the surface properties. In this paper, a special tribometer, able to simulate contact pressures and cutting speeds occurring during machining, has been used to characterize the effect of sliding velocity on microstructural evolution induced in copper. Significant recrystallization and grain refinement phenomena have been observed for the highest sliding speed tested (250m/min). Finite element analysis have been performed to extract local variables near the pin/copper bar interface. A good agreement is noticed between the equivalent plastic strain level, the temperature rise, the resulting grain size and the hardness gradient.",['spi']
Requirements Analysis for Context-oriented Systems,"Context-oriented systems are systems that observe and handle context information from the environment to guide their own behavior. Engineering such systems represents a complex task not only due to their complexity, but also due to the notion of context.

In order to help designers on this engineering process, we propose in this paper a roadmap on context management and a requirements elicitation process. This roadmap aims at sharing with non-expert designers the necessary expertise on context management allowing them to better understand the notion of context and its challenges. The elicitation process aims at guiding these non-expert designers across the roadmap, supporting them in their requirements elicitation process concerning context management.

Continuous monitoring of adaptive e-learning systems requirements,"E-learning is a promising research area, as they are expected to increase enrollment and improve the quality of education. Adaptive e-learning systems, traditionally focused on content personalization, are in need to cope with continuous changing requirements and changing environment.

In this paper, we present an approach for continuous requirements monitoring that uses constraint programming to evaluate the satisfaction of the requirements in adaptive e-learning systems and identify solutions (valid configurations) when deviations occur at runtime. To this end, the requirements are conceptualized as a dynamic software product line. A new requirements engineering tool that supports (dynamic) software product line engineering is used for the specification of the adaptive e-learning systems and its continuous monitoring.",['info']

The lake of a linear order amongst elements of intuitionistic fuzzy alternative sets, as stated in [1], oriented the researches to the definition of aggregation methods measuring the distance of each alternative to the best element of an intuitionistic fuzzy set. However, in some real applications such as raking possible items or alternatives according to positive and negative ratings, expressing respectively the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of some buyers in e-commerce applications, the distance may deliver some counter-intuitive results from the user’s standpoint. Therefore, by considering intuitionistic fuzzy alternatives as particular fuzzy bipolar sets, we introduce in this paper an intuitionistic bipolar approach for alternative ranking, based on (i) two intuitionistic preference relations, namely intuitionistic more preferred than or equal to (denoted by ≽I) and intuitionistic less preferred than or equal to (denoted by ≼I), each of which is a linear order, which can be used to rank bipolar alternatives attached with both degrees of acceptance (membership) and rejection (non- membership), and on (ii) two algebraic operators called Intu- itionistic minimum, denoted by Imin, and Intuitionistic maximum, denoted by Imax, to compute respectively the intersection and the union of intuitionistic fuzzy bipolar alternative sets.",['info']
From DBpedia to Wikipedia: Filling the Gap by Discovering Wikipedia Conventions,"Many relations existing in DBpedia are missing in Wikipedia yielding up an information gap between the semantic web and the social web. Inserting these missing relations requires to automatically discover Wikipedia con- ventions. From pairs linked by a property p in DBpedia, we find path queries that link the same pairs in Wikipedia. We make the hypothesis that the shortest path query with maximal containment captures the Wikipedia convention for p. We computed missing links and conventions for different DBpedia queries. Next, we inserted some missing links according to computed conventions in Wikipedia and evaluated Wikipedians feedback. Nearly all contributions has been accepted. In this paper, we detail the path indexing algorithms, the results of evaluations and give some details about social feedback.",['info']
Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling with Batching for Semiconductor Manufacturing,"Scheduling decisions in the diffusion and cleaning area of a semiconductor manufacturing facility have an important impact on the overall performance of a plant. Consequently, we want to optimize those decisions while taking real-world constraints into account. An important property of machines in this work area is their batching capability: They can perform multiple operations at the same time. We want to take account of this in our algorithm. We need to schedule a given set of jobs. For each of them, a fixed sequence of operations must be performed. This sequence is called the route of the job. Operations can only be performed on qualified machines and their processing durations depend on the selected machine. A capacity limit constrains the number of jobs that can be processed per batch. Each operation is assigned to a family and only operations of the same family can be combined in the same batch. For each job, we are given a ready date and a due date. Those constraints describe a flexible job-shop scheduling problem with batching. We aim to minimize total weighted tardiness. For the described problem, we present a simulated annealing algorithm that is based on an extended evaluation of disjunctive graphs. In our proposed approach, batching decisions are taken dynamically during graph traversal.",['info']

De l'outillage des langues nationales sénégalaises pour la transmission des connaissances spécialisées,"Pendant longtemps, les langues négro-africaines étaient considérées comme étant incapables de prendre en charge les connaissances spécialisées. Les langues autochtones sénégalaises ne faisaient pas exception à ce stéréotype. Ce lieu commun avait amené des chercheurs, vers les années 1970, à démontrer que ces langues sont capables de parfaitement supporter et assurer n'importe quelle pensée scientifique et technique. Toutefois, une observation des pratiques langagières effectives a permis de constater que les notions des sciences formelles, naturelles ou appliquées ne sont toujours pas véhiculées dans ces langues. De là, nous avons estimé qu’une approche glottopolitique endogène permettra de promouvoir les langues de spécialité dans les langues locales du Sénégal.",['scco']
Re-Industrialisation: A Panacea for Economic Recovery ?,"Economic growth typically entails a re-allocation of labour away from industrial production, but it does not all by itself lead to falling industrial output. The decline of industrial production in the US and France in the past thirty years is to some extent due to capital exports, but especially to government interventionism in the form of mushrooming labour labours, business and financial regulations, education policies, social security funding, and taxation. This decline cannot be stopped through more interventions, even if they are designed with the good intention to reindustrialise the country.",['shs']

Sparse Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion and Surrogate-Kernel-Based Feature Selection for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Designing an effective criterion to select a subset of features is a challenging problem for hyperspectral image classification. In this paper, we develop a feature selection method to select a subset of class discriminant features for hyperspectral image classification. First, we propose a new class separability measure based on the surrogate kernel and Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Second, we employ the proposed class separability measure as an objective function and we model the feature selection problem as a continuous optimization problem using LASSO optimization framework. The combination of the class separability measure and the LASSO model allows selecting the subset of features that increases the class separability information and also avoids a computationally intensive subset search strategy. Experiments conducted with three hyperspectral data sets and different experimental settings show that our proposed method increases the classification accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","['info', 'sde']"

Discrete rigid registration: A local graph-search approach,"Image registration has become a crucial step in a wide range of imaging domains, from computer vision to computer graphics. The core of image registration consists of determining the transformation that induces the best mapping between two images. This problem is ill-posed; it is also difficult to handle, due to the high size of the images and the high dimension of the transformation parameter spaces. Computing an actually optimal solution is practically impossible when transformations are assumed continuous (i.e., defined on R^n). In this article, we initiate the exploration of a new way of considering image registration. Since digital images are basically defined in a discrete framework (i.e., in Z^n), the transformation spaces – despite a potentially high complexity – actually remain finite, allowing for the development of explicit exploration of the parameter space via discrete optimization schemes. We propose an analysis of the very basis of registration, by considering rigid registration between 2D images. We show, in particular, how this problem can be handled in a fully discrete fashion, by computing locally the combinatorial structure of the parameter space of discrete rigid transformations, and by navigating on-the-flight within this space via gradient descent paradigms. This registration framework is applied in real imaging cases, emphasising the relevance of our approach, and the potential usefulness of its further extension to higher dimension images and richer transformations.",['info']
Familiarization with a Forward Collision Warning on driving simulator: cost and benefit on driversystem interactions and trust,"Introducing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) into the vehicle could improve drivers’ comfort and reduce road crashes. However, suitable methods are required to study driver/system interactions. In fact, ADAS generate critical use cases, i.e. situations where alarms, or absence of alarms, can be negative for safety. The present study aimed at evaluating the impact of getting familiar, by means of a driving simulator, with critical situations when using the Forward Collision Warning system (FCW). We hypothesized that experiencing the system’s function in critical situations would improve drivers’ performance and their trust in the FCW. We compared judgments and driving performance of three independent groups: a “control group” where drivers did not use the FCW, an “unfamiliarized group” where drivers used the FCW without having been familiarized with the system, and a “familiarized group” where drivers used the FCW after having been familiarized. Results showed that familiarization made driver/system interactions more effective and safer. Moreover, familiarized drivers rated the system more positively than unfamiliarized drivers. However, familiarization decreased drivers’ self-confidence and did not prevent from haste when overtaking slow vehicles. We discussed the relevance of using a driving simulator in FCW’s studies and the possibility to transfer skills and knowledge to field operational tests. Finally, we proposed possible improvements to make the familiarization with the system still more effective.Introduire des systèmes avancés d’aide au conducteur dans le véhicule pourrait augmenter le confort des conducteurs et réduire le nombre d’accidents. Toutefois, des méthodes d’évaluations adaptées sont nécessaires à l’étude des interactions conducteur/système. Les systèmes d’aide génèrent effectivement des cas d’usage critiques, i.e. des situations ou les alertes, ou l’absence d’alertes, peuvent être négatives pour la sécurité. L’objectif de la recherche était d’évaluer l’impact de la familiarisation avec les cas critiques d’usage du Forward Collision Warning (FCW) sur simulateur de conduite. Nous avons testé l’hypothèse selon laquelle l’expérience du fonctionnement du FCW dans des situations critiques d’usage augmente la performance de conduite et la confiance des conducteurs dans le système. Nous avons comparé les jugements et la performance de conduite de trois groupes expérimentaux : un groupe contrôle où les conducteurs n’utilisaient pas le FCW, un groupe « non familiarisé » où les conducteurs utilisaient le système sans avoir été familiarisés et un groupe « familiarisé » où les conducteurs utilisaient le système après avoir été familiarisés. Les résultats montrent que la familiarisation rend les interactions conducteur/système plus efficaces et plus sûres. Par ailleurs, les conducteurs familiarisés ont des opinions plus positives sur le FCW comparé aux non familiarisés. Néanmoins, la familiarisation diminue la confiance des participants dans leur capacité de conduite. De plus, elle ne permet pas d’éviter que les conducteurs dépassent de façon trop précipitée les véhicules lents. Nous discutons la pertinence du simulateur pour l’étude du FCW et la possibilité de transfert des connaissances à la conduite sur route réelle. Finalement, nous proposons des améliorations pour rendre la familiarisation avec le système plus efficace.",['info']
Genu recurvatum,"El genu recurvatum se define como la hiperextensión de la rodilla más allá de 180° o posición cero de referencia. En la mayoría de los casos es bilateral, simétrico, de origen constitucional y asintomático.

Front propagation in a vortex lattice: dependence on boundary conditions and vortex depth.,"We experimentally address the propagation of reaction–diffusion fronts in vortex lattices by combining, in a Hele-Shaw cell and at low Reynolds number, forced electroconvective flows and an autocatalytic reaction in solution. We consider both vortex chains and vortex arrays, the former referring to mixed free/rigid boundary conditions for vortices and the latter to free boundary conditions. Varying the depth of the fluid layer, we observe no variation of the mean front velocities for vortex arrays and a noticeable variation for vortex chains. This questions the two-dimensional character of front propagation in low Reynolds number vortex lattices, as well as the mechanisms of this dependence.",['phys']

Perceiving Attitudes Expressed Through Nonverbal Behaviors in Immersive Virtual Environments,"Virtual Reality and immersive experiences, which allow players to share the same virtual environment as the characters of a virtual world, have gained more and more interest recently. In order to conceive these immersive virtual worlds, one of the challenges is to give to the characters that populate them the ability to express behaviors that can support the immersion. In this work, we propose a model capable of controlling and simulating a conversational group of social agents in an immersive environment. We describe this model which has been previously validated using a regular screen setting and we present a study for measuring whether users recognized the attitudes expressed by virtual agents through the real-time generated animations of nonverbal behavior in an immersive setting. Results mirrored those of the regular screen setting thus providing further insights for improving players experiences by integrating them into immersive simulated group conversations with characters that express different interpersonal attitudes.",['info']

The Pecking Order of Segmentation and Liquidity-Injection Policies in a Model of Contagious Crises,"We study a two-country setting in which leveraged investors generate fire-sale externalities, leading to financial crises and contagion. Governments can affect the incidence of financial crisis and the degree of contagion by injecting public liquidity and, additionally, by segmenting the countries' liquidity markets. We show that segmentation allows a country to avoid contagion and fend off mild financial crises caused by a small shock to its liquidity demand, at the cost of exposing it to more severe financial crises caused by a large shock. We derive a ""pecking order"" result, whereby segmentation is a second-best measure that coordinated governments should use only when tax capacity constrains them from injecting liquidity. Even when segmentation is welfare-enhancing, it should be applied to public liquidity alone, never restricting the free ow of private liquidity across countries. Uncoordinated governments tend to use segmentation excessively.",['shs']
New procedure to measure simultaneously the surface tension and contact angle,"This paper proposes a new procedure to simultaneously measure the static contact angle and the surface tension of a liquid using a spherical geometry. Unlike the other existing methods, the knowledge of one of both previous parameters and the displacement of the sphere are not mandatory. The technique is based on the measurement of two simple physical quantities: the height of the meniscus formed on a sphere at the very contact with a liquid bath and the resulting vertical force exerted on this object at equilibrium. The meniscus height, whose exact value requires the numerical resolution of the Laplace equation, is often estimated with an approximate 2D model, valid only for very large spheres compared to the capillary length. We develop instead another simplified solution of the Young-Laplace equation based on the work of Ferguson for the meniscus on a cylinder and adapted for the spherical shape. This alternative model, which is less restrictive in terms of the sphere size, is successfully compared to numerical solutions of the complete Young-Laplace equation. It appears to be accurate for sphere radii larger than only two capillary lengths. Finally the feasibility of the method is experimentally tested and validated for three common liquids and two “small” steel spheres.",['spi']
Modelling of corrosion fatigue crack initiation on martensitic stainless steel in high cycle fatigue regime,"This paper presents an analytical model for assessing the corrosion fatigue crack initiation life on a martensitic stainless steel X12CrNiMoV12-3 in high cycle fatigue regime (between 105 and 107 cycles). Based on in-situ electrochemical measurements during corrosion fatigue tests in NaCl aqueous solution, the corrosion fatigue crack initiation mechanism was identified. Two main stages were investigated: (i) the fracture of the passive film by slip bands and (ii) the free dissolution of the metal developing fatigue crack initiation from a critical corrosion defect. The depassivation stress threshold corresponds to the median fatigue strength at 107 cycles for fatigue corrosion tests. For an applied stress range less than this threshold, the depassivation phenomenon was not observed at 107 cycles and no crack initiation occurred. The proposed model takes into account the depassivation process induced by the slip bands emergence at the specimen surface and the corrosion rate under cyclic loading. The experimental results are compared to the proposed model taking into account mechanical and electrochemical material parameters.",['spi']
Identification and Estimation in a Third-Price Auction Model,"The first novelty of this paper is that we show global identification of the private values distribution in a sealed-bid third-price auction model using a fully nonparametric methodology. The second novelty of the paper comes from the study of the identification and estimation of the model using a quantile approach. We consider an i.i.d. private values environment with risk-averse bidders. In the first place, we consider the case where the risk-aversion parameter is known. We show that the speed of convergence in process of our nonparametric estimator produces at the root-n parametric rate and we explain the intuition behind this apparently surprising result. Next, we consider that the risk-aversion parameter is unknown and we locally identify it using exogenous variation in the number of participants. We extend our procedure to the case where we observe only the bids corresponding to the transaction prices, and we generalize the model so as to account for the presence of exogenous variables. The methodological toolbox used to analyse identification of the third-price auction model can be employed in the study of other games of incomplete information. Our results are interesting also from a policy perspective,as some authors recommend the use of the third-price auction format for certain Internet auctions. Moreover, we contribute to the econometric literature on auctions using a quantile approach.",['shs']
Water policy in Algeria: limits of supply model and perspectives of water demand management (WDM),"In a context combined with demand increase and climate change phenomenon, water scarcity will intensify hence the necessity of efficient water policy. This paper aims to propose an analysis advocating a transition from the supply-side management of water resources to demand-side management (water demand management) for Algeria. Despite many efforts towards building infrastructure, hydraulic engineering and the process of institutional reforms in Algeria from 1999 to 2019, water management continues to focus on upstream water mobilization without downstream valorization. Water policy in Algeria suffers from several major deficiencies: (1) constraints in the absorptive capacity of capital expenditure; (2) low level of water efficiency in drinking water and in agricultural water; (3) under-utilization of capacities in hydraulic equipment; (4) siltation of dams and reservoirs; and, (5) multidimensional dependence on foreign economies. This nation-wide policy is characterized by a lack of institutional coordination and many multi-level governance gaps. This paper demonstrates that water policy in Algeria is in the transitional phase. The present challenge is to reduce the duration of this transition to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) in particular the SDG 6.","['math', 'sde', 'shs']"
MT-RPL: a cross-layer approach for mobility support in RPL,"Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are inherently dynamic-nodes move or experience link perturbations. Routing packets in LLNs is generally performed by the IETF IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). To face the dynamics of LLN, RPL is helped by external mechanisms such as Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) or Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD). In this article, we focus our analysis on mobility support. We first show that NUD and BFD fail to mitigate node disconnection. We therefore propose a new cross-layer protocol operating between the MAC and routing layers known as Mobility-Triggered RPL (MT-RPL). MT-RPL has been implemented in Contiki OS and is evaluated together with NUD and BFD through an extensive experimentation campaign. Results show that our solution significantly reduces the disconnection time, which increases the packet delivery ratio from the mobile node to the root and reduces control traffic in the network.",['info']

"Carbazole-based polymers as hosts for solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes: simplicity, efficacy","Polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs) have attracted a great deal of interest within academia and industry because of their potential applications in flat panel displays and solid-state lighting technologies. The solution processability of polymers offers the advantages of simple and mild fabrication conditions enabling to cut cost and produce large area displays. Among all polymeric hosts under investigation, carbazole-based materials benefit from the wide bandgap of carbazole as well as its remarkable thermal, photochemical and chemical stability. Especially, the relatively high triplet energy level of carbazole makes it an appealing candidate to design hosts for wide bandgap triplet emitters such as blue dopants. In this review, an overview of all carbazole-based polymeric hosts reported to date is presented. Noticeably, easiness of synthesis has been an aspect largely developed to access to these polymeric structures",['chim']

Moreover, their properties along the perpendicular direction can be described by continuous, slowly-varying functions. Hence, these objects can be treated as shells with a functionally graded structure. Here, the tolerance model of these shells is proposed.",['spi']
2D modelling of thin skeletonal elastic shallow shells,The subject of this contribution is a certain thin skeletonal elastic shallow shell. The aim of analysis is to derive and apply a 2D-macroscopic model for shallow shells with the non-uniformly oscillating microstructure. The main feature of the proposed mathematical model is that the microstructure length parameter λ is similar compared to thickness δ of the shell ( λ ≅ δ ).The formulation of approximate mathematical model of these shells is based on a tolerance averaging approximation [5]. The general results of the contribution will be illustrated by the analysis of a specific problem,['spi']

Soil organic matter of forests and climate and atmosphere changesMatières organiques des sols forestiers et changements climatique et atmosphérique,"Soil organic matter is the largest carbon reservoir of the terrestrial ecosystems and is a main driver of soil fertility. Its evolution driven by climate and atmosphere changes is a main issue in the medium and the long term, on a global scale and on a local scale. We present a literature synthesis on this topic, focused on forest SOM. The main study methods are the comparisons of soil inventories, the interpretation of spatial correlations with climate into temporal trends, the monitoring of the inputs and outputs of soil carbon in forest as well as in laboratory, and a diversity of models that link the knowledge’s and foresee the evolutions of SOMs. The results confirm that a decrease in SOM content is to be expected sooner or later in the boreal and temperate forests, due to the global warming. However, nitrogen deposition has a positive effect on SOM storage, which is not yet included in the carbon models at a global scale. In addition, the free air carbon dioxide experiments (FACE) could not detect any change in SOM storage up to now, but it is likely that positive effects will occur later. Qualitatively, nitrogen deposition and warming are reducing the limitation of fertility by nitrogen, and it is expected that phosphorus limitation will become relatively more important.La matière organique des sols (MOS) constitue le plus grand réservoir de carbone des écosystèmes terrestres et elle est une composante majeure de la fertilité. Son évolution sous l’impact des changements atmosphériques et climatiques est porteuse d’enjeux essentiels à moyen et long terme, à l’échelle globale comme à l’échelle locale. Nous présentons ici une synthèse des connaissances sur cette évolution des MOS dans les forêts. Les principales méthodes d’étude sont les comparaisons d’inventaires pédologiques, l’interprétation de corrélations spatiales avec le climat en tendances temporelles, les suivis expérimentaux en laboratoire ou en forêt des flux d’entrée et de sortie du carbone dans le sol, et toute une gamme de modèles visant à assembler ces connaissances et à prédire l’évolution des MOS. Les résultats confirment qu’il faut s’attendre à plus ou moins long terme à un appauvrissement en MOS, dû au réchauffement, dans les forêts boréales et tempérées. Cependant, les dépôts azotés ont un effet positif sur le stockage de matière organique dans le sol, qui n’est pas encore intégré dans les modèles terrestres à l’échelle globale. Enfin, les expérimentations d’enrichissement de l’air en CO2 en forêt n’ont pour l’instant pas d’effet sur le stockage de carbone dans le sol, mais on peut s’attendre à des effets positifs à plus long terme. Sur le plan qualitatif, les dépôts azotés et le réchauffement contribuent à réduire la limitation de la fertilité par l’azote, et il est prévisible que la limitation par le phosphore gagne en importance relative.","['sdv', 'sde']"
GPU-Based Lighting and Shadowing of Complex Natural Scenes,"Rendering realistic natural scenes in real-time is a challenging topic in the field of computer graphics. More specifically, we want to render scenes that contain complex shapes bounded in a layer above a surface. Landscapes (e.g., terrain, vegetation) are examples of such scenes. Lightings and shadows are essential elements toward realism because they help understanding shapes. However: - Using polygonal meshes and classical shadowing algorithms are too costly in terms of computation for complex scenes; - Adapted algorithms for dedicated representations such height-fields are efficient, but these representations are too limited for our needs (e.g. forest); - Although more powerful representations like surfels or texels exist, algorithms for quality and efficient lighting and shadowing are not available yet. Thus, our goal is to propose lighting and shadowing techniques adapted to such representations as well as the GPU.",['info']

Semi-Interactive Morphogenesis,"This poster (for the paper, see SMI'06) presents a method to simulate growth phenomena, and its application to the modeling of complex organic shapes (e.g., plants organs) and folded surfaces. Our main contribution is the interactive and stable resolution of the mechanical problem of growth-induced deformations, based on the minimization of the energy due to the various constraints in the shell. From this, we propose a new modeling approach based on a set of growing tools: The user can apply 'hot spots', 'hot curves', or paint growing parameters on the surface to grow. Growth can be simulated either simultaneously to the user interaction, or once all parameters have been settled on the surface (which allows the use of textures of parameters and procedural operations). The main parameters are the intensity and anisotropy of growth, as well as their variations over time. Geometric constraints and plasticity can also be considered. As our results show shapes can fold, bend, and curl as in nature, which deforming tools such as displacement map could not achieve. We demonstrate our tool with an interactive session and a gallery of shapes easily produced.Ce poster (pour le papier, voir SMI'06) presente une methode permettant de simuler des phenomenes de croissance, ainsi que ses applications pour la modelisation de formes organiques complexes ou des surface plissees. Notre principale contribution est la resolution stable et en temps interactif du probleme mecanique des deformations induites par la croissance, grace a la minimisation de l'energie des contraintes qui s'appliquent a une coque. Nous proposons une nouvelle approche de la modelisation basee sur un ensemble d'outils de croissance: l'utilisateur peut appliquer des 'points chauds', des 'contrours de croissance' ou peindre directement les parametres de croissance sur la surface. La croissance peut etre simulee soit simultanement aux interactions de l'utilisateur, soit une fois que tous les parametres aient ete fixes sur la surface (ce qui autorise l'utilisation d'une texture de ces parametres ainsi que les operations procedurales). Les principaux parametres sont l'intensite et l'anisotropie de la croissance, ainsi que leurs variations au cours de temps. On peut egalement tenir compte de la plasticite ainsi que de contraintes geometriques. Comme le montre nos resultats, les formes peuvent se plisser, plier ou se tordre (comme dans la nature), ce que des outils de deformations bases sur des cartes de deplacements ne peuvent reussir de maniere simple.",['info']
A Language for the Specification of Administrative Workflow Processes with Emphasis on Actors’ Views,"Administrative workflows refer to variable business processes in which all cases are known; tasks are predictable and their sequencing rules are simple and clearly defined. When such processes are collaboratively executed by several actors, it may be desirable, for security reasons (confidentiality), that each of them has at all times, only a partial perception (this is what we call ""actor's view"") of the current process state. This concern seems sufficiently important to be considered when specifying such workflows. However, traditional workflow specification languages (BPMN, BPEL, YAWL) only partially address it. This is why we present in this paper, a new language for specifying administrative workflows that allows us not only to simply model all of the processes tasks and their sequence, but also and especially to explicitly express the rights of the various actors with respect to each of them, in order to guarantee a certain degree of security. The proposed model is an executable grammatical specification that allows to express using decorated productions, the different types of basic flows (sequential, parallel, alternative and iterative) that are found in workflow specification languages; moreover, it also allows to specify the rights of each actor in each process and on its data in a formalism similar to that used in UNIX-like operating systems.",['info']

A Grammatical Model for the Specification of Administrative Workflow Using Scenario as Modelling Unit,"Process modelling is a crucial phase of Business Process Management (BPM). Despite the many efforts made in producing process modelling tools, existing tools (languages) are not commonly accepted. They are mainly criticised for their inability to specify both the tasks making up the processes and their scheduling (their lifecycle models), the data they manipulate (their information models) and their organizational models. Process modelling in these languages often results in a single task graph; such a graph can quickly become difficult to read and maintain. Moreover, these languages are often too general (they have a very high expressiveness); this makes their application to specific types of processes complex: especially for administrative processes. In this paper, we present a new language for administrative processes modelling that allows designers to specify the lifecycle, information and organizational models of such processes using a mathematical tool based on a variant of attributed grammars. The approach imposed by the new language requires the designer to subdivide his process into scenarios, then to model each scenario individually using a simple task graph (an annotated tree) from which a grammatical model is further derived. At each moment then, the designer manipulates only a scenario of the studied process: this approach is more intuitive and modular; it allows to produce task graphs that are more refined and therefore, more readable and easier to maintain.",['info']
Revenue-capped efficient auctions,"We study an auction that maximizes the expected social surplus under an upper-bound constraint on the seller’s expected revenue, which we call a revenue cap. Such a constrained-efficient auction may arise, for example, when (i) the auction designer is “pro-buyer”, that is, he maximizes the weighted sum of the buyers’ and seller’s auction payoffs, where the weight for the buyers is greater than that for the seller; (ii) the auction designer maximizes the (unweighted) total surplus in a multiunit auction in which the number of units the seller owns is private information; or (iii) multiple sellers compete to attract buyers before the auction. We characterize the mechanisms for constrained-efficient auctions and identify their important properties. First, the seller sets no reserve price and sells the good for sure. Second, with a nontrivial revenue cap, “bunching” is necessary. Finally, with a sufficiently severe revenue cap, the constrained-efficient auction has a bid cap, so that bunching occurs at least “at the top,” that is, “no distortion at the top” fails.",['shs']
Risk aversion and the value of diagnostic tests,"Diagnostic tests allow better informed medical decisions when there is uncertainty about a patient’s health status and, therefore, about the desirability to undertake treatment. This paper studies the relation between the expected value of diagnostic information and a patient's risk aversion.

On the other hand, the ex post value of diagnostic information always increases with the patient's degree of risk aversion.",['shs']

"Using GMT for 2D and 3D Modeling of the Ryukyu Trench Topography, Pacific Ocean","This research focuses on the 2D and 3D geospatial analysis of the Ryukyu Trench, a deep-sea trench located in the western Pacific Ocean between Japan and Taiwan. The aim of the research is to visualize regional differences in the topography of the southern (S) and northern (N) parts of the trench. Technically, the methodology is based on using the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) scripting toolset, for modelling the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO), and Earth Topography and Bathymetry dataset (ETOPO1) raster grids. The results demonstrated topographic differences in the two segments. The most frequent depths lie between-5,000 and-6,000 m. The N part has steeper gradient slopes and deeper bathymetry. Of the depth differences >-6,000 m, S has nine values with depths >-6,800 m while N shows 123 records (max-7,460 m). The submarine terraces of S have gentler slopes compared with the N segment. The technical approach presents GMT-based 2D and 3D cartographic modelling aimed at visualizing regional variations of the seafloor topography.","['info', 'math', 'sde', 'phys']"
Fostering Attachment Security: The Role of Interdependent Situations,"This work adopts an Interdependence Theory framework to investigate how the features of interdependent situations that couples face in their daily life (i.e., situations in which partners influence each other’s outcomes) shape attachment security toward their current partners. An experience sampling study examined attachment tendencies and features of interdependent situations that people experience with their partner in daily life to predict satisfaction and trust in their relationship, and changes in attachment avoidance and anxiety toward their partner over time. Results revealed that encountering situations with corresponding outcomes (i.e., situations in which both partners have the same preferences) and with information certainty (i.e., situations in which there is clear knowledge of each partner’s preferences) assuage people’s insecurity. On the contrary, situations of mutual current and future interdependence (i.e., situations in which each person’s current or future outcomes are dependent on their partner’s behavior) undermined security for anxiously attached individuals. Power (i.e., the asymmetry in partners’ dependence) was not related to attachment security. This work underscores the importance of studying the role of the situations that partners experience in their daily life and the way they are related to relationship feelings and cognitions.",['shs']

Assigning Objects to Classes of a Euclidean Ascending Hierarchical Clustering,"In a Euclidean ascending hierarchical clustering (AHC, Ward's method), the usual method for allocating a supplementary object to a cluster is based on the geometric distance from the object-point to the barycenter of the cluster. The main drawback of this method is that it does not take into consideration that clusters differ as regards weights, shapes and dispersions. Neither does it take into account successive dichotomies of the hierarchy of classes. This is why we propose a new ranking rule adapted to geometric data analysis that takes the shape of clusters into account. From a set of supplementary objects, we propose a strategy for assigning these objects to clusters stemming from an AHC. The idea is to assign supplementary objects at the local level of a node to one of its two successors until a cluster of the partition under study is reached. We define a criterion based on the ratio of Mahalanobis distances from the object--point to barycenters of the two clusters that make up the node. We first introduce the principle of the method, and we apply it to a barometric survey carried out by the CEVIPOF on various components of trust among French citizens. We compare the evolution of clusters of individuals between 2009 and 2012 then 2013.","['math', 'shs']"
Asymmetric Mean Reversion in Low Liquid Markets: Evidence from BRVM,"This paper analyzes the mean reversion property on the west African stock market (in French, Bourse Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières BRVM). For this purpose, we use two daily indices: (i) the composite index (BRVMC) and (ii) the index of the 10 most liquid assets (BRVM10) collected from 3 January 2005 to 29 June 2018. We estimate an asymmetric nonlinear autoregressive model with an EGARCH innovation to account for heteroskedasticity. The results suggest the existence of a mean reversion property for both indices. The half-life time is 7 days for the composite index and 2 days for the BRVM 10 index. Furthermore, using a rolling regression technique, we show that the estimated half-life time declines slightly for the composite index.","['math', 'shs']"
"Influence of Tidal Inlets on Tsunami Waves in the Atlantic (Charente Region, France)","The French Atlantic coast seismicity is minor to moderate. Nevertheless, in western (north and central) part of France, the active tectonics related to the south Armorican and the Bay of Biscay context results sometimes in shallow earthquakes with magnitude above five (e.g., the Oleron seismic crisis, magnitude (local) = 5.2, 1972). The Charente region is featured by semi-diurnal tides that reach about six meters in height during the high tide period. Inlets are the main features of the Atlantic margin geomorphology nearby the Charente. Minor tsunamis have been observed and reported in the past. Here, we present a tsunami modelling computed with the TELEMAC package that solves the non linear shallow water equations. This work helps to identify the role of the inlets that characterize the Charente’s geomorphology on water wave’s propagation. A tidal model is considered while the tsunami simulation is performed. The modelling results show that the Antioche, the Maumusson and the Pertuis inlets protect the Charente coast from destructive waves.",['phys']
Refutation of the theorie of gases greenhouse,"There is an area in the atmosphere called the tropopause where the temperature is constant and equal to-56.5 ° C on a thickness of a few kilometers 1. The heat transfer can make it only at constant temperature: single the radiative effect and the phase change of a pure substance are then possible.The blackbody radiation laws thus apply, including the law Stefan says that the radiated energy depend only on the absolute temperature. To-56.5° C, so this one is 120W / m2 2. The tropopause causes an effect greenhouse for radiation absorbed and re-emitted by the black body to its temperature. This radiation upwards as downwards therefore need a total energy of 240W / m2 to guarantee the duration of the phenomenon. That's about that measured at the surface of the Earth from the sun 3. On the other hand, the existence for millions of years with a temperature relatively constant on Earth imposes an almost balance between the solar energy received and that emitted to space by the tropopause. As the energy irradiated in space can not exceed 120W / m2 legislated Stefan, energy solar received continuously is only 120W / m2 instead of 240W / m2. This",['phys']
Theoretical and Conceptual Framework for Digital Inclusion among Mathematics Education Students in Nigeria,"The term digital inclusion has been used to articulate the policy, research and practical efforts to look beyond issues of access to computers and the Internet and toward a more robust understanding of the skills, content and services needed to support individuals, families and communities in their abilities to truly adopt computers and the internet.

This present review examines the theoretical and conceptual foundations of digital inclusion in light of developmental realities in Nigeria. Specifically, this review considers the framework for inquiry into the technological divide, the new psychological model of e-adoption within the context of the digital divide, the three-step path to engaging with the internet, and a model of digital literacy. The review also considers key conceptual definitions of digital inclusion, the stages of digital inclusion, and approaches to measuring digital inclusion.

"Old Dog, New Tricks: Innocent, Five-coordinate Cyanocobalt Corroles","Three mono-CN ligated anionic cobalt A3-triarylcorroles were synthesized and investigated as to their spectroscopic and electrochemical properties in CH2Cl2, pyridine (Py), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The newly synthesized corroles provide the first examples of air-stable cobalt corroles with an anionic axial ligand and are represented as [(Ar)3CorCoIII(CN)]−TBA+, where Cor is the trivalent corrole macrocycle, Ar is p-(CN)Ph, p-(CF3)Ph, or p-(OMe)Ph, and TBA+ is the tetra-n-butylammonium (TBA) cation. Multiple redox reactions are observed for each mono-CN derivative with a key feature being a more facile first oxidation and a more difficult first reduction in all three solvents as compared to all previously examined corroles with similar meso- and β-pyrrole substituents. Formation constants (log K) for conversion of the five-coordinate mono-CN complex to its six-coordinate bis-CN form ranged from 102.8 for Ar = p-(OMe)Ph to 104.7 for Ar = p-(CN)Ph in DMSO as determined by spectroscopic methodologies. The in situ generated bis-CN complexes, represented as [(Ar)3CorCoIII(CN)2]2–(TBA+)2, and the mixed ligand complexes, represented as [(Ar)3CorCoIII(CN)(Py)]−TBA+, were also investigated as to their electrochemical and spectroscopic properties. UV–visible spectra and electrode reactions of the synthesized mono-CN derivatives are compared with the neutral mono-DMSO cobalt corrole complexes and the in situ generated bis-CN and bis-Py complexes, and the noninnocent (or innocent) nature of each cobalt corrole system is addressed. The data demonstrate the ability of the CN– axial ligand(s) to stabilize the high-valent forms of the metallocorrole, leading to systems with innocent macrocyclic ligands. Although a number of six-coordinate cobalt(III) corroles with N-donor ligands were characterized in the solid state, a dissociation of one axial ligand readily occurs in nonaqueous solvents, and this behavior contrasts with the high stability of the currently studied bis-CN adducts in CH2Cl2, pyridine, or DMSO. Linear free energy relationships were elucidated between the meso-phenyl Hammett substituent constants (Σσ) and the measured binding constants, the redox potentials, and the energy of the band positions in the mono-CN and bis-CN complexes in their neutral or singly oxidized forms, revealing highly predictable trends in the physicochemical properties of the anionic corroles.",['spi']
Comparison of inversion models of wind speed retrieval from C-band Sentinel-1 and X-band TerraSAR-X data,"Retrieval of sea surface wind speed from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is one of the most widely used methods, since it can give higher resolutions than the other available surface wind sources. For this approach, two principal methods can be found: one is based on electromagnetic (EM) models and the other is based on empirical (EP) ones. In both indicated ways, the Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) are used to describe the dependency of radar scattering on wind speed and the geometry of observations. By knowing radar scattering and geometric parameters from SAR data, it is possible to invert the GMFs to retrieve sea wind speed. Wind speed estimated by two studied models is compared together and evaluated with measured data. Based on the comparisons, the advantages and limits of the studied models are analyzed and discussed.",['spi']

Review of the late-Holocene storm events along the European Atlantic coasts,"The chronology of the late-Holocene coastal storms was reconstructed from vibracore samplings, radiocarbon dating and sedimentary analysis from Yeu island (French Atlantic coast). The methodology used is based on the identification of disturbing sedimentary events recognized within three Holocene sedimentary transgressive sequences selected along the northern coast of the island. These sequences correspond to the present-day coastal salt-marshes and swamps. The sediment cores were centimeter-sampled and studied from several sedimentological proxies (Loss of Ignition, sand fraction, mean grain size) with a high temporal resolution. Chronology was built by age-depth model based on eleven 14C measures of organic sediments and shell samples. Nine paleo-storm events were recorded: a 2100-1950 calBP interval as a deeply stormy-disturbed period; five others major impacted times: 600-500 calBP, 2850-2350 calBP, 3500-3270 calBP, 5400-5370 calBP and 6650-6510 calBP; and three final less meaningful storminess hypothesis near 1590 calBP, 7000 calBP, and between 7670 and 7470 calBP. This chronology was compared with enhanced storminess periods recognized along the European Atlantic coast. Six stormy periods stand out from the last 8000 years: 600-300 BP, 1700-1100 BP, 2900-2500 BP, 3500-3300 BP, 5500-5100 BP and 7700-7100 BP, corresponding to late Holocene global cold events. These results suggests that these changes in coastal hydrodynamics were in phase with those identified over the North-eastern Atlantic and seem to correspond to Holocene cooling first shown in the North Atlantic and associated with decreases in sea surface temperature.","['shs', 'sde', 'phys']"

How does climate change make fish late for dinner?Quand il faut plus chaud les poissons sont-ils en retard à la cantine ?,"Imagine you are a young and hungry fish looking for food in an estuary (the part of a river where it meets the ocean). You need to grow big and strong before you migrate to the ocean, and depend on tiny floating creatures (plankton) for food. However, the occurrence of these tiny creatures in the estuary varies seasonally. Lucky for you, nature has synchronized both your time in the estuary and that of your prey, and you survive. This synchronization depends on many different factors, among them the temperature of the water. Now imagine someone turning up the heat (like we humans are doing by changing the climate). Could the rising water temperatures mess up the timing for you, the predator, and your prey? To answer this question we looked at climate related changes in the synchronization of predator and prey in the biggest estuary in Western Europe. And indeed, we found signs of temporal mismatches in its aquatic food web. We fear that the observed changes can put this important ecosystem and its role as a big fish nursery at risk.Imagine que tu sois un poisson jeune et affamé à la recherche de nourriture dans un estuaire (la partie d'une rivière où elle rencontre l'océan). Tu dois devenir grand et fort avant de nager vers l'océan, et tu dépends de minuscules animaux flottants : le plancton pour manger. Cependant, la présence de ces créatures dans l'estuaire varie selon les saisons. Heureusement pour toi, la nature a fait en sorte que tu sois dans l'estuaire en même temps que ton repas et donc tu survivras (on parle alors de synchronisation). Cette synchronisation dépend néanmoins de nombreux paramètres, comme la température de l'eau. Maintenant, imagine que quelqu'un fasse monter cette température (comme nous, les humains, en changeant le climat). Cette augmentation de la température peut-elle perturber ton calendrier et celui des animaux que tu manges (tes proies) ? Pour répondre à la question, nous avons examiné la synchronisation de plusieurs espèces de poissons (prédateurs) avec celle de leurs proies dans le plus grand estuaire d'Europe occidentale (La Gironde) et son lien avec le changement du climat.

Tout change quand des armes de guerre sont disponibles qui peuvent détruire, même plusieurs fois, tous les êtres humains ou toute la vie sur la terre. Sous la force des circonstances, le droit de faire la guerre est remplacé par une obligatio pacis, une obligation de maintenir la paix. Parmi plusieurs détenteurs de pouvoir c’est l’Etat qui est, tout d’abord, censé veiller sur la sécurité des citoyens du point de vue national, international, planétaire. Dans sa tâche difficile l’Etat doit s’allier à toutes les forces qui peuvent aider, y compris les traditions religieuses. Parmi elles, les religions missionnaires acceptent leurs adhérents non seulement par hérédité ou par tradition, mais aussi par conversion. Elles sont ainsi capables de véhiculer le pouvoir politique à un niveau transnational, et cela, comme plus que 2000 ans de l’histoire du Bouddhisme, du Christianisme et de l’Islam le montre, de façon puissante. Les concepts de base étaient pourtant acceptés et interprétés dans les premiers siècles de ces religions, quand les armes de destruction modernes n’étaient ni disponibles ni imaginables. Nous énumérons ensuite trois traditions récentes et actuelles inspirées par le Coran qui adhèrent, pour cette raison et pour d’autres, explicitement à la non-violence.",['shs']

Self-consistent modelling of heterogeneous materials with an elastic-viscoplastic behavior: Application to polycrystalline agregates,"The self-consistent scheme is a common homogenization method that was developed to connect local deformation mechanisms to the overall behavior of heterogeneous disordered materials. In the past decades, many efforts have been made to obtain extensions of the self-consistent approximation to the non-linear case. This work focuses on the specific case of heterogeneous materials with an elastic-viscoplastic behavior. For such materials, the overall behavior is strongly dependent on the space-time couplings originating from the differential form of the local constitutive law. Different approaches have thus been developed to describe the impact of such complex couplings on the overall behavior. (...)",['spi']
A dynamic maintenance decision approach based on maintenance action grouping for HVAC maintenance costs savings in non-residential buildings,"Huge maintenance costs in non-residential buildings weighted it down the overall costs allocated to HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) system maintenance. Maintenance Management objective is to reduce or even avoid the corrective maintenance by proper planning and implementation of maintenance tasks at the right time. The aim of this paper is to early plan maintenance interventions for a multi-components system based on stoppages characteristics, system RUL (Remaining Useful Life) and components criticalities. This maintenance plan is made through a dynamic maintenance decision approach (DMDA) to help the maintenance expert in taking decision. Since combining maintenance activities is cheaper than performing maintenance on components separately, maintenance actions groupings are performed in the proposed approach by the mean of odds algorithm. This will allow optimizing system availability, reducing maintenance costs and delaying as late as possible maintenance interventions. Components criticalities are used for prioritizing components in the grouping process. Moreover, DMDA take into account predictive information such as system/components RUL, given by an existing prognostic process. At the end, a numerical example of a HVAC system with five components (Heat exchanger, filter, dampers, valve and fan) demonstrates the use and the advantages of the proposed DMDA.",['spi']
Vegetarian diets and health: the voice of science needs to be heard,"Are vegetarian diets the key to healthy aging, or could they be a health risk? These questions are a source of confusion for the general public, and for many scientists too. Why? Nutrition is a complex discipline and it struggles to provide simple answers to issues as broad as the relationships between a range of dietary practices and health outcomes. Are vegetarian diets good or bad? Can we tweet the answer in 140 characters or less? You can add to this intrinsic problem the general trend of society, with less-qualified messengers relaying information that is fragmented and often biased, misinterpreted or indeed uninterpretable. Many viewpoints are advanced, but few reflect any consensus between experts, in particular those from national advisory committees – for example, in France, the United States) and internationally. Even reliable media may highlight a particular study without referring to the hundreds that preceded it. Our diet and the clash of politics and philosophy In this general context, why is vegetarianism subject to so many radically opposed points of view? Beyond being a major societal debate, it’s also a highly politicised one. Pure and impartial science is not fashionable, and cannot be heard above the din of clashing and frequently uninformed views. The fact is that consumption of animal protein has doubled since the end of World War II, but today questions are being raised about the food model of industrialised societies – they are seen as having degraded public health and being unsustainable, particularly in the face of global warning. An underlying reason for our reluctance to deal with these issues is that the consumption of animal products has always been associated with our representations of the world. Vegetarianism is an “ism”. Religions and a number of philosophies have long maintained special relations with the consumption of animal products. To speak of eliminating meat from our diet is to bring into question the representation of man in the universe. It’s also about the place of animals in society, a relationship that has evolved over time. In societies in development, animal products were costly but useful and favoured by those with the economic resources, but we have now entered an era where they’ve become objects of distrust and in some cases symbols of a societal model being called into question. The effect of animal products on the environment or on health, the fight on behalf of defenceless animals… our ethical and aesthetic views are evolving. So should we be for or against animal products? The battle lines are being drawn. Even within the scientific community, rational thinking seems to disappear when the question is raised. But this subject is too important for scientific research to be ignored. Food transitions in western countries seem inevitable, and are in fact already under way. For those who wish to reduce their meat consumption for personal reasons, the question is not “Should I become vegetarian or vegan?” but “How can I become a vegetarian or vegan?” “How” involves understanding the nutritional pitfalls involved and how they can best be avoided – in other words, what is the healthiest version of the desired diet?",['sdv']

Computing and Plotting Correlograms by Python and R Libraries for Correlation Analysis of the Environmental Data in Marine Geomorphology,"The geomorphology of the Mariana Trench, the deepest ocean trench on the Earth, has a complex character: its transverse profile is asymmetric, the slopes are higher on the side of the Mariana island arc. The shape of the Mariana Trench is a strongly elongated, arched in plan and lesser rectilinear depression. The slopes of the trench are dissected by deep underwater canyons with various narrow steps on the slopes of various shapes and sizes, caused by active tectonic and sedimentation processes. Understanding of factors that may affect the shape of the geomorphology of such complex structure requires advanced methods of numerical computing. Current research is focused on the analysis of the geomorphology of the Mariana Trench by application of statistical libraries embedded in Python and R programming languages for the data analysis. Workflow algorithms include processing a data set by analysis, computing and visual plotting of the graphs. The research aims is to understand the environmental interactions affecting submarine geomorphology of the Mariana Trench by statistical data analysis. Technically, used algorithms included libraries of Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, SciPy and NumPy) and libraries of R ({hexbin}, {ggally}, {ggplot2}). Technically, following types of the statistical analysis were tested for computing and plotting: correlograms, histograms, strip plots, ridgeline plots and hexagonal diagrams for the bathymetric and geomorphic analysis. Python, being a high-level language, shown more straightforward approach for the statistical data analysis, while R implies more power in the data visualization. The results of the geospatial data modelling show detected correlation between various factors (geology, bathymetry, tectonics) affecting submarine geomorphology that reveal unevenness in its structure. Both programming languages demonstrated significant functionality for the spatial data analysis. The effective and accurate geospatial data visualization demonstrated by Python and R proves high potential of their application in the geomorphological studies.","['info', 'phys']"
Allometric models to estimate the aboveground biomass of tropical highlands savannahs trees.,"Le développement des équations allométriques des arbres est crucial pour une évaluation précise du carbone de la savane. En Afrique, l’absence des équations allométriques multi-espèces pour les écosystèmes de la savane a conduit à une large utilisation des équations pour estimer la biomasse des arbres des forêts tropicales humides. L’objectif de cette étude était de développer des régressions allométriques multi-espèces précises pour estimer la biomasse aérienne des arbres dans les savanes des Hautes Terres de l’Ouest Cameroun. Les données de la biomasse aérienne des ligneux ont été obtenues à partir des échantillons destructifs de 103 arbres appartenant à 7 espèces dans une gamme de diamètre (5-38 cm). La biomasse aérienne variait de 6,19 kg pour le plus petit arbre à 669,45 kg pour le plus grand arbre. Les relations proportionnelles entre la biomasse aérienne et le diamètre à hauteur de poitrine (DHP) ont été construites à partir de huit modèles de régression (linéaire, croissance, composé, exponentiel, quadratique, cubique, puissance et logarithmique). Les meilleurs modèles ont été sélectionnés en utilisant les coefficients de détermination (R²) et l’erreur relative. Les meilleurs modèles locaux multi-espèces utilisant uniquement le diamètre comme variable d’entrée étaient des régressions quadratiques et cubiques avec respectivement un R² de 0,914 et 0,917. Le modèle quadratique surestime la biomasse avec un biais de 0,04 % alors que le modèle cubique la sous-estime avec un biais de 0,012 %. Dans cette étude, les deux équations allométriques multi-espèces développée pour les savanes peuvent être utilisée pour produire des estimations précises des stocks de biomasse et de carbone à partir de la mesure du diamètre des données d’inventaire forestier.",['sde']

Over the last decade, a few developmental studies have started addressing this issue, both in human infants and infants of non-human species. Here, I review the available data from both the developmental literature and some of my own work that address the inherited, experience-based and social factors influencing the emergence of tool use in several species.

"GMT Based Comparative Analysis and Geomorphological Mapping of the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches, Southwest Pacific Ocean","Current study is focused on the GMT based modelling of the two hadal trenches located in southwest Pacific Ocean, eastwards from Australia: Tonga and Kermadec. Due to its inaccessible location, the seafloor of the deep-sea trench can only be visualized using remote sensing tools and advanced algorithms of data analysis. The importance of the developing and technical improving of the innovative methods in cartographic data processing is indisputable. Automatization in data analysis has been significantly increased over the past years. However, using programming and scripting in cartography still remains lower comparing to the use of the traditional GIS. Therefore, developing GMT-based methods for the geomorphological data processing is crucial for better understanding the landforms of the seafloor. Methodology includes application of the GMT scripting toolset for the automated digitizing of the profiles crossing the trenches in perpendicular direction. A sequence of the GMT codes enabled to visualize raster and vector data, perform geomorphological modelling, descriptive statistical data analysis and quantitative comparison of the two trenches. Using GMT, the bathymetric sample data of the Kermadec and Tonga trenches were modeled, analyzed and compared. The results show deeper bathymetry and more seafloor roughness for the Tonga. Comparing to Kermadec, Tonga Trench has steeper gradient of the profiles. The seafloor geomorphology is strongly affected by a variety of factors that shape actual form of both trenches. The experimental methodology is fully based on the GMT scripting with presented and explained codes.","['sde', 'phys']"

Optimizing a Sensor Deployment with Network Constraints Computable by Costly Requests,"This paper deals with the planning of networked sensors. In such sensors deployment, two main aspects have to be considered: cover most strategic areas, and ensure the connectivity between sensors and network nodes. The connectivity is computed by expensive simulations, and these computation requests should be optimized as an experiment design in order to enhance the constraint models, while the sensor deployment itself is solved by usual optimizer. We propose a simulated approach, inspired from the known algorithm, EGO, in order to address this two-level problem.",['spi']
The Sociological Discourse on Inequality and Social Class in France,"Over the past three decades social inequality has grown in France, as in many other countries. Paradoxically, however, during that same period the dominant discourse concerning French society, both in the social sciences and politics, has largely tended to conceal this growing social polarization and to eliminate any reference to class. Indeed, since the beginning of the 1980s, sociologists and politicians have vied with one another to invent clever words and expressions to describe the structure of French society. However, these substitute discourses were soon gainsaid by the growing social disparities prevalent within French society, and which existed in spite of the rhetoric which obstinately denied the reality of class within French society. Indeed, in France, the notion of ‘class’ had, at best, changed and become more complex, but remained as present as ever. This chapter will, first, explain the background to this increasing social polarization of French society. This polarization is of course not unique to France, and can be found in varying degrees in most capitalist countries in Western Europe. The widening wage gap has had clear consequences for all significant aspects of people’s lives, and a number of indicators converge which allow us to expose this tendency, and demonstrate the existence of a system of inequality characterized by segmentation, hierarchization and conflict. After this initial presentation, some thoughts will be put forward on the words and categories that are used in certain sociological theoretical frameworks. This alternative sociological discourse was pervasive between 1980 and 2000 and continues to be used today, even though it has long since been largely refuted by the facts. This chapter will focus in particular on the discrepancy between the rhetoric of these theories, which deny the existence of ‘social class’ within France — and the undeniable reality of a growing polarization within French society.",['shs']

Application of metamodel-based techniques for the efficient seismic analysis of structural systems,"We look at the (failure) behavior of structural systems under the occurrence of seismic events. Detailed, long-running Finite Element Models (FEMs) are typically adopted for the simulation of the system structural response. However, since a very large number of simulations (e.g., several thousands) is usually required for an accurate assessment of the system failure behavior under different seismic conditions, the computational burden associated to the approach may be at times impractical. To address this issue, we resort to (fast-running) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regression models, optimally trained to approximate the response of the original FEM. In particular, we embrace a wrapper approach based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization to search for the optimal set of model inputs (features) that maximize the ANN representation accuracy. The ANN is trained, validated and tested with respect to the optimal feature subset identified; then, the results are compared with those produced by the original FEM. We illustrate the approach on a case study of seismic risk assessment involving the estimation of the fragility curves for a masonry structure.","['math', 'spi']"

What if we considered awareness for sustainable Kwowledge Management ? Towards a model for self regulated knowledge management systems based on acceptance models of technologies and awareness,"We propose, in this paper, a model of continuous use of corporate collaborative KMS. Companies do not always have the guaranty that their KMS will be continuously used. This statement can constitute an important obstacle for knowledge management processes. Our work is based on the analysis of classical models for initial and continuous use of technologies. We also analyse the regulation concept and explain how it is valuable to support a continuous use of KMS. We observed that awareness may be a regulation means that allows taking this problem into account. Awareness is a concept, which has been profusely used to improve user experience in collaborative environments. It is an important element for regulation of activity. In our model, we assume that one can integrate awareness in information systems to positively influence beliefs about them. The final objective of our work is to refine some concepts to fit the particularities of collaborative KMS and to propose an awareness regulation process using the traces of the users' interactions with the systems.","['scco', 'info']"
A multi-scale approach of roughness measurements: Evaluation of the relevant scale,"This paper proposes a new multi-scale measurement approach performed to compare the surface roughness and the visual aspect of polished surfaces. In this investigation, five specimens of glass moulds presenting different visual aspects are considered. All roughness profiles assessed by tactile profilometry were rectified by a first degree polynomial fitting, and current roughness parameters were calculated with respect to the evaluation length among which they are estimated. A variance analysis was then performed to discriminate each roughness parameter and each evaluation length with regard to a correlation with the visual aspect. Although the average roughness amplitude is about 100 nm, the results show that the optimal correlation with the visual aspect is obtained for a 400 μm evaluation length. Moreover, the multi-scale method allows to confirm results already found in the bibliography about the high wavelengths origin of “orange peel” aspect. This application allowed us to conclude on the advantages and the limits of the implemented method.","['math', 'spi']"

The measurement problem on classical diffusion process: inverse method on stochastic processes,"In a high number of diffusive systems, measures are processed to calculate material parameters such as diffusion coefficients, or to verify the accuracy of mathematical models. However, the precision of the parameter determination or of the model relevance depends on the location of the measure itself. The aim of this paper is first to analyse, for a mono-dimensional system, the precision of the measure in relation with its location by an inverse problem algorithm and secondly to examine the physical meaning of the results. Statistical mechanic considerations show that, passing over a time–distance criterion, measurement becomes uncertain whatever the initial conditions. The criterion proves that this chaotic mode is related to the production of anti-entropy at a mesoscopique scale that is in violation to quantum theory about measurement.","['info', 'spi', 'phys']"
Breaking the Limits: Redefining the Instantaneous Frequency,"The Carson and Fry (1937) introduced the concept of variable frequency as a generalization of the constant frequency. The instantaneous frequency (IF) is the time derivative of the instantaneous phase and it is well-defined only when this derivative is positive. If this derivative is negative , the IF creates problem because it does not provide any physical significance. This study proposes a mathematical solution and eliminate this problem by redefining the IF such that it is valid for all monocomponent and multicomponent signals which can be nonlinear and nonstationary in nature. This is achieved by using the property of the multivalued inverse tangent function which provides basis to ensure that instantaneous phase is an increasing function. The efforts and understanding of all the methods based on the IF would improve significantly by using this proposed definition of the IF. We also demonstrate that the decomposition of a signal, using zero-phase filtering based on the well established Fourier and filter theory , into a set of desired frequency bands with proposed IF produces accurate time-frequency-energy (TFE) distribution that reveals true nature of signal. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IF that makes zero-phase filter based decomposition most powerful, for the TFE analysis of a signal, as compared to other existing methods in the literature.","['info', 'math']"
"Metabolite Profiling in Withania somnifera Roots Hydroalcoholic Extract Using LC/MS, GC/MS and NMR Spectroscopy","Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a very well‐known herbal medicine and it was well studied for its active metabolites throughout the World. Although, nearly 40 withanolides were isolated from W. somnifera root extract, still there is remaining unidentified metabolites due to very low abundance and geographical variation. Advanced separation technology with online identification by mass and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are nowadays used to find out the new compounds in the crude herbal extract. This article described the metabolite profiling of ashwagandha root hydroalcoholic extract using ultra‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with a positive ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry through gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and NMR spectroscopy. A total of 43 possible withanolides was identified and proposed their structures based on the mass of molecular and fragment ions. GC/MS and NMR analysis indicated the presence of several known withanolides including withaferin A, withanolide D, withanoside IV or VI, withanolide sulfoxide, etc. To the best of our knowledge, dihydrowithanolide D at m/z 473 (tR 7.86 min) and ixocarpalactone A at m/z 505 (tR 8.43 min) were first time identified in the ashwagandha root hydroalcoholic extract.

Fluoride-ion-conducting Polymers: Ionic Conductivity and Fluoride Ion Diffusion Coefficient in Quaternized Polysulfones,"We describe the three-step synthesis of a new polymeric fluoride ion conductor based on the fully aromatic polymer polysulfone (PSU). In the first step, PSU is chloromethylated (CM-PSU) using reagents (i.e., stannic chloride, paraformaldehyde, and trimethylchlorosilane) that are less toxic than those used in the standard procedure. In the second step, CM-PSU reacts with a tertiary amine (trimethylamine or 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) to form quaternary ammonium groups fixed on the PSU backbone and mobile chloride counter-anions. The chloride ions can, in a third step, be exchanged with fluoride ions by immersion of the ionomer in NaF solution. The fluoride ion conductivity reaches 3-5 mScm(-1) at 25 degrees C and 5-10 mScm(-1) at 40 degrees C. We determined the F- diffusion coefficient in these ionomers by pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and by impedance spectroscopy using the Nernst-Einstein relation. The diffusion coefficients determined by the two methods are in good agreement, ranging from 2 to 4 x 10(-10) m(2) s(-1).

Influence of Solvent-Like Sidechains on the Adsorption of Light Hydrocarbons in Metal-Organic Frameworks,"A variety of strategies have been developed to adsorb and separate light hydrocarbons in metal-organic frameworks. Here, we present a new approach in which the pores of a framework are lined with four different C3 sidechains that feature various degrees of branching and saturation. These pendant groups, which essentially mimic a low-density solvent with restricted degrees of freedom, offer tunable control of dispersive host-guest interactions. The performance of a series of frameworks of the type Zn-2(fu-bdc)(2)(dabco) (fu-bdc(2-) = functionalized 1,4-benzene-dicarboxylate; dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), which feature a pillared layer structure, were investigated for the adsorption and separation of methane, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. The four frameworks exhibit low methane uptake, whereas C2 hydrocarbon uptake is substantially higher as a result of the enhanced interaction of these molecules with the ligand sidechains. Most significantly, the adsorption quantities and selectivity were found to depend strongly upon the type of sidechains attached to the framework scaffold.",['chim']

Voting Corrupt Politicians Out of Office? Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Paraguay,"This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that giving voters more power – both formally through the use of more “open” electoral systems and informally through easier access to information on politicians’ wrongdoings – will necessarily result in them voting corrupt politicians out of office. Focusing on a comparison between closed-list and open-list proportional representation systems, we theoretically show that opening the lists is likely to generate a large shift of vote shares in favor of the incumbent parties, which in many countries happen to be the most corrupt. We design a survey experiment to test these predictions in Paraguay and find strong supporting evidence. We do not find in our context that the lack of information is a major obstacle preventing voters from voting out corrupt politicians; if anything, under the more open system, supporters of the incumbent party tend to cast more votes for politicians with a recent history of corruption.",['shs']
"Les Becquerel, des polytechniciens au service de la lumière - 2ème partie : Edmond, sur les traces de son père","Reçu à l’École Polytechnique et à l’École normale supérieure, Edmond Becquerel (1820-1891) arrête ses études pour assister son père Antoine-César au Muséum. Il enseigne dans diverses institutions, notamment au Conservatoire national des arts et métiers (1852) et entre à l’Académie des sciences (1863).

"The notion of ""Nzâmbi Ampûngu Tulêndo:"" an outcome of the being-force concept","A language is a dynamic feature of a culture which usually undergoes mutation as time elapses. The Kôngo concept of the n’kisi or mpûngu (seen nowadays as essentially akin to the concept of fetish) as undergone a transformation during the time which as blurred its equivalence with the word mpungu. This differential evolution led to the later trouble the missionaries had to explain the use of the component Mpungu in connection with the divine Father, Nzâmbi Ampûngu Tulêndo. To avoid affixing the connotation of the fetish (n’kisi, mpungu) to the divine name, the missionaries tried to interpret the component “Mpûngu” in the name of the Supreme Being, as a superlative intended to modify the attribute Tulêndo (power). In this article the author shows the weakness of the superlative interpretation and demonstrates that the word n’kisi, a synonymous of mpûngu, meant originally power; it alludes to the concept of the being-force which Placid Tempels has discovered among the ethnics of Katanga, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Thus the expression “Nzâmbi Ampûngu Tulêndo” alludes to the Supreme Being as the highest concept of the Kôngo being-force.",['shs']

Testing Linear Regressions by StatsModel Library of Python for Oceanological Data Interpretation,"The study area is focused on the Mariana Trench, west Pacific Ocean. The research aim is to investigate correlation between various factors, such as bathymetric depths, geomorphic shape, geographic location on four tectonic plates of the sampling points along the trench, and their influence on the geologic sediment thickness. Technically, the advantages of applying Python programming language for oceanographic data sets were tested. The methodological approaches include GIS data collecting, data analysis, statistical modelling, plotting and visualizing. Statistical methods include several algorithms that were tested: 1) weighted least square linear regression between geological variables, 2) autocorrelation; 3) design matrix, 4) ordinary least square regression, 5) quantile regression. The spatial and statistical analysis of the correlation of these factors aimed at the understanding, which geological and geodetic factors affect the distribution of the steepness and shape of the trench. Following factors were analysed: geology (sediment thickness), geographic location of the trench on four tectonics plates: Philippines, Pacific, Mariana and Caroline and bathymetry along the profiles: maximal and mean, minimal values, as well as the statistical calculations of the 1st and 3rd quantiles. The study revealed correlations between the sediment thickness and distinct variations of the trench geomorphology and sampling locations across various segments along the crescent of the trench.","['info', 'math', 'phys']"
Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Based Isotopic Abundance Ratio Analysis of Biofield Energy Treated Methyl-2-napthylether (Nerolin),"Methyl-2-napthylether (nerolin) is an organic compound and has the applications in pharmaceutical, and perfume industry. The stable isotope ratio analysis is increasing importance in various field of scientific research. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of the biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM (2H/1H or 13C/12C or 17O/16O) and PM+2/PM (18O/16O) in nerolin using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The compound nerolin was divided into two parts - one part was control sample (untreated), and another part was considered as biofield energy treated sample which was received the biofield energy treatment through the unique biofield energy transmission process by Mr. Mahendra Kumar Trivedi (also known as The Trivedi Effect®). The biofield energy treated nerolin was analyzed at different time intervals and were represented as T1, T2, T3, and T4 in order to understand the effect of the biofield energy treatment on isotopic abundance ratio with respect to the time. From the GC-MS spectral analysis, the presence of the molecular ion peak C11H10O+ (m/z 158) along with major fragmented peaks C10H7O- (m/z 143), C10H8 (m/z 128), C9H7+ (m/z 115), C7H5+ (m/z 89), C5H3+ (m/z 63), C4H3+ (m/z 51), and C3H3+ (m/z 39) were observed in both control and biofield treated samples. Only, the relative peak intensities of the fragmented ions in the biofield treated nerolin was notably changed as compared to the control sample with respect to the time. The isotopic abundance ratio analysis of nerolin using GC-MS revealed that the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM in the biofield energy treated nerolin at T1, T2, T3, and T4 was increased by 2.38, 138.10, 13.10, and 32.14%, as compared to the control sample. Likewise, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+2/PM at T1, T2, T3, and T4 was increased by 2.38, 138.10, 13.10, and 32.14%, respectively in the biofield treated nerolin as compared to the control sample. Overall, the isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM (2H/1H or 13C/12C or 17O/16O) and PM+2/PM (18O/16O) were significantly increased in the biofield energy treated sample as compared to the control sample with respect to the time. It is concluded that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment has the significant impact on alteration in isotopic abundance of nerolin as compared to the control sample. The biofield treated nerolin might display different altered physicochemical properties and rate of reaction and could be an important intermediate for the production of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and perfumes in the industry.",['sdv']
Determination of Isotopic Abundance of 13C/12C or 2H/1H and 18O/16O in Biofield Energy Treated 1-Chloro-3-Nitrobenzene (3-CNB) Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,"1-Chloro-3-nitrobenzene (3-CNB) is an aromatic halo-amine compound used as chemical intermediate for the production of several fine chemicals like pharmaceuticals, dyes, agricultural chemicals, etc. The stable isotope ratio analysis has drawn attention in numerous fields such as agricultural, food authenticity, biochemistry, etc. The objective of the current research was to investigate the impact of the biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM, PM+2/PM and PM+3/PM in 3-CNB using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The sample, 3-CNB was divided into two parts - one part was denoted as control and another part was referred as biofield energy treated sample that was treated with biofield energy (The Trivedi Effect®). T1, T2, T3, and T4 were represented to different time interval analysis of the biofield treated 3-CNB. The GC-MS spectra of the both control and biofield treated 3-CNB indicated the presence of molecular ion peak [M+] at m/z 157 (calculated 156.99 for C6H4ClNO2) along with same pattern of fragmentation. The relative intensities of the parent molecule and other fragmented ions of the biofield treated 3-CNB were improved as compared to the control 3-CNB. The percentage change of the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM was significantly increased in the biofield treated 3-CNB at T1, T2 and T3 by 11.62, 18.50, and 29.82%, respectively with respect to the control 3-CNB. Accordingly, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+2/PM in the biofield treated 3-CNB at T2 and T3 was significantly improved by 15.22 and 35.09%, respectively as compared to the control sample. The isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM and PM+2/PM in the biofield treated 3-CNB at T1 and T4 were changed as compared to the control sample. The percentage change of the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+3/PM was enhanced in the biofield treated 3-CNB at T1, T2, T3, and T4 by 4.67, 18.69, 31.31 and 6.08%, respectively as compared to the control 3-CNB. The isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM, PM+2/PM and PM+3/PM in the biofield treated 3-CNB changed with the time. So, the biofield energy treated 3-CNB might exhibit the altered isotope effects such as altered physicochemical and thermal properties, binding energy, and the rate of the chemical reaction as compared to the control sample. The biofield energy treated 3-CNB might assist in designing for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, dyes, corrosion inhibitors and other several useful industrial chemicals.",['chim']

Charles XIV Jean (alias Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte) and the Finnish Question,"One of the first important acts of Charles Jean XIV as head of Sweden was to renounce the idea of reconquering Finland. It was a difficult position to take, considering the conditions of the time, and in all likelihood, he swung back and forth for several months before taking a definitive decision, contrary to what he might have asserted later. Moreover, the regent, then sovereign, of Sweden, was forced to justify his choice throughout his reign and to navigate between the dangerous reefs of a diverse opposition , which was organised to varying degrees.Thus, the Finnish policy was, for another thirty years, a thorn in the side of the royal power at Stockholm.L'un des premiers actes importants de Charles XIV Jean à la tête de la Suède fut de renoncer à la reconquête de la Finlande.

Geophysical Modelling of the Middle America Trench using GMT,"The study is focused on the geomorphological analysis of the Guatemala Trench, East Pacific Ocean. Research goal is to find geometric variations in western and eastern flanks of the trench and correlation of the submarine geomorphology with geologic settings and seismicity through numerical and graphical modelling. Methods include GMT based analysis of the bathymetry, geomorphic shape and surface trends in topography and gravity grids. Dataset contains raster grids on bathymetry, gravity, geoid and geological layers. Technical workflow is following: 1) Bathymetric mapping by modules ('grdcut', 'grdimage'); 2) Datasets visualizing and analysis, 3) Topographic and gravimetric surface modelling by ASCII data; 4) Cartographic mapping ('psbasemap', 'psxy', 'grdcontour') 4) 3D-mesh modelling; 5) Automatically digitized orthogonal cross-stacked profiles ('grdtrack'); 6) Visualizing curvature trends ('trend1d'); 7) statistical histograms. Results reveal unevenness in the structure of the submarine landforms. Modelling cross-section profiles highlighted depth variation at different parts of the transects and seafloor segments. Geomorphic structure has straight shape form of the slopes with steep oceanward forearc. Its geometry has steep and strait shape which correlates with seismicity. Depth samples vary:-3000 to-6200 m, seafloor is 3-5 km wide. Trench has symmetric accurate 'V-shaped' geometric form for the segment of-30 to-30 km. Oceanward side slope increases towards continental shelf, left flank stabilizes in depths at-50 km from the trench axis, deepens at-50 to 0 m, decreases at-3,200 to-5,800. Oceanward flank gradient varies: slope steepness of 35,63° at 0-20 km, 42,17° at 20-40 km, 44° at 40-60km. Left flank has 43,24° at 0-24 km, 28,33° at 24-40 km, 14° at 40-60 km, 1,13° at 60-200 km. Marine vertical gravity correlates with tectonic slab contours (20-30 mGal on the trench slopes). The study demonstrated effective GMT-based framework with a multidisciplinary scope that combined cartographic methods of modelling deep-sea trench profiles with geological, bathymetric and geophysical analysis. Technical application of the advanced cartographic solutions and high quality mapping by GMT demonstrated its functionality for data analysis and effectiveness of the geoinformation processing. Proposed techniques and workflow methodology provided framework for geological mapping and can be applied in further similar research.",['phys']
AWK and GNU Octave Programming Languages Integrated with Generic Mapping Tools for Geomorphological Analysis,"The paper presents a sequential use of the AWK and GNU Octave programming languages integrated with Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) for geospatial data analysis. The geographic scope of the research is focused on the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, north Pacific Ocean. Practical research aim is to analyse and compare bathymetry in the southern and northern part of the trench using digitized cross-section profiles. The initial mapping and geospatial analysis was performed in GMT scripting toolset. The GMT was used for cartographic mapping based on the raster ETOPO1 grid and automatic digitizing of the profiles crossing the trench perpendicularly. Besides visualized map, the processed geodata were received in a numerical form as a complex multi-field table for each segment. These tables were generated by the GMT in its native format and could not be directly processed by the MATLAB/Octave. Therefore, the tables were exported to AWK, a data-driven programming language and a powerful tool for data extraction. The table was then restructured, sorted and reshaped by the AWK script. Because the total amount of profiles overstepped 100 (62 and 52 for the northern and southern trench segments), only selected profiles were visualized. For this purpose, at the next step the modified tables were converted to GNU Octave language for visualizing and plotting selected profiles. Finally, the geomorphology was analysed and two segments compared. The results show that the southern part has deeper bathymetric values, vary in geomorphic structure and has steeper gradient slopes comparing to the north, which is caused by the seismicity, volcanism, geologic and tectonic settings. Three full scripts of GMT, AWK and GNU Octave programming languages are presented for replicability in the Appendix.","['info', 'phys']"
"Geospatial Analysis by Python and R: Geomorphology of the Philippine Trench, Pacific Ocean","The study area is focused on the Philippine Trench, a hadal trench located in the axe of the collision of the Philippine Sea Plate and Sunda Plate, west Pacific Ocean. The research is aimed at the analysis of the trench geomorphology by a correlation between changes in slope steepness and environmental variables. The methodology consists in modeling data by statistical libraries of Python and R programming languages. The results revealed that variations in the slope steepness correlate with the sediment thickness across the Philippine Trench. Variations in the landform are caused by a combination of various factors that include geology, tectonic slab dynamics, and increasing depths in bathymetry. Algorithms of the advanced machine learning and graph-based analysis applied for the marine geological data set demonstrated in this research enabled to gain insights into the seafloor geomorphology that can only be accessible by remote sensing methods and modeling. Application of the statistical methods of the data analysis by Python and R packages has broad applicability to similar research aimed at modeling landform variations in the submarine geomorphology of the hadal trenches.","['info', 'phys']"
Calculating slope gradient variations in the submarine landforms by R and Python statistical libraries,"This research focuses on the analysis of the submarine geomorphology in the Mariana Trench located in west Pacific Ocean. The research question is to identify variations in the geomorphic form and bathymetry in different segments of the trench. Technically, the paper applies Python and R programming statistical libraries for geospatial modelling of the data sets. The methodological approach of the statistical data analysis by scripting libraries aimed to visualize geomorphic variations in the 25 transect profiles of the trench. Multiple factors affect submarine geomorphology causing variations in the gradient slope: geological settings (rock composition, structure, permeability, erodibility of the materials), submarine erosion, gravity flows of water streams, tectonics, sediments from the volcanic arcs, transported by transverse submarine canyons. Understanding changes in geomorphic variations is important for the correct geospatial analysis. However, modelling such a complex structure as hadal trench requires numerical computation and advanced statistical analysis of the data set. Such methods are proposed by R and Python programming languages. Current research presented usage of statistical libraries for the data processing: Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Seaborn, StatsModels by Python. The research workflow includes following steps: Partial least squares regression analysis; Ordinary Least Square (OLS); Violin plots and Bar plots for analysis of ranges of the bathymetric data; Isotonic Regression by StatsModels library; Data distribution analysis by Bokeh and Matplotlib libraries; Circular bar plots for sorting data by R; Euler-Venn diagrams for visualizing overlapping of attributes and factors by Python. As a result of the data analysis, the geomorphology of the trench slopes in 25 transecting profiles was modelled. The results achieved by the statistical data modelling show differences in the gradient slope in various segments of the trench depending on its spatial location. This shows complex geological structure of the trench. The paper contributes towards the methodological development of the data analysis in marine geology through the stepwise workflow explanations with a case study of Python and R applications","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"
A Novel Observer Design for Sensorless Sampled Output Measurement: Application of Variable Speed Doubly Fed Induction Generator,"This paper presents a novel exponentially convergent nonlinear observer design for variable speed doubly fed induction generators (DFIG). The main feature of the proposed observer lies in the use of sampled-data without necessitating mechanical sensors, making the observer more reliable. A main component of the observer is an inter-sampled predictor of the output current vector. The observer exponential convergence is established and analyzed using Lyapunov stability technique and the small gain theorem. The proposed observer combines the advantage of a high-gain structure in terms of convergence speed and the continuity of the estimated state trajectory. One difficulty of the present observer design problem is that the electromagnetic torque is not related to the output by an injective map. The simulation results in variable speed DFIG operation are provided to confirm the theoretical results.",['spi']

Modeling and estimation of the pollutants emissions in the Compression Ignition diesel engine.,"Legislation concerning the pollutant emissions of diesel passenger cars is becoming increasingly restrictive, especially for nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). A methodology that combined physical approach and a dynamic output feedback based observer for the modelling and estimation of the pollutant emissions in diesel engines is thus proposed. A grey box control-oriented model of NOx emissions is developed; this model was designed based on a deep analysis of the crank-angle discrete combustion process of the test-bench diesel engine. This model will be used to help the understanding of the thermal NOx emission formation process. It provides the basics for the further development of the diesel engine emissions control-oriented models, but it couldn't be used to predict real-time pollutant emissions on a vehicle. The model is calibrated by experimental measurements and a complete cylinder pressure and temperature analysis. Then, to solve the vehicle integration problem (real-time calculation problem) this model and a linear model of the diesel engine were used to develop an dynamic observer to estimate the quantities of particulate matter.","['math', 'spi', 'phys', 'chim']"

A DSL-based Approach for Elasticity Testing of Cloud Systems,"Elastic cloud systems automatically respond to workload changes by (de-)allocating resources according to a cong-uration specication. Testing such systems requires eort from the tester. In particular, the tester is brought to specify the sequence of resource variations he/she is willing to test the system under, and then, drive the system through this specic sequence of variations while the test is being executed. In this paper, we propose a Domain Specic Language (DSL) aiming at reducing the tester's eort to write and execute elasticity testing. Our DSL abstracts test case specication from the cloud provider's libraries, making our language portable. The DSL compiles into executable code that implicitly orchestrates the execution of elasticity testing. In our preliminary results, we show that our approach reduces the amount of words to specify test cases w.r.t. dedicated libraries. It also shows how much this improvement scales when running a test on multiple cloud providers.",['info']
Local Structure in the Web,"The web graph has been widely adopted as the core describing the web structure [4]. However, little attention has been paid to the relationship betweenthe web graph and the location of the pages. It has already been noticed that links are often local (i.e. from a page to another page of the same server) and this can be used for efficient encoding of the web graph [9,7]. Locality in the web can be further modelled by the clustered graph induced by the prefix tree of URLs. The web tree's internal nodes are the commonprefixes of URLs and its leaves are the URLs themselves. A prefix ordering of URLs according to this tree allows to observe local structure in the web directly on the adjacency matrix M of the web graph. M splits in two terms : M = D + S, where D is diagonal by blocks and S is a very sparse matrix. The blocks of D that can be observed along the diagonal are sets of pages strongly related together.",['info']
Dimensionality reduction of the resilience model of a critical infrastructure network by means of elementary effects sensitivity analysis,"Modern Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are typically characterized by a large number of elements interconnected and interdependent. Their mathematical representation reflects these characteristics in models that typically turn out to be: 1) complex, since the relation between the variables can be nonlinear; 2) large, since a high number of variables is typically involved in the model; 3) dynamic, because the behavior of the system evolves in time. For this reason, the opportunities of exploring these models in order to extract information, such as identifying the most critical events, is conditioned by the computational cost of a simulation run and by the number of variables to explore. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of reducing the dimensionality of a model by identifying the variables that affect it most, by means of the Elementary Effects (EEs) method, which is a sensitivity analysis method capable of screening the input variables resorting to a limited number of model evaluations. Since the performance of the method relies on its settings, we analyze them proposing at the same time possible improvements. A hybrid network for gas and power distribution is considered as case study. The objective is to rank the importance of some uncertain parameters of the network (e.g., its failure and recovery characteristics) with respect to the system resilience properties (i.e., the capability of mitigating the effect of components failures and/or recovering its performance).","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
"Fictions of ""la tournante"": Fallacies, Facts, and Effects","The distinction from which this article departs — as restated by Sigmund Freud in the first of his ""Contributions to the Psychology of Love"" — sets science against literature: the former, having totally renounced the improper, because ""unreasonable"", influence of affect (""die vollkommenste Lossagung vom Lustprinzip""), deals only with the facts, leaving to the latter the production of certain (emotional, aesthetic, literary) effects. Analysis of Édith Wolf's ""En réunion"" (2003), Élisa Brune's ""La Tournante"" (2001) and Fabrice Genestal's ""La Squale"" (2000), however, reveals the convergence of ontological and discursive facts to be the product of signifying effects. By laying bare the performative processes by which fictional depictions of gang-rape in France came to be ""taken as"", as if having ""the force of"", scientific fact, this article explores (and explodes) Freud's science-literature opposition. What is more, the absolutist terms upon which Freud's assessment stands imply that the primary use of language is to convey meaning, and that words bear an originary relation to things. By demonstrating, with reference to each of the three texts under consideration, how the correspondence of words and images with real things in the world is achieved, this article trenches upon (and troubles) this commonplace misconception. For the denial and/or the dispossession of this potential — not of the representational power to describe, but of the performative power to construct, relations of correspondence with reality — is to perpetrate that which John Langshaw Austin, the British linguist and father of speech-act theory, calls the ""'descriptive' fallacy"". In the final part of this article, I problematize this particular use of language — this inwrought pattern of locutionary usage — further. For, by insisting upon those elements which are, by different definitions, ""constative"", ""literal"", and ""representational"", and by establishing such firm correlations between their fictional depictions of ""la tournante"" and the scientific discourse of facts, Wolf's ""En réunion"", Brune's ""La Tournante"" and Genestal's ""La Squale"" conceal that which is ideological and allegorical through the efficacy of their discursive effects.",['shs']
Investigation for Efficient Fractal Antenna Arrays with Novel Design Methodology and Fractal Excitations,"Fractal Antennas and Antenna arrays are frequency independent-multiband antennas. These antennas have become popular due to their recursive nature and rapid beam forming algorithms. Like conventional antenna arrays, side lobe level and beam width are the primary designing challenges in these arrays. But basic drawback of these arrays is huge number of elements (Depending on expansion factor). To overcome these challenges in fractal antenna arrays, again the solution is in the fractal geometry. In fractal geometry, any shape or structure or number can be recursively generated with fractional dimensions, this means the same shape or number repeats again and again with different dimensions. Fractal antenna technology is geometry-based, not material based, that’s why fractal antennas are also called as artistic antennas. Novel design methodologies and new fractal shapes may be helpful for further improvement of antenna parameters. This work proposes a concentric elliptical ring sub array generator design methodology for the systematic expansion of deterministic fractal antenna arrays. Using this design methodology any polygon shape can be constructed. This methodology replicates the concentric circular ring sub array generator but in this case circular generator is replaced with an elliptical generator. This methodology shows better performance in orientation of the structure, Side lobe level and 3-dB beam width rather than previous design methodologies. Reduced side lobe level in any antenna array can be achieved with non-uniform current excitations. But, due to huge number of elements in fractal arrays application of conventional current excitations like binomial current distribution to this type of arrays may be difficult in practical implementation. Conventional current distributions can be useful for side lobe level reduction and formation of narrow or broad beam widths depending on the application. But thinning of elements cannot be achieved with the conventional current distributions, while maintaining proper side lobe level and beam width values. This work proposes various fractal current distributions exclusively for thinning of fractal antenna arrays with proper balancing between side lobe level and beam width values. The two methods, namely concentric elliptical ring sub array generator and fractal distribution of current can be helpful for the efficient design of fractal antenna arrays with less cost of designing.",['spi']
Swath bathymetric data fusion Application to autonomous underwater vehicles,"The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) DAURADE platform can acquire bathymetry with two acoustic sensors: a multibeam echo sounder (MBES) and an interferometric sidescan sonar (ISSS). The two sensors (MBES and ISSS) are synchronized and they can simultaneously operate and acquire the bathymetry with different resolutions, geometries and error models. This complementarily allows us to improve the accuracy and the coverage of the collected bathymetric data by fusing both of them. We applied the fusion process on actual data from the two bathymetric sensors of DAURADE (Reson 7125 MBES and Klein 5000 Interferometric); the obtained results are presented and discussed.",['spi']

Evaluation of the New e-Health Signaling Model in the USN Environment,"Ubiquitous Sensor Network (USN) is a conceptual network built over existing physical networks. It makes use of sensed data and provides knowledge services to anyone, anywhere and at anytime, and where the information is generated by using context awareness. In 2010, the ITU-T provided the requirements to support USN applications and services in the Next Generation Network (NGN) environment to exploit the advantages of the core network. One of the main promising markets for the USN application and services is the e-Health. It provides continuous patients’ monitoring and enables a great improvement in medical services. In this paper, the authors provide the evaluation of the e-Health signaling model in the USN environment, which was introduced in a previously published work. The model is based on using the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as a service controller sub-layer for the USN platform. This paper provides a USN based IMS detailed network design for e-Health implementation with emphasizes on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) modification and middleware entities functions. The proposal evaluation was carried using OPNET Modeler for network simulation and proved its applicability and reliability.",['info']
Latency-Aware Strategies for Placing Data Stream Analytics onto Edge Computing,"Much of the ""big data"" generated today is received in near real-time and requires quick analysis. In Internet of Things (IoT) [1, 9], for instance, continuous data streams produced by multiple sources must be handled under very short delays. As a result, several stream processing engines have been proposed. Under several engines, a stream processing application is a directed graph or dataflow whose vertices are operators that execute a function over the incoming data and edges that define how data flows between them. A dataflow has one or multiple sources (i.e., sensors, gateways or actuators), operators that perform transformations on the data (e.g., filtering, mapping, and aggregation) and sinks (i.e., queries that consume or store the data). In a traditional cloud deployment, the whole application is placed in the cloud computing to benefit from virtually unlimited resources. However, processing all the data in the cloud can introduce latency due to data transfer, which makes near real-time processing difficult to achieve. In contrast, edge computing has become an attractive solution for performing certain stream processing operators, as many edge devices have non-trivial compute capacity. The deployment of data stream processing applications onto heterogeneous infrastructure has been proved to be NP-hard [2]. Moving operators from cloud to edge devices is challenging due to limitations of edge devices [5]. Existing work often proposes placements strategies considering user intervention [8]. Many models do not support memory and communication constraints [6, 4] while others consider all data sinks to be located in the cloud, with no feedback loop to actua-tors located at the edge of the network [3, 7]. There is a lack of solutions covering scenarios involving smart cities, precision agriculture, and smart homes comprising various heterogeneous sensors and actuators, as well as, time-constraint applications. We model the data stream processing placement problem considering heterogeneous computational and network resources, and computing and communication as M/M/1 queues (i.e., Poisson arrival distribution, exponential service time and single server). Events are handled in a First-Come, First-Served fashion both by the computation and communication services, guaranteeing the time order of events; an important requirement in many data stream processing applications. The model allows us to calculate the waiting and service times for each message in computation and communication queues allowing for estimating the response time. We then propose two strategies to minimize the application response time by splitting the dataflow graph dynamically and distributing the operators across cloud and edge infrastructure. We focus on real-time analytics applications with multiple sources and sinks distributed across resources. In particular, we first decompose the application graph by considering behaviors such as forks and joins (i.e., split points), and by identifying the operator dependencies recursively. The Response Time Rate (RTR) strategy takes the decomposed graph and organizes the deployment sequence and consecutively calculates the response time for each operator by considering the previous mappings, resource capabilities, and operator requirements. RTR with Region Patterns (RTR+RP) strategy extends RTR by exploiting the split points to first find candidate operators for edge or cloud and then estimates the response time for the edge operators. Comprehensive simulations considering multiple application configurations demonstrate that our approach can improve the response time up to 50%. For future work, we will investigate further techniques to deal with CPU-intensive operators and their energy consumption.",['info']
The SIPSim implicit parallelism model and the SkelGIS library,"Scientific simulations give rise to complex codes where data size and computation time become very important issues, and sometimes a scientific barrier. Thus, parallelization of scientific simulations becomes a significant work. Many time and human efforts are deployed to produce efficient parallel programs. But still, many simulations could not be parallelized because of lack of time to learn parallel programming or lack of human resources. Therefore, aiding parallelization through abstracted parallelism or implicit parallelism has become a main topic in computer science. Many implicit parallelism solutions have been proposed such as algorithmic skeletons libraries, domain-specific languages or specific libraries. In this paper is introduced a new type of solution to give a totally transparent access to parallel programming for non-computer scientists of the domain of numerical simulations. This solution is an implicit parallelism model, called Structured Implicit Parallelism on scientific Simulations (SIPSim). After a description of the SIPSim model, this paper presents the implementation of the model, as a C++ templated library called SkelGIS, for two different cases of simulations: simulations on Cartesian meshes and simulations of two physical phenomena linked through a network. For each case, the implementation of the SIPSim components are described, and a simple simulation example is given. SkelGIS is then evaluated on two real cases, one for each case, first on the resolution of shallow water equations and second on an arterial blood flow simulation. To clearly state on SkelGIS performance and its ease of programming, different experiments on both cases are evaluated.",['info']

Photoluminescence from InGaAs/GaAs quantum well regrown on a buried patterned oxidized AlAs layer,"We present a quasi-planar technological approach for forming a flexible and versatile confinement scheme based on oxidation of AlGaAs buried layers combined to an epitaxial regrowth. This method improves the electrical and optical confinements compared to the lateral oxidation since it allows to define confinement areas from a planar surface. This technique is suitable for the realization of advanced integrated photonic components arrays with close device-to-device spacing such as two-dimensional arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. Our results prove that the oxidation and epitaxial regrowth can be sequenced in a process flow, leading to viable confinement while preserving good radiative properties.",['spi']
Investigation of Methane-Air Laminar Flame to Apply in Internal Combustion Engines,"Even though combustion has been studied for a long time, however, due to complex essence of combustion which is a combination of different physical and chemical phenomena, there are still a lot of questions which should be addressed to improve efficiency of combustion systems such as internal combustion engines. Methane is one of the fuel which can be replaced to the normal fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel. In this study laminar flame of a methane and air is studied in a freely propagating combustion tube. Different phenomena regarding to laminar flame such as laminar flame speed is studied. Subsequently, preheating zone, reaction zone and secondary reaction zone are studied and their thickness are reported. Finally, to understand the effect of operating conditions, parametric study of equivalence ratio and initial pressure are performed. Results showed that the laminar flame speed is maximum around the stoichiometric air and methane mixture. Also, with increasing the initial pressure, the laminar flame speed reduced monotonically.","['info', 'spi', 'phys', 'chim']"

G–BAM: A Generalized Bandwidth Allocation Model for IP/MPLS/DS-TE Networks,"Bandwidth Allocation Models (BAMs) configure and handle resource allocation (bandwidth, LSPs, fiber) in networks in general (IP/MPLS/DS-TE, optical domain, other). BAMs currently available for IP/MPLS/DS-TE networks (MAM, RDM, G-RDM and AllocTC-Sharing) basically define resource restrictions (bandwidth) by "" class "" (traffic class, application´s class, user´s class or other grouping criteria) and allocate on demand this resource. There is a BAM allocation policy inherent for each existing model which behaves differently under distinct network state, such as heavy traffic loads and dynamic traffic and/or application scenarios. A generalized Bandwidth Allocation Model (G-BAM) is proposed in this paper. G-BAM, firstly, incorporates the inherent behavior of currently used BAMs such as MAM, RDM, G-RDM and AllocTC-Sharing in IP/MPLS/DS-TE context. G-BAM, secondly, proposes a new policy/ behavior allocation in addition to existing ones in which additional private resources are incorporated. G-BAM, thirdly, allows a smoother BAM policy transition among existing policy alternatives resulting from MAM, RDM and AllocTC-Sharing adoption independently. The paper focuses on the first characteristics of G-BAM which is to reproduce MAM, RDM and AllocTC-Sharing behaviors. As such, the required configuration to achieve MAM, RDM and AllocTC-Sharing behaviors is presented followed by a proof of concept. Authors argue that the G-BAM reproducibility characteristics may improve overall network resource utilization under distinct traffic profiles.",['info']

Generic Mapping Tools and Matplotlib Package of Python for Geospatial Data Analysis in Marine Geology,"Understanding patterns of the correlation between the geomorphology and geology of the seafloor of the hadal trenches is important for the proper ocean modelling. Current paper focuses on the west Pacific Ocean region with a special case of Mariana Trench, the deepest hadal trench on the planet. Methodology of the research include combination of Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) and Quantum GIS based mapping of the geographic location, bathymetry, geodesy, sediment thickness, geomorphic shape, tectonic and geologic structure of the Mariana Trench area, and statistical analysis by means of Python. A GMT was selected for GIS visualization due to its powerful functionality and effective cartographic solutions. An object-oriented high-level programming language, Python was chosen for the data analysis and scientific plotting. The statistical analysis includes following steps: 1) Data distribution by the box plots; 2) Data sorting and grouping by stem plots; 3) Correlation analysis by 3D comparative plots referred to four tectonic plates; 4) Principal Component Analysis; 5) Analysis of Variance. The statistical analysis of the data set was performed in Matplotlib library and its dependencies: NumPy, SciPy and Pandas. A combination of the powerful methods by GMT with data analysis supported by Python programming language is an important method in geosciences aimed to increase the effectiveness of the data analysis by cartographic mapping, statistical computations and graph plotting. This paper illustrated usage of GMT, QGIS and Python for combined data analysis scheme.

"Glacial Landscapes and Protohistoric Cultural Heritage of the Mount Bego Region, Southern French Alps","The region of Mount Bego, which is located in the Southern French Alps, is an interesting place to observe scenic inherited landforms as well as cultural remains left by the ancient human societies who lived there. Geomorphology, Archaeology and Anthropology are working jointly to reconstruct the history of landscapes and societies. In particular, the Bronze Age people used the perfect stony tables created by glacial erosion. Indeed, they engraved approximately 40,000 petroglyphs on rocks polished by the ice during the Last Glacial Maximum. At that time, the climate was very cold, corresponding to the full expansion of glaciers. Only the peaks of Mount Grand Capelet and Mount Bego were protruding from the ice. The glacial imprint is widespread in the landscapes of the Mount Bego region, which displays about 40 cirques, abundant moraines and erratic boulders and 30 glacial lakes. Periglacial conditions, which developed after glacier melting, favoured the formation of rock glaciers before the Postglacial warming which induced peat formation. The first traces of the landscape transformation by the human societies date back to the Neolithic, three millennia before the Protohistoric societies left the outstanding petroglyphs of the so- called Vallée des Merveilles (Valley of Wonders).","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"

The Hough transform is a famous method for detecting lines in binary images but in this study, FLS sonar data are in grayscale and plotted in three dimensions.

Why Synchronization is a Key Issue in Modern Electronic Support Measures,"The goal of this paper is to show that in order to achieve good localization performances with a modern Electronic Support Measure (ESM) system based on Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) and Frequency Difference Of Arrival (FDOA) measurements, it is necessary to have a precisely synchronized time base on every sensor. An application case is detailed to show how an imperfect synchronization causes degradations in the localization performances at the output of the system. It focuses on a simple scenario: two airborne receivers using TDOA and FDOA measurements to localize a stationary emitter. In the first section the synchronization process and its error model are defined. The second section presents simulations which show the influence of these errors on the estimation of TDOA and FDOA measurements. In the last section are discussed the final localization performances, based on the calculation of the Cramér- Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) using the previous corrupted estimates of TDOA and FDOA.",['spi']

Assessing Product Line Derivation Operators Applied to Java Source Code: An Empirical Study,"Product Derivation is a key activity in Software Product Line Engineering. During this process, derivation operators modify or create core assets (e.g., model elements, source code instructions, components) by adding, removing or substituting them according to a given configuration. The result is a derived product that generally needs to conform to a programming or modeling language. Some operators lead to invalid products when applied to certain assets, some others do not; knowing this in advance can help to better use them, however this is challenging, specially if we consider assets expressed in extensive and complex languages such as Java. In this paper, we empirically answer the following question: which product line operators, applied to which program elements , can synthesize variants of programs that are incorrect , correct or perhaps even conforming to test suites? We implement source code transformations, based on the derivation operators of the Common Variability Language. We automatically synthesize more than 370,000 program variants from a set of 8 real large Java projects (up to 85,000 lines of code), obtaining an extensive panorama of the sanity of the operations.",['info']

Multifractal comparison of the extremes of rain rates and integrated vapour content,"Rainfall extremes are studied through the analyse of three related fields measured with the help of co-located devices installed in the roof of the Ecole des Ponts ParisTech building: (i) Integrated Water Vapour (IWV); it corresponds the amount of water vapour present in the vertical columns between a GPS ground receiver and corresponding satellites. It is estimated from the time shift between the expected duration the signal needs to reach the receiver (the two positions are known) and the actual one (ii) Rain rate measured by three optical disdrometers of two different types (Campbell Scientific PWS100 and OTT Parsivel2 (iii) Relative humidity measured by a dedicated sensor First the correlations between these quantities during significant events is analysed. It appears that although IWV tends to decrease (vapour condense to form drops that fall) and relative humidity to increase during a rainfall event, it turns out difficult to quantitatively characterize this link. It is possibly due to the fact that the scale gap between a punctual measure for the rain rate and an average over a few km height column for the IWV is too large. Finally the scaling features of these three fields are investigated with the help of the Universal Multifractal framework which has been extensively used to analyse and simulate geophysical fields extremely variable over wide ranges of scales. Only three parameters are used to characterize variability across scales: C1 the mean intermittency, alpha the multifractality index and H the non-conservative exponent. Retrieved features are compared and the notion of maximum observable singularity is used to quantify the extremes of the various fields.

Experimental demonstration of time warping to invert for array tilt and mode shape on a vertical array in a shallow arctic environment,"Vertical arrays provide the most convenient geometry for many underwater passive acoustic applications that require the identification and isolating of propagating normal modes. Unfortunately, practical deployments of vertical arrays face several practical issues, including the need to compensate for vertical array inclination, and incomplete coverage of the water column that makes the use of Sturm-Liouville orthogonality problematic. Here bowhead whale signals collected in the Arctic Ocean are used to demonstrate how the use of non-linear sampling (called “warping”) in the time domain can be used to directly invert for array tilt, as well as yield mode shapes, without resort to the orthogonality relations.",['spi']
AUTOMATIC SPATIAL CLUSTERING AND TRACKING OF SEA SURFACE OBSTACLES IN FORWARD LOOKING SONAR IMAGES,"This paper presents an automatic sea surface object clustering and tracking in forward looking sonar images. The considered sea surface obstacles are man-made objects: buoys, boats, ships (motorboats or sailboats). Their acoustic signature varies according to their type and state (fixed or moving). The proposed method detects the various target signatures. Then detections are gathered into clusters using an automatic and adaptive clustering method based on the Delaunay Triangulation. After the clustering stage, isolated detections are rejected and the remaining clusters are classified into two types: clusters including wake or not. This classification is based on the shape eccentricity feature. Then, according to the cluster type, the obstacle position is extracted to be used for tracking. For clusters without wake, the obstacle position is the centroid of the cluster but for clusters including wake, wake extremities are set as possible vessel position. Finally, obstacle tracking is carried out in Cartesian coordinates using the Debiased Converted Measurement Kalman filter and the Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter. Promising results are obtained using real data collected at sea with various objects and scenarios.",['spi']

Communication-aware Parallelization Strategies for High Performance Applications.,"With the advent of multicore processor architectures and the existence of a huge legacy code base, the need for efficient and scalable parallelizing compilers is growing. Where multi-core processors were seen as the way forward to address the known challenges such as the memory, power and ILP wall, efficient parallelization to make use of the multiple cores, is still an open issue. In this paper, we present two complementary tools, MCROF and XPU which provide an alternative development path to parallelize applications and that address the challenges of identifying potential parallelism and exploiting it in a different way. The MCROF tool provides a detailed profile of the data flowing inside an application and the XPU programming paradigm provides an intuitive and simple interface to express parallelism as well as the necessary runtime support. We demonstrate through two different use cases that better performance up to 4× can be achieved than available commercial compilers.",['info']
A Role Language to Interpret Multi-Formalism System of Systems Models,"New systems are by nature distributed and built around existing systems. The concept of System of systems (SoS) has become the key for creating new systems. Modeling is a central issue of SoS design and evolution. Since subsystems of a SoS can be modeled in different languages, the SoS modeling environment should be able to handle heterogeneous modeling formalism. Traditionally, this problem is handled through typebased model transformations which are rigid and static.

An usage of the role modeling language on a seafloor observatory use case is shown.",['info']
"A Formal, Model-driven Design Flow for System Simulation and Multi-core Implementation","With the growing complexity of Real-Time Embedded Systems (RTES), there is a huge interest in using modeling languages such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), and other Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques targeting RTES system design. These approaches provide language abstractions for system design, allowing to focus on their relevant properties. Unfortunately, such approaches still suffer from several shortcomings including the lack of well-defined semantics. Therefore, it remains difficult to connect the MDE specification tools and the design tools that are based on formal grounds and well-defined semantics to perform analysis, validation or system synthesis for RTES. This paper presents a top-down RTES design flow aiming to reduce the gap between MDE and formal design approaches. We present the connection between a framework dedicated to the enrichment of modeling languages such as UML with formal semantics, a framework based on formal models of computation supporting validation by simulation, and a system synthesis tool targeting a flexible platform with well-defined execution services. Our purpose is to cover several system design phases from specification, simulation down to implementation on a platform. As a case study, a JPEG Encoder application was realized following the different design steps of the tool-chain.",['info']
Subspace method with multi scale wavelet for identification of handwritten lines,"This article proposes a new indicator for handwriting examination in text independent framework. Experiments of writer identification are addressed using only handwritten short lines instead of a whole character. After preprocessing such as binarization and contours extraction, profiles of contours of handwritten lines were decomposed with fifth scales wavelet decomposition. As the result, we obtained indicators which showed qualities of handwritten lines such as smooth or jaggy. The indicators were analysed with Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and eigen vectors were obtained. In a phase of writer identification, using Kernel Orthogonal Mutual Subspace Method (KOMSM), subspace was calculated by the eigen vectors. The result obtained through the experiments was not enough to satisfy. In future works, the proposed method will be applied to whole handwritten characters.",['info']
An approach for describing concurrency and communication of heterogeneous systems,"The fast development of technology and the time-to-market constraints need well-adapted technical support and development processes to ease design space exploration and the reduction of the productivity gap. Model Based Engineering (MBE) overcomes the increasing complexity of system being highly heterogeneous and integrating concurrent sub-systems. Elsewhere, Models of Computation (MoC) help enforcing MBE with aspects related to the execution semantics of models. In a previous paper, we introduced a language called Cometa providing more expressiveness for these aspects. It allows the capture and analysis of several MoCs at high level of abstraction, highlighting communication and synchronization among parts of a heterogeneous system. The language was tooled in Rhapsody and tested on an industrial case. In this paper, we present the key concepts of the Cometa language and the tooling experiments of Cometa in an open source environment. The objective of this approach is being able to model heterogeneous systems, but also to broaden the scope of the language tooling, by taking benefits from an open source environment.",['info']
A Statistical-Topological Feature Combination for Recognition of Isolated Hand Gestures from Kinect Based Depth Images,"Reliable hand gesture recognition is an important problem for automatic sign language recognition for the people with hearing and speech disabilities. In this paper, we create a new benchmark database of multi-oriented, isolated ASL numeric images using recently launched Kinect V2. Further, we design an effective statistical-topological feature combinations for recognition of the hand gestures using the available V1 sensor dataset and also over the new V2 dataset. For V1, our best accuracy is 98.4% which is comparable with the best one reported so far and for V2 we achieve an accuracy of 92.2% which is first of its kind.",['scco']
Automated cell individualization and counting in cerebral microscopic images,"In biomedical research, cell counting is important to assess physiological and pathophysiological information. However, the automated analysis of microscopic images of tissues remains extremely challenging. We propose an automated processing protocol for proper segmentation of individual cells in microscopic images. A Gaussian filter is applied to improve signal to noise ratio (SNR) then an original minmax method is proposed to produce an image in which information describing both cell centers (minima) and boundaries are enhanced. Finally, a contour-based model initialized from minima in the min-max cartography is carried out to achieve cell individualization. This method is evaluated on a NeuN-stained macaque brain section in sub-regions presenting various levels of fraction of neuron surface occupation. Comparison with several methods of reference demonstrates that the performances of our method are superior. A first application to the segmentation of neurons in the hippocampus illustrates the ability of our approach to deal with massive and complex data.","['info', 'sdv']"
Biological realms in computer science,"In biology, evolution is usually seen as a tinkering process, different from what an engineer does when he plans the development of his systems. Recently, studies have shown that even in biology, there is a part of good engineering. As computer scientists, we have much more difficulty to admit that there is also a great deal of tinkering in what we do, and that our software systems behave more and more like biological realms every day. This essay relates my personal experience about this discovery.","['info', 'sdv']"
A PROFILE-BASED ARCHITECTURE FOR A FLEXIBLE AND PERSONALIZED INFORMATION ACCESS,"Information relevance is an important issue in information access techniques. A solution for improving this relevance is the personalization or adaptation of the answers provided to users. For this purpose we propose, in this article, an information retrieval and recommendation architecture in which any element is described in detail by a profile. The originality of this architecture is at the level of its generic aspects and the numerous possibilities of interactions between complementary profiles derived from a profile generic model. Thereafter, we propose a flexible use of profiles to evaluate the personal relevance of a user or a users group by combining various matchings between profiles criteria.","['info', 'shs']"
Profile reusability for personalized information access : application to users contexts determination.,"The notion of context is important when we are dealing with personalization. Users often change their needs in time and the determination of contexts can help to identify those changes. In this article, we associate to each information or user a profile which describes it. We show that the descriptionof a profile can be done by re-using existing profiles and we propose a method to determine various types of users contexts based on structure, contents and re-usability of profiles. We discuss the interest of the suggested method through qualitative experiments carried out the collection ""Los Angeles Times 94"" of the CLEF evaluation campaign.","['info', 'shs']"
Profiles Semantics and Matchings Flexibility for Resources Access,"Heterogeneity of resources (information, users, hardware devices, etc.) has raised the problem of defining a generic model, which would be used as a basis for describing them in various applications for resources access. In this article, we propose a profile generic model, which describes the logical structure, the contents and the semantics of any resource. Through the exploitation of profiles semantics we show the matchings flexibility that allows interoperability between different profiles and hence between different applications. For that, we define rules for deducing couples of profiles elements that have a compatible semantics and hence that we can match.","['info', 'shs']"

Advances and applications of DSmT for information fusion - Collected works - Volume 3,"This volume has about 760 pages, split into 25 chapters, from 41 contributors. First part of this book presents advances of Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) which is becoming one of the most comprehensive and flexible fusion theory based on belief functions. It can work in all fusion spaces: power set, hyper-power set, and super-power set, and has various fusion and conditioning rules that can be applied depending on each application. Some new generalized rules are introduced in this volume with codes for implementing some of them. For the qualitative fusion, the DSm Field and Linear Algebra of Refined Label (FLARL) is proposed which can convert any numerical fusion rule to a qualitative fusion rule. When one needs to work on a refined frame of discernment, the refinement can be done using Smarandache's algebraic codification. New interpretations and implementations of the fusion rules based on sampling techniques and referee functions are proposed, including the probabilistic proportional conflict redistribution rule. A new probabilistic transformation of mass of belief is also presented which outperforms the classical pignistic transformation in term of probabilistic information content. The second part of the book presents applications of DSmT in target tracking, in satellite image fusion, in snow-avalanche risk assessment, in multi-biometric match score fusion, in assessment of an attribute information retrieved based on the sensor data or human originated information, in sensor management, in automatic goal allocation for a planetary rover, in computer-aided medical diagnosis, in multiple camera fusion for tracking objects on ground plane, in object identification, in fusion of Electronic Support Measures allegiance reports, in map regenerating forest stands, etc.",['info']

Multi-scale analysis of the impact of polylactide morphology on gas barrier properties,"Semicrystalline polylactide (PLA) films with controlled morphology were produced by thermal crystallization to optimize the oxygen barrier properties. The crystalline morphology of PLA at the scales of the lamella and the spherulite was investigated and the mobile amorphous phase dynamics were studied. The crystalline morphology had a negligible impact on the oxygen diffusion coefficient. The occurrence of a rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) in the amorphous phase due to its insufficient decoupling from the crystalline phase provided an accelerated pathway for diffusion, though. As a conclusion, for reaching optimal barrier properties, semicrystalline PLA should be pre-nucleated and rapidly crystallized from the glass in the α-polymorph in the aim to reach a high crystallinity degree and decoupling of the amorphous and the crystalline phase. These recommendations can benefit to industry for the optimization of PLA annealing treatments.",['spi']
Spatial analysis of extreme rainfalls in the Cévennes-Vivarais region,"This study takes place in the MedUP project, founded by the ''Agence Nationale de la Recherche'' (French Research Agency) through its VMC program (''Vulnérabilité, Milieux, Climats ''). MedUP deals with the quantification and identification of sources of uncertainties associated with the forecast and climate projection for Mediterranean high-impact weather events. Here, we focus on the estimation of return periods and return levels of extreme rainfalls in the Cevennes-Vivarais region. The hourly data were collected from 142 raingauges located in this region between 1993 and 2000. A first analysis revealed that, the excess rainfall distribution depends on the raingauges location. We propose to model the excess rainfall distribution by a Generalized Pareto Distribution with positive shape parameter depending on geographical covariates. This so-called ''conditional tail-index'' is then estimated with a nearest neighbour approach. This permits to derive return period maps on the region of interest.",['math']
Regularization methods for Sliced Inverse Regression,"Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR) is an effective method for dimension reduction in high-dimensional regression problems. The original method, however, requires the inversion of the predictors covariance matrix. In case of collinearity between these predictors or small sample sizes compared to the dimension, the inversion is not possible and a regularization technique has to be used. Our approach is based on a Fisher Lecture given by R.D. Cook where it is shown that SIR axes can be interpreted as solutions of an inverse regression problem. We propose to introduce a Gaussian prior distribution on the unknown parameters of the inverse regression problem in order to regularize their estimation. We show that some existing SIR regularizations can enter our framework, which permits a global understanding of these methods. Three new priors are proposed leading to new regularizations of the SIR method. A comparison on simulated data as well as an application to the estimation of Mars surface physical properties from hyperspectral images are provided.",['math']

Maximizing the Number of Served Requests in an Online Shared Transport System by Solving a Dynamic DARP,"The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) consists in serving a set of users who specify their departure or arrival locations using a single vehicle. The aim of DARP is to design vehicle routes satisfying requests of users and minimizing the total traveled distance. In this work, we consider a real case of dynamic DARP service operated by Padam (www.padam.io) in Paris and Bristol. Padam offers a high quality transportation service in which users ask for a service either in real time or in advance, and get an immediate answer about whether their requests are accepted or not. The transport activity is outsourced in Padam’s service, and contracts are negotiated with third parties firms. Then each day, a fixed set of drivers is available during a working period of time to provide a transportation service of Padam. The main goal then becomes to maximize the number of accepted requests during the service. In this work, we develop a two-phase procedure to achieve it. In the first phase an insertion heuristic is used to quickly find out whether a request of a customer can be inserted, then, in the second phase, we run an ALNS algorithm between the occurrence of requests to improve the quality of the solution. The procedure was extensively tested on real data provided by Padam with up to 2000 requests and very tight side constraints and time-windows.",['info']
Reinsertion Algorithm Based on Destroy and Repair Operators for Dynamic Dial a Ride Problems,"The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) consists in serving a set of customers who specify their pickup and drop-off locations using a fleet of vehicles. The aim of DARP is designing vehicle routes satisfying requests of customers and minimizing the total traveled distance. In this paper, we consider a real case of dynamic DARP service operated by Padam3 in which customers ask for a transportation service either in advance or in real time and get an immediate answer about whether their requests are accepted or rejected. A fleet of fixed number of vehicles is available during a working period of time to provide a transportation service. The goal is to maximize the number of accepted requests during the service. In this paper, we propose an original and novel online Reinsertion Algorithm based on destroy/repair operators to reinsert requests rejected by the online algorithm used by Padam. The proposed algorithm was implemented in the optimization engine of Padam and extensively tested on real hard instances up to 1011 requests and 14 vehicles. The results show that our method succeeds in improving the number of accepted requests.",['info']
Metaheuristics for the Generalised Periodic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem,"This paper presents the Generalized Periodic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem, named GPEVRP, which is an extension of the Periodic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (PEVRP) proposed in previous research. The GPEVRP is defined by a planning horizon of several periods typically “days”, with the constraints that each customer must be visited a required number of times, which must be related to a pattern, that is, a combination of days chosen among a set of allowed combinations of days, must be satisfied every time by its required demand, and that a limited fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) available each day at the depot must be respected. The EVs could be charged during their trips at the depot and in the available external charging stations. The objective of the GPEVRP is to minimize the total cost of routing and charging over the time horizon. We propose three metaheuristics to solve the problem. The first two methods are global approaches, allow solving simultaneously the planning level (pattern assignment) and the operational level (routing and charging). These methods are Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS) and Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) for which we have proposed a new metric for the selection of patterns. The third method is a two-phase approach, called Multi-start Guided LNS, for which a perturbation phase changes the pattern and manages the planning level, and an intensification phase based on LNS optimizes the operational level and guides the perturbation through a memory. The results show that a simple global approach such as LNS leads to better results on a very constraining problem such as the problem of our study.",['info']
Metaheuristics for Periodic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem,"This paper proposes two metaheuristics based on large neighbourhood search for the PEVRP (Periodic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem). In the PEVRP a set of customers have to be visited, one times, on a given planning horizon. A list of possible visiting dates is associated with each customer and a fixed fleet of vehicles is available every day of the planning horizon. Solving the problem requires assigning a visiting date to each customer and defining the routes of the vehicles in each day of the planning horizon, such that the EVs could be charged during their trips at the depot and in the available external charging stations. The objective of the PEVRP is to minimize the total cost of routing and charging over the time horizon. The first proposed metaheuristic is a Large Neighbourhood Search, whose choice of destroy/repair operators has been determined according to the experimental results obtained in previous research. The second method is an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search, which could be described as a Large Neighborhood Search algorithm with an adaptive layer, where a set of three destroy operators and three repair operators compete to modify the current solution in each iteration of the algorithm. The results show that LNS is very competitive compared to ALNS for which the adaptive aspect has not made it more competitive than the LNS.",['info']
Boundary null-controllability of two coupled parabolic equations : simultaneous condensation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.Contrôlabilité frontière de deux équations paraboliques couplées : condensation simultanée des valeurs propres et des fonctions propres.,"Let the matrix operator $L = D\partial_{xx} + q(x)A_0$, with $D = diag(1, \nu)$, $\nu \neq 1$, $q \in L^{\infty} (0, π)$, and $A_0$ is a Jordan block of order 1. We analyze the boundary null controllability for system $y_t − Ly = 0$. When $ \nu \notin \mathbb{Q} ^*_+ $ and $q(x) = 1$, $x ∈ (0, π)$, there exists a family of root vectors of $(L * , D(L *)) $ forming a Riesz basis, moreover, F. Ammar Khodja, A.Benabdallah, M.Gonzalez-Burgos, L.Teresa, show the existence of a minimal time of control depending on condensation of eigenvalues of $(L^* , D(L^*))$. But there exists $q \in L^{\infty} (0, π)$ such that the family of eigenfunctions of $(L^* , D(L^*))$ is complete but it is not a Riesz basis. In this framework new phenomena arise : simultaneous condensation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We prove the existence of a minimal time $T_0 \in [0, +\infty]$ depending on the condensation of eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of $(L^* , D(L^*))$, such that the corresponding system is null controllable at any time $T > T_0$ and is not if $T < T_0$.Considérons l’opérateur matriciel $L = D\partial_{xx} + q(x)A_0$, avec $D = diag(1, \nu)$, $\nu \neq 1$, $q \in L^{\infty} (0, π)$, et $A_0$ est un bloc Jordan de l’ordre 1. Nous analysons la contrôlabilité à zéro pour le système $y_t − Ly = 0$. Lorsque $ \nu \notin \mathbb{Q} ^*_+ $ and $q(x) = 1$, $x ∈ (0, π)$ , il existe une famille de vecteurs propres généralisés de $(L^* , D(L^*))$ formant une base Riesz, en outre, F.

Dans ce cadre, un nouveau phénomène apparait : la condensation simultanée des valeurs propres et des fonctions propres. Nous prouvons l’existence d’un temps minimal $T_0 \in [0, +\infty]$ dépendant simultanément de la condensation des valeurs propres et des fonctions propres associées de l'opérateur $(L^* , D(L^*))$, de sorte que le système correspondant soit contrôlable au temps $T > T_0$ et non contrôlable si $T<T_0$.",['math']
Atlas of Organics: Four maps of the world of organic agriculture,"This paper presents four maps of the world of organic agriculture. Density equalising maps (cartograms) have previously been published of the world of organic agriculture based on the reported hectares of certified organically managed agriculture land. The four maps in the present atlas of organic agriculture are visual presentations of current global organics data: (a) certified organic agriculture hectares; (b) certified organic wildculture hectares; (c) total certified organic production hectares (organic agriculture plus wildculture plus forestry plus aquaculture); (d) certified organic producers. Australia dominates in the world map of the organic agriculture hectares, Europe is strongly represented, and Africa is weakly represented. Finland dominates in the world organics map of organic wildculture, Zambia is a strong representative from Africa, and India is a strong representative from Asia. Australia dominates in the map of the organics world map of total organic production hectares (the aggregation of agriculture, wildculture, forestry, and aquaculture), followed by Finland. India dominates in the world organics map of organics producers. The maps illustrate the broad global diffusion of the organics meme, visually highlight leaders and laggers, and indicate opportunities for growth and better reportage. These maps are generated by the Worldmapper GIS algorithm developed at the University of Sheffield as a cartographic visualisation tool.","['sdv', 'math', 'sde', 'shs']"
Ernesto Genoni: Australia’s pioneer of biodynamic agriculture,"Ernesto Genoni (1885-1975) pioneered biodynamic agriculture in Australia. In 1928 he was the first of (ultimately) twelve Australians to join Rudolf Steiner’s Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners (ECAFG) which was based at the Goetheanum, Dornach, Switzerland. Ernesto trained as an artist for five years at Milan’s prestigious Brera Academy. He visited his brothers in Australia, broad-acre immigrant farmers in Western Australia, in 1912 and 1914 and during these visits he worked on their, and other’s, farms. In 1916 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and served as a stretcher bearer on the battlefields of the Somme, France, before being conscripted into the Italian Army and serving jail-time in Italy as a draft resister and conscientious objector. Ernesto joined the Anthroposophical Society in Milan in 1919. He first met Rudolf Steiner in 1920 at the Goetheanum, the Anthroposophy headquarters in Switzerland. Ernesto left the Goetheanum in 1924 when Steiner retired from public life. He migrated to Australia in 1926 with aspirations for establishing a career as an artist in Australia. Instead, having arrived in Australia, he was again drawn into farm management and agricultural work. Ernesto was a champion for biodynamic agriculture, Anthroposophy, and the Austrian New Age philosopher, Rudolf Steiner - causes to which he devoted the rest of his life. In 1928 he initiated the first Anthroposophy meetings in Melbourne. In 1930 Ernesto made a grand tour of biodynamic enterprises in Europe and met the leading biodynamics advocates and practitioners of the day in Germany, Switzerland and England, including Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, Erika Riese, Ernst Stegemann, and Carl Mirbt. In 1935 Ernesto and his partner, Ileen Macpherson, who was also an anthroposophist and a member of the ECAFG, began their biodynamic farm called Demeter Biological Farm in Dandenong, Victoria. Ernesto was a founder of the Anthroposophical Society Victoria Michael Group in 1932, and he became its leader in 1962.","['sde', 'shs']"

They were both members of Rudolf Steiner's Experimental Circle and they implemented his principles of biodynamics on their farm. ""Ileen Macpherson accepted the impulse to assist in a venture for applying Bio-Dynamic methods and resolved with Ernesto Genoni to attempt a practical activity. A small farm was purchased on Princes Highway near Dandenong, approximately 18 miles from Melbourne, and a serious effort which lasted 18 years was attempted. It was worked as a small dairy farm, and the manure built into the compost in the Bio-Dynamic way. They made their own preparations and sprays and produced very good vegetables which were sold in the wholesale market in the city and also from a truck on the side of the road. Constant hard work and many grievous trials were endured by the pioneers who undertook the first Bio-Dynamic venture in Victoria”","['sde', 'shs']"
Organics Olympiad 2016: Global Indices of Leadership in Organic Agriculture,"Organic production (including agriculture, wild culture, forestry and aquaculture) is a worldwide phenomenon that is practiced in at least 172 countries. The Organics Olympiad presents 14 indices of global organics leadership, each at three levels (Gold, Silver and Bronze). The Organics Olympiad of 2016 yields 29 countries as global organics leaders, and confirms that organics leadership is diversely distributed across countries, large and small, rich and poor, developed and less so, and cuts across linguistic, ethnic and cultural boundaries. Australia continues to lead the world in organic agriculture hectares. Australia also leads in the increase of organic hectares over the past four years (since the Organics Olympiad 2012) and in the number of WWOOF (Willing Workers on Organic Farms) hosts. Finland leads in organic wild culture hectares. Vietnam leads in organic aquaculture hectares, and Tunisia leads in organic forest hectares. Germany leads in biodynamic hectares, as well as with the number of members of IFOAM-Organics International. India leads for the number of organic producers. The Falkland Islands (Malvinas) leads in terms of the percentage agricultural land dedicated as organic. Switzerland leads with the value of organics consumption per capita. USA leads in the value of the organics market. Denmark leads in the publishing of organics research papers over the past four years. Namibia leads in the percentage increase in organic hectares over the past four years. The overall global organics leaders, on the basis of aggregated scores, are Australia, Germany, and Switzerland, in positions one, two and three, respectively. This study demonstrates the successful global diffusion of organics, and identifies that leadership lessons can be available from a broad diversity of countries. Key implications are identified.","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"
Distributed Hierarchy of Clusters in the Presence of Topological Changes,"We propose an algorithm that builds a hierarchical clustering in a network, in the presence of topological changes. Clusters are built and maintained by random walks, that collect and dispatch information to ensure the consistency of clusters. We implement distributed communication primitives allowing clusters to emulate nodes of an overlay distributed system. Each cluster behaves like a virtual node, and executes the upper level algorithm. Those primitives ensure that messages sent by a cluster are received and treated atomically only once by their recipient, even in the presence of topological changes. Decisions concerning the behavior of the cluster (virtual node for the higher level algorithm) are taken by the node that owns the random walk at this time. Based on this abstraction layer and the overlay network it defines, we present a distributed hierarchical clustering algorithm, aimed at clustering large-scale dynamic networks.",['info']
"Temperature Anomalies and Carbon Dioxide, a Correlation AttemptAnomalies de température et gaz carbonique, une tentative de corrélation","Warming of the global climate is usually correlated with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The sensitivity of global surface temperature to rising CO2 concentration was evaluated over the period 1853 to present. Publicly available datasets were used including temperature anomalies, CO2 concentration, global sea level, oceanic oscillations, solar activity, and magnetic field declination. A specific, statistically significant contribution to global warming of the CO2 atmospheric concentration could not be extracted from the available dataset. While comparing the calculation results from a simple radiative forcing and feedback model with the observed global warming, the CO2 contribution is estimated to be less than 25 to 30% of the total, while other causes contribute for the rest. Thus, the “Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity” is estimated to be at 0.53°C (0.42 to 0.73).Le réchauffement climatique est habituellement mis en corrélation avec la concentration atmosphérique en dioxyde de carbone (CO2). La sensibilité de la température superficielle globale à la concentration en CO2 a été évaluée sur la période de 1853 à nos jours. Des séries de données accessibles au public on été utilisées incluant les anomalies de température, la concentration en CO2, le niveau global des mers, les oscillations océaniques, l'activité solaire, et la déclinaison du champ magnétique. Aucune contribution statistiquement significative au réchauffement global n'a pu être attribuée à la seule concentration atmosphérique en CO2. En comparant le réchauffement observé avec le résultat du calcul d'un modèle simple de forçage radiatif avec rétroaction, la contribution du CO2 est estimée à moins de 25 à 30% du tout, alors que d'autres causes contribuent au reste. Ainsi la ""Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity"" est estimée à 0.53°C (0.42 à 0.73).","['sde', 'phys']"

Plotting Ternary Diagrams by R Library ggtern for Geological Modelling,"Selecting proper methods of data modelling is crucial in geosciences, as effective data visualization enables better understanding of complex geological phenomena: processes, structure and dynamics. Various approaches of the data analysis by R language include both traditional methods of linear charts and other approaches to data visualization: ternaries, circular and radar charts. Using ternaries for triple correlations between variable can be seen in applied geological analysis which proves it to be important method for data modelling. Visualizing geological variables by ternaries enables to highlight correlation between variables in a triangle, how data are dependent and affected. In this study, several geologic, tectonic and geomorphic variables, such as sediment thickness, tectonic plates, volcanic areas, steepness and depths, were tested using R based modelling in {ggtern} library. Other graphs include radar charts and circular diagrams. Visualizing attributes as a triple component correlation by ternaries gives a better insight to the geological factors. Traditional techniques for visualization of pairwise linear correlations are not sufficient to show triple variations. Ternaries approach identifies data correlations by triple factors. Additional graphical models include circular and Euler-Venn diagrams of quantitative and qualitative geospatial data modelling. The study is supported by 7 R code listings and 9 figures.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"

Self-Regulation and Planning Strategies to Initiate and Maintain Physical Activity Among Older People.,"Self-regulation is the capability of the individual to actively decrease the discrepancy between intended behaviour and set goals. General theories of self-regulation such as the Control Theory are supplemented by developmental self-regulatory theories such as the Theory of Selection, Optimisation, and Compensation in explaining the regulation of physical activity (PA). In the context of PA interventions, two important self-regulatory strategies are self-monitoring and planning. There is research indicating that self-regulation interventions effectively promote PA in older adults. However, there is also a body of evidence showing the limitations of these interventions in this age group. Possible interactions of self-regulation capacity with age-related changes in cognition, motivation, as well as physical functioning in the context of PA are discussed.",['sdv']
Geomorphological modelling and mapping of the Peru-Chile Trench by GMT,"The author presents a geospatial analysis of the Peru-Chile Trench located in the South Pacific Ocean by the Generic Mapping Tool (GMT) scripting toolset used to process and model data sets. The study goal is to perform geomorphological modelling by the comparison of two segments of the trench located in northern (Peruvian) and southern (Chilean) parts. The aim of the study is to perform automatic digitizing profiles using GMT and several scripting modules. Orthogonal cross-section profiles transecting the trench in a perpendicular direction were automatically digitized, and the profiles visualized and compared. The profiles show variations in the geomorphology of the trench in the northern and southern segments. To visualize geo- logical and geophysical settings, a set of the thematic maps was visualized by GMT modules: free-air gravity anomaly, geoid, geology and bathymetry. The results of the descriptive statistical analysis of the bathymetry in both segments show that the most frequent depths for the Peruvian segment of the Peru-Chile Trench range from -4,000 to -4,200 (827 recorded samples) versus the range of -4,500 to -4,700 m for the Peruvian segment (1,410 samples). The Peruvian segment of the trench is deeper and its geomorphology steeper with abrupt slopes compared to the Chilean segment. A comparison of the data distribution for both segments gives the following results. The Peruvian segment has the majority of data (23%) reaching 1,410 (-4,500 m to -4,700 m). This peak shows a steep pattern in data distribution, while other data in the neighbouring diapason are significantly lower: 559 (-4,700 m to -5,000 m) and 807 (-4,200 m to -4,400 m). The Chilean segment has more unified data distribution for depths of -6,000 m to -7,000 m.

They brought together up to 165 participants in 6 complementary events: the Preforum at the LF2L-ENSGSI, the RobAFIS 2018 competition at the Faculty of Science and Technology, the 8th AFIS Academy-Industry Forum 2018, the Doctoral Seminar 2018, the AFIS Thesis Prize 2018, the celebration of the 20th anniversary of AFIS and the Gala Dinner of the Forum with the theme ""AFIS celebrates its 20th anniversary""! These meetings provide opportunities for exchanges between academic and industrial communities on the theme of Systems Engineering, its industrial implementation, teaching and related research issues. The unifying theme chosen for this edition was: From the complexity of systems to their acceptance and ease of use. This theme is linked to the expertise, teaching and research in Systems Engineering, developed by the teachers-researchers of the University of Lorraine, organizers of these events. This theme is stated in the form of a paradox, a challenge faced by manufacturers in a context of change from a product economy to a service or even experience economy. How to design systems to control their complexity and ensure simplicity/acceptance of uses? How are Systems Engineering processes and methods impacted by this rationale, how can Systems Engineering facilitate this transition within companies?",['info']
"Thermogravimétrie -Modélisation, cinétique et mécanismes des réactions solide-gaz",Isothermal and isobaric thermogravimetry allows measuring the kinetic rate of chemical transformations of divided or bulk solids. The interpretation of the kinetic curves is based on the separation of time from the thermodynamic variables in the rate équation. &quot;Geometrical&quot; models describing the variations of the speed according to time are presented as well as the tests allowing to verify their hypotheses. The article shows also how to study the &quot;reaction mechanisms&quot; of nucleation and growth from the variations of the kinetic rate with the thermodynamic variables. Numerous examples of reactions of industrial and/or academic interest illustrate the modelling approach as well as the confrontation of the models to the experimental dataLa thermogravimétrie isotherme et isobare permet de mesurer la vitesse de transformation chimique de solides massifs ou divisés. L’exploitation des courbes cinétiques repose sur la séparation des variables temps et des variables thermodynamiques dans l’équation de vitesse. Des modèles « géométriques » décrivant les variations de la vitesse en fonction du temps sont présentés ainsi que les tests permettant de valider leurs hypothèses. L’article montre également comment étudier les «mécanismes réactionnels » de germination et de croissance à partir des variations de la vitesse avec les variables thermodynamiques. De nombreux exemples de réactions d’intérêt industriel et/ou académique illustrent la démarche de modélisation ainsi que la confrontation des modèles aux données expérimentales.,['spi']
Thermogravimétrie - Étude cinétique des réactions dans les systèmes solide-gaz,Thermogravimetry is commonly used for the kinetic study of reactions in heterogeneous gas-solid systems. It allows to elucidate the chemical pathway and obtain the kinetic rate equation and mechanisms. This article presents the background of heterogeneous kinetics necessary to describe the fundamental processes involved in solid-gas transformations. The rate-determining step approximation is reviewed and the resulting general rate equation is presented. This last equation is compared to a simplified equation largely used in the literature data. Lastly the experimental methods for obtaining reliable interpretable kinetic data are reported.La thermogravimétrie est la technique la plus adaptée à l’évaluation de la cinétique des réactions hétérogènes de type solide-gaz. Elle permet d’en expliquer le déroulement pour in fine déterminer l’équation de vitesse et les mécanismes réactionnels. Cet article présente d’abord les éléments de base de la cinétique hétérogène en décrivant les systèmes réactionnels solide-gaz et les processus fondamentaux qui régissent leurs transformations. Le concept de l’étape déterminante est rappelé et l’équation générale de la vitesse qui en découle est précisée. Cette dernière est confrontée à une équation simplifiée mais néanmoins très répandue dans la bibliographie. Enfin les méthodes expérimentales préconisées pour l’obtention de données cinétiques fiables et interprétables sont présentées.,['spi']
Architecture evaluation,"The system analysis process (SEBoK 2012) allows « developers to objectively carry out quantitative assessments of systems in order to select and/or update the most efficient system architecture and to generate derived engineering data ». The goal is here to perform trade-off studies. We focus here on the evaluation of costs, risks or effectiveness of Alternative System Design Solutions (ASDS) provided by the technical systems engineering processes (ISO/IEC 2008) considering two main constraints. First, iterative aspect of design approach induces a growing but uncertain maturity level of detail of the proposed solutions. Second, each decision resulting from evaluations must be argued considering stakeholder’s requirements. It is particularly crucial to note here that these requirements can be more or less contradictory. They can be also relative to various domains and culture such as mechanics, electronics, or computer science. The proposed work aims at giving a methodological guide with embedded tools and innovative decision making methods to support the effectiveness evaluation of ASDS. It is here applied in the field of mechatronic systems analysis. This guide is the subject of methodological, conceptual and technical contributions summarized in the next sections.",['info']
Generic Classification and Representation of Shape Features in Sheet-Metal Parts,"This chapter presents classification and representation of shape features in sheet-metal parts. Shape features in a sheet-metal part model can be associated with volume subtraction from base-sheet (e.g., piercing/blanking operation), deformation/modification of base-sheet or forming operation on base-sheet. The shape features in a sheet-metal part model are classified as (i) Volumetric features and (ii) Deformation features. These features can also be classified as ‘2-dimensional (2D) features’ (volumetric features) and ‘3-dimensional (3D) features’ (deformation features) as a result of modification and forming of base-sheet. The thickness is constant for a sheet-metal part. Hence, the shape features in a sheet-metal part are also referred as constant thickness features. The representation, classification, and extraction procedures of the sheet-metal features are based on topology and geometry. The novelty is that the proposed classification and representation of sheet-metal features is based purely on shape entities and therefore it is possible to automatically extract the features from any sheet-metal part model. This enables the use of the proposed classification and representation to be unambiguous and application independent and to handle equivalences between feature labels and their representations among applications. The definition presented for a feature can also be extended to include application specific information.",['spi']

Development of French as a Foreign Language Teacher’s ‘Teaching Repertoire’ in and through Retrospective Interviews and Reflection,"The retrospective interview carried out as part of foreign language teacher training in France constitutes a complex “polyphonic” (Bakhtin [1975] 1981) situation, where the trainee’s discourse is articulated as a component of “external dialogue” (Vološinov [1929] 1986) with that of the trainer – and sometimes also that of other participating trainees. Each of them refers to, as an element of “internal dialogue” (ibidem), what the trainee said or did in the classroom with and in relation to his / her students as well as what they said or did as action or reaction; that is to say, the classroom interaction in itself can be characterized as an “external dialogue” situation. In focusing on French as a foreign language teacher training, this paper aims to reveal, from a discourse analysis viewpoint, how three elements of retrospective interviews – discourses articulated in relation to each other, the trainee’s retrospective reflection on his/her classroom action and/or his/her students’ (re)actions, and the potential development of his/her ‘teaching repertoire’ – are related to one another.",['shs']

SEISDIP: Dip and Azimuths from 3 Component Vertical Seismic Profiles (3C -VSP).,"SEISDIP TM : Dip and Azimuths from 3 Component Vertical Seismic Profiles (3C -VSP). 3C ( 3 components) oriented with a hardwave device and 3C isotropic recording of the VSP tool ( named “ vector fidelity”). 3C isotropic processing resulting in P-wave polarization measurement of reflected events, P-P or P-S. Improved VSP interpretation from oriented 3C in comparison with standard 1C VSP processing. Applications: Rig-source VSP, all borehole seismic surveys recorded with geophones, especially in complex structural context; O-VSP, VI-VSP, 2D walkaways;3D-VSP. SEISDIP TM : IFP trademark. Rig source VSP surveys are commercially recorded with a single zero-offset source position and with a downhole tool including 3 orthogonal seismic sensors. For VSP acquisition in vertical wells, at least a magnetometer needs to be combined with the VSP tool. “Isotropic” processing of the oriented 3 Components (3C) VSP data means that all the processing operations are identically applied on the 3 components at any seismic time, ensuring the following benefits: the illumination of seismic reflectors is achieved in 3 Dimensions, so that dip and azimuth of reflectors can be derived. 3C VSP yields the structural dip of seismic interfaces from the borehole up to distances of several hundred meters away from the well, even if the reflectors do not intersect the well, or are located below the well. A 3C VSP can be recorded in any well, cased or open hole. In contrast, dip/azimuth from borehole wall imaging tools relate to sedimentary dips with an investigation range of a few centimeters away from the well bore, and can be recorded in open hole only. An early example of a complex VSP case study, entitled “Pre-seisdip case-study” processed in 1989, shows the unique structural solution of a 3C VSP seismic response after difficult orientation: 3C processing was successfully attempted in order to restitute reliable dipping structures, and the corresponding VSPCDP image (Model 4); the O-VSP imaging process was initially achieved with the single vertical component, and performed according to several dip hypotheses (Models 1,2,3), as the interpreter was uncertain about the actual dipping trends of the overburden and of the deep reservoir interval from the available surface seismic images and other borehole data…",['phys']

Pre-service Teachers' Scientific Explanation with e-scaffolding in Blended Learning,"This study aims to examine the effect of e-scaffolding in blended learning on pre-service teachers' scientific explanation abilities as well as to find out the patterns of scientific explanation of pre-service teachers who learn by e-scaffolding in blended learning. This study employed mixed-method with concurrent embedded design. Quasi-experimental research design in the form of a one-group pretest-posttest control group design was used as a quantitative approach, whereas the learning process and scientific explanation patterns were described in a qualitative approach. The population of this study was 152 elementary school pre-service teachers of a state university at Malang, while the sample was 24 elementary school pre-service teachers in the seventh semester. The sample selection technique in the study was purposive sampling. The instrument used for measuring scientific explanation abilities was problem descriptions. The quantitative data were analyzed using the t-test, while qualitative data were analyzed using descriptive method. The finding of the study indicated that pre-service teachers' scientific explanation improved after learning with e-scaffolding in blended learning. The pre-service teachers were able to explain the relationship between theory and problems very well. The recommendation for future research, it is crucial to investigate the characterization of scientific explanation.",['shs']
Wind Turbine Fault Detection System in Real Time Remote Monitoring,"In new energy development, wind power has boomed. It is due to the proliferation of wind parks and their operation in supplying the national electric grid with low cost and clean resources. Hence, there is an increased need to establish a proactive maintenance for wind turbine machines based on remote control and monitoring. That is necessary with a real-time wireless connection in offshore or inaccessible locations while the wired method has many flaws. The objective of this strategy is to prolong wind turbine lifetime and to increase productivity. The hardware of a remote control and monitoring system for wind turbine parks is designed. It takes advantage of GPRS or Wi-Max wireless module to collect data measurements from different wind machine sensors through IP based multi-hop communication. Computer simulations with Proteus ISIS and OPNET software tools have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the studied system. Study findings show that the designed device is suitable for application in a wind park.","['info', 'spi', 'phys']"

Mining economist opinions on using multi-agent methodology to simulate metal markets,"In coming years, mining economists expect the international demand for metals to rise. Market distortions are likely to appear, because producing countries controlling the resources can implement exportation quotas for certain categories of metals. Consequently , consuming countries like France face increasing risks of shortages of some metals. In response, the French government suggests that a set of prospective tools be implemented, including a prospective simulation tool based on a multi-agent system approach. The goal of this paper is to report and discuss critiques by mining economists on the value and abilities of multi-agent systems (MAS) to simulate critical metal markets whenever the approach is appropriate. The critiques are collected by confronting an existing agent-based computational economics (ACE) model of the lithium market with market reality and then by applying the discussions generally to other metals. The motivation is (a) to define the gaps currently existing between MAS and mining (b) to provide indicators on how the ACE model should be enhanced to reduce these gaps and (c) to produce an improved initial metal classification that is suitable for such a modelling exercise.",['info']
A faster numerical scheme for a coupled system modeling soil erosion and sediment transport,"Overland flow and soil erosion play an essential role in water quality and soil degradation. Such processes, involving the interactions between water flow and the bed sediment, are classically described by a well-established system coupling the shallow water equations and the Hairsine-Rose model. Numerical approximation of this coupled system requires advanced methods to preserve some important physical and mathematical properties; in particular the steady states and the positivity of both water depth and sediment concentration. Recently, finite volume schemes based on Roe’s solver have been proposed by Heng et al. (2009) and Kim et al. (2013) for one and twodimensional problems. In their approach, an additional and artificial restriction on the time step is required to guarantee the positivity of sediment concentration. This artificial condition can lead the computation to be costly when dealing with very shallow flow and wet/dry fronts. The main result of this paper is to propose a new and faster scheme for which only the CFL condition of the shallow water equations is sufficient to preserve the positivity of sediment concentration. In addition, the numerical procedure of the erosion part can be used with any well-balanced and positivity preserving scheme of the shallow water equations. The proposed method is tested on classical benchmarks and also on a realistic configuration.","['info', 'math', 'spi', 'phys']"
Distance-Based Phylogeny Reconstruction: Safety and Edge Radius,"A phylogeny is an evolutionary tree tracing the shared history, including common ancestors, of a set of extant species or “taxa”. Phylogenies are increasingly reconstructed on the basis of molecular data (DNA and protein sequences) using statistical techniques such as likelihood and Bayesian methods. Algorithmically, these techniques suffer from the discrete nature of tree topology space. Since the number of tree topologies increases exponentially as a function of the number of taxa, and each topology requires a separate likelihood calculation, it is important to restrict the search space and to design efficient heuristics. Distance methods for phylogeny reconstruction serve this purpose by inferring trees in a fraction of the time required for the more statistically rigorous methods. Distance methods also provide fairly accurate starting trees to be further refined by more sophisticated methods. Moreover, the input to a distance method is the matrix of pairwise evolutionary distances among taxa, which are estimated by maximum likelihood, so that distance methods also have sound statistical justifications.",['info']
Isotopic Abundance Ratio Analysis of Biofield Energy Treated Indole Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,"The objective of the current experiment was to evaluate the effect of biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM (2H/1H or 13C/12C or 15N/14N) in indole using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The sample of organic compound indole was divided into two parts - one part was designated as a control sample (untreated), and another part was considered as biofield energy treated sample, which was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment (The Trivedi Effect®). The biofield energy treated indole sample was analyzed at different time intervals and were symbolized as T1, T2, T3, and T4 to understand the effect of the biofield energy on isotopic abundance ratio with respect to the time. From the GC-MS spectra, the presence of the molecular ion peak C8H7N+ (m/z 117) along with major fragmented peaks C7H6+ (m/z 90), C7H5+ (m/z 89), C5H3+ (m/z 63), C4H2+ (m/z 50), C3H3+ (m/z 39), and C2H4 (m/z 28) were observed in both control and biofield treated samples. Only, the relative peak intensities of the fragmented ions in the biofield treated indole was notably changed as compared to the control sample with respect to the time. The isotopic abundance ratio analysis of indole using GC-MS revealed that the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM in the biofield energy treated indole at T1 and T2 was significantly decreased by 44.28 and 28.18% as compared to the control sample. On the contrary, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM in the biofield energy treated sample at T3 and T4, was significantly increased by 41.22 and 180.88%, respectively as compared to the control sample. Overall, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM (2H/1H or 13C/12C or 15N/14N) was significantly altered in the biofield energy treated indole as compared to the control with respect to the time. The biofield treated indole with the altered isotopic abundance ratio might have altered the physicochemical properties and rate of reaction. This biofield energy treated indole might be more useful as a chemical intermediate in the production of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, plastics, dyes, and perfumes.",['sdv']

R scripting libraries for comparative analysis of the correlation methods to identify factors affecting Mariana Trench formation,"Mariana trench is the deepest place on the Earth. It crosses four tectonic plates of the Pacific Ocean: Mariana, Caroline, Pacific and Philippine. The formation of the trench is caused by the complex interconnection of various environmental factors. The aim of this study was to describe and characterize various impact factors affecting formation of the Mariana trench geomorphology and continental margin environments using R programming language and mathematical algorithms of correlation methods written on R code. To record the system of geological, tectonic, geographic, oceanological and bathymetric features affecting Mariana trench , a combination of statistical methods, GIS and R programming codes were applied. The questions answered are as follows: which factors are the most influencing for the Mariana trench morphology, and to what extend do they affect its development? Is sedimental thickness of the ocean trench basement more important factors for the trench formation comparing to the steepness slope angle and aspect degree? Three methods of computing were tested: Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Kendall correlation, numerical correlogram, correlation matrix and cross-correlatios to analyze environmental impact factors. The correlogram matrices are computed and visualized by R scripting libraries. Complex usage of programming tools, mathematical statistics and geospatial analysis enabled to get a differentiated understandings of the hadal environments of the Mariana trench. The results revealed following three types of factors having the highest score: geometric (tg° slope angle), geologic (sedimental thickness) and tectonic structure. The results furthermore indicated that tectonic plates, sedimental thickness of the trench basement and igneous volcanic areas causing earthquakes play the most essential role in the geomorphology of the trench.",['info']
"Seagrass mapping and monitoring along the coast of Crete, Greece","The seagrasses, a unique group of aquatic plants, create complex, extremely diversified and productive eco- logical systems in the littoral coastal zones. The only flowering plant in the world that is able to live com- pletely submerged, seagrasses play vital role in the marine ecosystems of the World Ocean. Seagrasses are the most important component in the environmental food chain of the coastal ecosystems, being a vital food source for various marine species (e.g. fish, dugongs, turtles, swans), and a producer of organic matter, which is the very basis of the food web. The P.oceanica seagrass is an endemic for the Mediterranean region, and a main species in the marine coastal environment of Greece. Meadows of P.oceanica are subjected to the human activities, because they occur in coastal areas, where they are affected both by anthropogenic and by climatic and environmental factors. Nowadays P.oceanica is in the alarming state of regression, because of the deterioration of the environment in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to these reasons, P.oceanica is a protected species since 1988 in some Eu- ropean countries (France). Monitoring P.oceanica is therefore an important contribution to the saving and protecting the environment of Mediterranean region. The current MSc thesis focuses on the monitoring of seagrass P.oceanica along the northern coasts of Crete Island, Greece, and investigates the application of the remote sensing techniques for the seagrass mapping. This research was articulated in two parts, where the first one involves an ecological approach to the seagrass distribution in various regions around the globe and the experience of seagrass monitoring nowadays. The second part of this work has technical character and investigates the application of the remote sensing tech- niques towards seagrass mapping. It, furthermore, focuses on the optical properties of the P.oceanica and other seafloor cover types, and studies distinguishability of various seafloor cover types. Studies of the opti- cal characteristics of separate seafloor cover types were made with purpose to clarify, whether their spectral properties change with varying environmental conditions. Special attention has been drawn on the role of environmental factors on the distribution of P.oceanica along the coasts of Crete, and in particular, how the optical properties of the seafloor cover types, i.e. spectral reflectance, are being changed under varying external conditions, e.g. water column, amount of suspended particles and sediments in the seawater, and water temperature. For this purpose we studied differences in the spectral reflectance of P.oceanica and other bottom cover types at three distinct depths. The diverse spectral values entail variations in optical properties of the seafloor cover types at changing environmental conditions. We applied WASI Water Color Simulator (WASI) simulation techniques for the modelling of the optical parameters of various seafloor cover types by various spaceborne imaging spectrometers (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)), in order to understand their suitability and possible limitations for the seagrass mapping. Fieldwork research sites were presented by separate locations on the northern coast of Crete region (Ligaria, Agia Pelagia, Xerocampos). The additional measurements of the reflectance spectra of the seawater with and without sediments have been made in aquarium tank in 2009 by means of Trios-RAMSES spectroradiome- ter. Parallel to the collection of spectra signatures, we captured the imagery for the seagrass mapping, which consists of the aerial images from the Google Earth website and the satellite Landsat TM and ETM+ scenes.","['info', 'phys', 'sde', 'shs']"

"Development of an Infrared Thermography Method with CO2 Laser Excitation, Applied to Defect Detection in CFRP","This paper presents a NDT by infrared thermography with excitation CO2 Laser, wavelength of 10.6 μm. This excitation is the controllable heating beam, confirmed by a preliminary test on a wooden plate 1.2 m x 0.9 m x 1 cm. As the first practice, this method is applied to detecting the defect in CFRP heated by the Laser 300 W during 40 s. Two samples 40 cm x 40 cm x 4.5 cm are prepared, one with defect, another one without defect. The laser beam passes through the lens of a deviation device, and heats the samples placed at a determinate position and area. As a result, the absence of adhesive can be detected. This method displays prominently its application as NDT with the composite materials. This work gives a good perspective to characterize the laser beam, which is very useful for the next detection campaigns.",['spi']
Defects detection by infrared thermography with a new microwave excitation system,"This study presents a NDT method using infrared thermography associated with a microwave excitation. The advantages of such stimulation lie in the volumic absorption of incoming waves which lead to a greater sounded depth. This method is applied to two types of samples. The first is a concrete slab reinforced with CFRP on which a bonding failure is inserted and the second is a wooden plate on which a metallic insert is placed on the back face. The device generating the microwaves is made of a commercial magnetron associated with a pyramidal horn antenna. An infrared camera is placed on the same side as the stimulated surface and thermograms are recorded at regular intervals. The whole assembly is placed in a protective room against high frequencies. The incident power density leads to heating of less than 1 ◦C of the surface of the samples. The thermograms show a higher temperature rise in front of the defect area. The non-uniformity of the beam, leads us to treat the thermograms with an algorithm of contrast. These first results show the interest of the microwave excitation to detect defects deeper than in the case of surface excitation.",['spi']
Steel detection in reinforced concrete wall by microwave infrared thermography,This paper presents a NDT by infrared thermography with a microwave excitation system. The advantages of such stimulation lie in the volumetric absorption of incoming waves which lead to a greater sounded depth. The device generating the microwaves was made of a commercial magnetron 800 W at 2.45 GHz associated with a pyramidal horn antenna. This method was applied to detect the steel reinforcements (deformed bar 12 mm of diameter placing at every 10 cm) in a concrete specimen (1 m×1 m×6.5 cm) with a concrete cover of 3.8 cm. The specimen was heated with an average power of 600 W for 5 min. An infrared camera was placed on the same side as the stimulated surface and thermograms were recorded at regular intervals. The whole assembly was placed in a protective enclosure against high frequency electromagnetic fields. The method based on a contrast algorithm was used to analyze the thermogram series. The result shows a higher temperature rise in front of the steel reinforcement areas. The effect of microwave caused an increase in moderate temperature does not lead to alteration of inspected concrete.,"['spi', 'phys']"
"Analysis of Physical, Thermal, and Structural Properties of Biofield Energy Treated Molybdenum Dioxide","Molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) is known for its catalytic activity toward reforming hydrocarbons. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of biofield energy treatment on physical, thermal, and structural properties in MoO2. The MoO2 powder sample was divided into two parts, one part was remained as untreated, called as control, while the other part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment and called as treated. Both control and treated samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The XRD data exhibited that the biofield treatment has altered the lattice parameters, unit cell volume, density and molecular weight of the treated sample as compared to the control. The TGA study revealed that the onset temperature of thermal degradation of MoO2 was reduced from 702.87°C to 691.92°C. Besides, the FT-IR spectra exhibited that the absorption band corresponding to Mo=O stretching vibration was shifted to lower wavenumber i.e. 975 cm-1 (control) to 970 cm-1 in treated sample. Hence, above results suggested that biofield energy treatment has altered the physical, thermal, and structural properties in MoO2 powder. Therefore, the biofield treatment could be applied to modify the catalytic properties of MoO2 in pharmaceutical industries.",['phys']
Impact of Biofield Treatment on Atomic and Structural Characteristics of Barium Titanate Powder,"Barium titanate, perovskite structure is known for its high dielectric constant and piezoelectric properties, which makes it interesting material for fabricating capacitors, transducer, actuator, and sensors. The perovskite crystal structure and lattice vibrations play a crucial role in its piezoelectric and ferroelectric behavior. In the present study, the barium titanate powder was subjected to biofield treatment. Further, the control and treated samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and Electron spin resonance (ESR). The XRD analysis showed the permanent compressive strain of 0.45% in treated barium titanate powder as compared to control. Furthermore, the biofield treatment has enhanced the density upto 1.38% in barium titanate as compared to control. The FT-IR spectra showed that the stretching and bending vibrations of Ti-O bond in treated BaTiO3 were shifted towards lower frequency as compared to control. The bond length was substantially increased by 0.72 % in treated BaTiO3 as compared to control. The ESR spectra of control and treated BaTiO3 sample showed the g-factor of 2.0; and biofield treatment has substantially changed the width and height of ESR signal in treated BaTiO3 as compared to control. These observations revealed that biofield treatment has significantly altered the crystal structure, lattice strain, and bond vibration of barium titanate.",['phys']
Influence of Biofield Treatment on Physicochemical Properties of Hydroxyethyl Cellulose and Hydroxypropyl Cellulose,"Cellulose based polymers have shown tremendous potential as drug delivery carrier for oral drug delivery system (DDS). Hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) are widely explored as excipients to improve the solubility of poorly water soluble drugs and to improve self-life of dosage form. This work is an attempt to modulate the physicochemical properties of these cellulose derivatives using biofield treatment. The treated HEC and HPC polymer were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The XRD studies revealed a semi-crystalline nature of both the polymers. Crystallite size was computed using Scherrer’s formula, and treated HEC polymer showed a significant increase in percentage crystallite size (835%) as compared to the control polymer. This higher increase in crystallite size might be associated with greater crystallite indices causing a reduction in amorphous regions in the polymer. However treated HPC polymer showed decrease in crystallite size by -64.05% as compared to control HPC. DSC analysis on HEC polymer revealed the presence of glass transition temperature in control and treated HEC polymer. We observed an increase in glass transition temperature in treated HEC, which might be associated with restricted segmental motion induced by biofield. Nonetheless, HPC has not showed any glass transition. And no change in melting temperature peak was observed in treated HPC (T2) however melting temperature was decreased in T1 as compared to control HPC. TGA analysis established the higher thermal stability of treated HEC and HPC. CHNSO results showed significant increase in percentage oxygen and hydrogen in HEC and HPC polymers as compared to control samples.

If we consider all protein structures that have ever been solved, the immense structural space of protein-protein interactions needs to be organised systematically in order to make sense of the many functional and evolutionary relationships that exist between different protein families and their interactions. This article describes some new developments in Kbdock, a knowledge-based approach for classifying and annotating protein interactions at the protein domain level.",['info']
"Evaluation of Biofield Treatment on Physical, Atomic and Structural Characteristics of Manganese (II, III) Oxide","In Mn3O4, the crystal structure, dislocation density, particle size and spin of the electrons plays crucial role in modulating its magnetic properties. Present study investigates impact of Biofield treatment on physical and atomic properties of Mn3O4. X-ray diffraction revealed the significant effect of biofield on lattice parameter, unit cell volume, molecular weight, crystallite sizes and densities of treated Mn3O4. XRD analysis confirmed that crystallinity was enhanced and dislocation density was effectively reduced by 80%. FTIR spectroscopic analysis revealed that Mn-O bond strength was significantly altered by biofield treatment. Electronic spin resonance analysis showed higher g-factor of electron in treated Mn3O4 as compared to control, along with altered spin-spin atomic interaction of Mn with other mixed valance states. Additionally, ESR study affirmed higher magnetization behaviour of the treated Mn3O4. The results demonstrated that treated Mn3O4 ceramic could be used as an excellent material for fabrication of novel magnetic data storage devices.",['phys']
Spectroscopic Characterization of Chloramphenicol and Tetracycline: An Impact of Biofield Treatment,"Objective: Chloramphenicol and tetracycline are broad-spectrum antibiotics and widely used against variety of microbial infections. Nowadays, several microbes have acquired resistance to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment for spectroscopic characterization of chloramphenicol and tetracycline using FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Methods: The study was performed in two groups (control and treatment) of each antibiotic. The control groups remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treatment groups. Results: FT-IR spectrum of treated chloramphenicol exhibited the decrease in wavenumber of NO2 from 1521 cm-1 to 1512 cm-1 and increase in wavenumber of C=O from 1681 cm-1 to 1694 cm-1 in acylamino group. It may be due to increase of conjugation effect in NO2 group, and increased force constant of C=O bond. As a result, stability of both NO2 and C=O groups might be increased in treated sample as compared to control. FT-IR spectrum of treated tetracycline showed the downstream shifting of aromatic C-H stretching from 3085-3024 cm-1 to 3064-3003 cm-1 and C=C stretching from 1648-1582 cm-1 to 1622-1569 cm-1 and up shifting of C-N stretching from 965 cm-1 to 995 cm-1. It may be due to enhanced conjugation effect in tetracycline, and increased force constant of C-N (CH3) bond of tetracycline as compared to control. The results indicated the enhanced stability of treated tetracycline as compared to control. UV-Vis spectra of biofield treated chloramphenicol and tetracycline showed the similar lambda max (λmax) to their respective control. It revealed that the chromophore groups of both antibiotics remained same as control after the biofield treatment. Conclusion: Based on FT-IR spectroscopic data, it is speculated that due to increase in bond strength and conjugation effect after biofield treatment, the chemical stability of both the drugs might be increased as compared to control.",['sdv']
Phenotypic and Biotypic Characterization of Klebsiella oxytoca: An Impact of Biofield Treatment,"Klebsiella oxytoca (K. oxytoca) is a Gram-negative microbe generally associated with community and hospital-acquired infections. Due to its clinical significance, we evaluated the effect of biofield treatment on phenotype and biotype characteristics of K. oxytoca (ATCC 43165). The study was performed into three groups i.e. C (control), T1 (treatment, revived); and T2 (treatment, lyophilized). Subsequently, groups T1 and T2 were received biofield treatment and control group was remained as untreated. The antimicrobial sensitivity results showed 3.33% and 6.67% alteration in antimicrobials susceptibility in group T1 cells on day 5 and 10, respectively, and 3.33% alteration in antimicrobials susceptibility was observed in group T2 cells on day 10 as compared to control. The sensitivity patterns of cefazolin were changed from resistant (R) to intermediate (I) on day 5, and resistance (R) to susceptible (S) on day 10, in T1 cells of K. oxytoca. The MIC value of cefazolin was decreased by 2-fold in group T1 on day 10 as compared to control. The biofield treated K. oxytoca exhibited the changes in biochemical reactions about 3.03% and 15.15% of total tested biochemicals in group T1 cells on day 5 and 10, respectively as compared to control. The biotype number of K. oxytoca was altered in biofield treated group and organism identified as Raoultella ornithinolytica in T1 on day 10 as compared to control, which is the prominent finding of this study. These changes were found in treated bacteria that might be due to some alteration happened in metabolic/enzymatic pathway and/or at genetic level of K. oxytoca. Based on these data, it is speculated that biofiled treatment could be an alternative approach that can improve the effectiveness of the existing antimicrobials against the resistant pathogens.",['sdv']
Evaluation of Isotopic Abundance Ratio in Biofield Energy Treated Nitrophenol Derivatives Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,"Nitrophenols are the synthetic organic chemicals used for the preparation of synthetic intermediates, organophosphorus pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM, and PM+2/PM in o- and m-nitrophenol using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The o- and m-nitrophenol were divided into two parts - one part was control sample, and another part was considered as biofield energy treated sample, which received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment (The Trivedi Effect®). The biofield energy treated nitrophenols having analyzed at different time intervals were designated as T1, T2, T3, and T4. The GC-MS analysis of both the control and biofield treated samples indicated the presence of the parent molecular ion peak of o- and m-nitrophenol (C6H5NO3+) at m/z 139 along with major fragmentation peaks at m/z 122, 109, 93, 81, 65, and 39. The relative peak intensities of the fragmented ions in the biofield treated o- and m-nitrophenol were notably changed as compared to the control sample with respect to the time. The isotopic abundance ratio analysis using GC-MS revealed that the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM in the biofield energy treated o-nitrophenol at T2 and T3 was significantly increased by 14.48 and 86.49%, respectively as compared to the control sample. Consequently, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+2/PM in the biofield energy treated sample at T2 and T3 was increased by 11.36, and 82.95%, respectively as compared to the control sample. Similarly, in m-nitrophenol, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM in the biofield energy treated sample at T1, T3, and T4 was increased by 5.82, 5.09, and 6.40%, respectively as compared to the control sample. Subsequently, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+2/PM at T1, T2, T3 and T4 in the biofield energy treated m-nitrophenol was increased by 6.33, 3.80, 16.46, and 16.46%, respectively as compared to the control sample. Overall, the isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM (2H/1H or 13C/12C or 15N/14N or 17O/16O), and PM+2/PM (18O/16O) were altered in the biofield energy treated o- and m-nitrophenol as compared to the control increased in most of the cases. The biofield treated o- and m-nitrophenol that have improved isotopic abundance ratios might have altered the physicochemical properties and could be useful in pharmaceutical and chemical industries as an intermediate in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and other useful chemicals for the industrial application.",['sdv']

METAPHORICAL CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF THE BODY IN PSYCHOPATOLOGY AND POETRYConceitualizações do corpo em psicopatologia e em poesia,"The goal of our study is to identify several conceptualizations of the body expressed in the contexts of psychopathology and literature. We propose a specific categorization of literary sentences drawing on Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; 1999) and Context-Limited Simulation Theory (Ritchie 2003; 200; 2008). Based on corpus data, we show that in psychiatric manuals the physical body is always reasoned in metaphoric terms of the BODY-CONTAINER category, thus with a high degree of non-specific attributes. In psychoanalysis manuals, the body is represented by "" sexual-sensual sentences "" or by abstract "" notions "". Italian poetry offers an additional representation of the body with special focus on the organs and other body parts like "" heart, "" hand(s) "" , "" face "" , but also "" blood "" , "" chest "" , "" arm(s), "" "" eye(s) "" , "" breast(s) "" , "" head, "" "" flesh, "" "" skin "". Keywords: literary construction of the body; conceptual metaphors of the body; context-limited simulation theory; linguistic metaphors of the body; psychosomatics; representation of the body; literary sentences of the body.

Studies of the Atomic and Crystalline Characteristics of Ceramic Oxide Nano Powders after Bio field Treatment,"Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been known for their extraordinary electrical and magnetic properties. In the present study, some transition metal oxides (Zinc oxide, iron oxide and copper oxide) which are widely used in the fabrication of electronic devices were selected and subjected to biofield treatment. The atomic and crystal structures of TMOs were carefully studied by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. XRD analysis reveals that biofield treatment significantly changed the lattice strain in unit cells, crystallite sizes and densities in ceramics oxide powders. The computed molecular weight of the treated samples exhibited significant variation. FT-IR spectra indicated that biofield treatment has altered the metal-oxygen bond strength. Since biofield treatment significantly altered the crystallite size, lattice strain and bond strength, we postulate that electrical and magnetic properties in TMOs (transition metal oxides) can be modulated by biofield treatment.",['phys']
Near-threshold fatigue propagation of physically through-thickness short and long cracks in a low alloy steel,"In this paper, the near-threshold fatigue behavior of physically through-thickness short cracks and of long cracks in a low alloy steel is investigated by experiments in ambient air. Physically through-thickness short fatigue cracks are created by gradually removing the plastic wake of long cracks in compact tension specimens. The crack closure is systematically measured using the compliance variation technique with numerical data acquisition and filtering for accurate detection of the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack opening. Based on the experimental results, the nominal threshold SIF range is shown to be dependent on the crack length and the characteristic of the crack wake which is strongly dependent on the loading history. The effective threshold SIF range and the relation between the crack propagation rate and the effective SIF range after the crack closure correction are shown to be independent on crack length and loading history. The shielding effect of the crack closure is shown to be related to the wake length and load history. The effective threshold SIF range and the relationship between the crack growth rate and the effective SIF range appear to be unique for this material in ambient air. These properties can be considered as specific fatigue properties of the couple material/ambient air environment.",['phys']
Multinational Corporations (MNCs) and Enterprises (MNEs),"This article focuses on key characteristics of multinational companies (MNCs) in a global business environment. After the definition of the multinational company, the authors present an overview of the geographic origin of MNCs and trends concerning foreign direct investments (FDI). They analyze location strategies followed by MNCs and explain the growing importance of MNCs from emerging economies. Several theoretical perspectives contribute to a better understanding of MNCs: industrial organization theory, transaction cost theory, organizational capability theory, contingency theory, business network theory and institutionalization theory. A typology of different conceptualizations (heterarchical, transnational and meta-national companies) emphasizes their heterogeneous and changing character. Recent trends highlight the increasing fragmentation of the value-chain and the development of ‘global factories’.",['shs']

"Impact of Biofield Treatment on Physical, Structural and Spectral Properties of Antimony Sulfide","Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) has gained extensive attention in solar cells due to their potential as a low-cost and earth abundant absorber material. In solar cell absorber, the optoelectrical properties such as energy band gap and absorption coefficient of Sb2S3 play an important role, which have strong relationships with their crystal structure, lattice parameter and crystallite size. Hence in the present investigation, Sb2S3 powder samples were exposed to biofield treatment, and further its physical, structural and spectral properties are investigated. The particle size analysis showed larger particle size and surface area after treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed polycrystalline orthorhombic structure with superior crystallinity in treated Sb2S3 along with significant changes in the lattice parameters, which led to changes in unit cell volume and density. XRD data analysis indicates that crystallite size was increased by around 150% in treated sample. In FT-IR spectra, strong absorption band was observed at 400-700cm-1, which confirms the presence of Sb2S3. Further, the absorption peak intensity in IR spectra was significantly reduced after treatment that was probably due to change in metal sulphur dipolar interaction.",['phys']

La construction de modes de consommation d'énergie par la relation-client développée par les fournisseurs d'énergie,"La réduction de l’intensité énergétique est l’un des objectifs phares de la politique énergétique en France (- 2 % par an d’ici à 2015 puis - 2,5 % par an jusqu’en 2030). La diminution de la consommation de près de 20 % à l’horizon 2020 est un des leviers d’action pour atteindre cet objectif. Comment inciter les ménages à réaliser des économies d’énergie ? La « théorie du comportement planifié » est un outil susceptible d’aider les pouvoirs publics dans la recherche de solutions efficaces à cette question. Cette théorie fournit en effet des informations qui montrent qu’à l’heure actuelle les ménages français ne semblent pas encore disposés à adopter un comportement économique en matière de consommation énergétique. Quatre facteurs peuvent expliquer cette situation. Parmi ces derniers : le caractère vital de l’électricité confère aux consommateurs un sentiment d’impuissance face à la gestion de l’énergie ; et l’absence de normes explicites qui justifieraient un « bon » niveau de consommation minimise la pression sociale sur les clients.",['shs']

Multidimensional precarity: a challenge for young people,"Background: The economic downturn combined with the ongoing process of target segmentation of the work force have made increasingly difficult the access and the integration of young people in the labour market. A general worsening of job quality and under-qualification practises for new entrants are amongst the most marked features. Italian and French comparison shows how conjectural and structural factors force them to face precariousness with strategies based on personalised trajectories. Objective: The study aims at showing how precariousness affect youth careers and which dynamics they activate to achieve professional and personal expectations. We plan to explain how job precarity and life uncertainty concern subjective dimension, which depends on both socio-demographic characteristics and temporal-geographical perspective. Method: We shall investigate youth employment conditions through standardized dimensions and subjective perceptions. Cross-sectional analysis based on European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions will provide quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis based on semi-structured interviews of Italian and French people aged 20-35 having different levels of education, social origin and gender. Results: In Italy and France, both the level of education and familial background occurred to explain intergenerational inequalities in work trajectories. In both countries, women are more educated and look for fulfilling jobs. They are more likely to use training to keep developing their abilities and accept temporary jobs. Men suffer more the lack of job continuity and perceive spells in unemployment like a personal defeat. They are oriented to economic satisfaction around their thirties. Active policies are factors boosting job attachment although widespread disaffiliation feelings, which are more evident among youth from lower social classes and living in the Southern regions of both countries. Conclusion: Because of job precariousness and life uncertainty young people develop individual mechanisms to achieve a compromise between creative dynamic work search and passive acceptation of job precariousness.",['shs']
"Prevalence and factors associated with medical drug purchase in the streets of Port-au-Prince, HaitiPrévalence et facteurs associés à l'achat des médicaments de rue par la population de Port au Prince, Haiti","In Haiti, street vendors sell freely all kinds of medical drugs that are frequently bought and consumed by the general population. Recent campaigns led by the National Health Ministry failed to eradicate this practice. In addition, no formal study was conducted to better understand this phenomenon. The aims of this survey were to evaluate the prevalence of medical drug purchase in the streets by the Haitian population and to determine the factors associated with this practice. A cross-sectional study was conducted among the Haitian population living in Port-au-Prince, the country’s Capital. A questionnaire based interview was passed to voluntary participants to evaluate whether or not they have bought medical drugs sold in the streets and to determine the underlying reasons. Variables such as age, gender and education level were tested as possible factors associated with this practice. Two hundred and eighty-one (281) individuals accepted to answer the questionnaire. The mean age of the study population was 30 years [18–63] for 50.9% females and 49.1% males. 70.5% of the respondents had bought medical drugs in the streets. Those who admitted this practice bought them “often” to “all the time” (54.5%), voluntarily (74.2%) and in self-medication (95.5%) since they had no time to see a physician (45.7%). They mainly bought non-opioid analgesics (79.3%), antibiotics (54%), vitamins and minerals (17.7%) and antihistamines (9.6%). These drugs were bought because they were more available (80.2%) and cheaper than in pharmacies (45.7%). The interrogated persons persisted in this practice although they think these drugs were not safe (70.6%) and not well preserved (72.1%). 69% of them think these drugs are mostly expired while 73.6% remember to verify that. Although 83.2% of them believe that selling medication drugs in the streets is not normal, 45.2% still recommend others to buy them. Illiterates and persons with elementary school level were more likely to buy drugs in the streets than those with high school or University level (Odds Ratio = 3.1, P = 0.003). Buying drugs in the streets is an abnormal practice fueled by lack of education and poor access to medical care and drugs sold in pharmacies. It persists despite a certain doubt in the safety of these drugs. An effective awareness program needs to be implemented in Haiti to eradicate this practice and prohibit medical drug selling in the streets.En Haïti, les vendeurs de rue vendent librement toutes sortes de médicaments qui sont fréquemment achetés et consommés par la population en général. Les récentes campagnes menées par le ministère de la Santé national n'ont pas réussi à éradiquer cette pratique. De plus, aucune étude formelle n'a été menée pour mieux comprendre ce phénomène. Les objectifs de cette enquête étaient d'évaluer la prévalence de l'achat de médicaments dans la rue par la population haïtienne et de déterminer les facteurs associés à cette pratique. Une étude transversale a été menée auprès de la population haïtienne vivant à Port-au-Prince, la capitale du pays. Une entrevue basée sur un questionnaire a été transmise aux participants volontaires pour évaluer s'ils ont acheté ou non des médicaments vendus dans la rue et pour déterminer les raisons sousjacentes. Des variables telles que l'âge, le sexe et le niveau d'éducation ont été testées comme facteurs possibles associés à cette pratique. Deux cent quatre-vingt et une (281) personnes ont accepté de répondre au questionnaire. L'âge moyen de la population étudiée était de 30 ans [18-63] pour 50,9% des femmes et 49,1% des hommes. 70,5% des répondants avaient acheté des médicaments dans la rue. Ceux qui ont admis cette pratique les achètent «souvent» à «tout le temps» (54,5%), volontairement (74,2%) et en automédication (95,5%) puisqu'ils n'ont pas le temps de consulter un médecin (45,7%). Ils achètent principalement des analgésiques non opiacés (79,3%), des antibiotiques (54%), des vitamines et minéraux (17,7%) et des antihistaminiques (9,6%). Ces médicaments sont achetés parce qu'ils sont plus disponibles (80,2%) et moins chers qu'en pharmacie (45,7%). Les interrogés persistent dans cette pratique bien qu'ils pensent que ces médicaments ne sont pas sûrs (70,6%) et pas bien conservés (72,1%). 69% d'entre eux pensent que ces médicaments sont en grande partie expirés alors que 73,6% se souviennent de le vérifier. Bien que 83,2% d'entre eux croient que la vente de médicaments dans la rue n'est pas normale, 45,2% recommandent toujours aux autres de les acheter. Les analphabètes et les personnes ayant un niveau de scolarité élémentaire étaient plus susceptibles d'acheter des médicaments dans la rue que ceux ayant un niveau d'études secondaire ou universitaire (rapport de cotes = 3,1, p = 0,003). L'achat de drogues dans les rues est une pratique anormale alimentée par le manque d'éducation et le manque d'accès aux soins médicaux et aux médicaments vendus dans les pharmacies. Il persiste malgré un certain doute sur la sécurité de ces médicaments. Un programme de sensibilisation efficace doit être mis en oeuvre en Haïti pour éradiquer cette pratique et interdire la vente de médicaments dans les rues.",['shs']

The proposed Converter Nonlinear Fuzzy Controller (CNFC) is based on a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model and on a control model which allows the electrical system to which the PMSG is connected to be taken into account. Some sufficient conditions for robust stabilization of the TS fuzzy model were derived and have been formulated using a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) format. Obtained performances have been compared with those obtained with Linear Quadratic method (LQ). The control model is a simplified model of the whole system performances which captures the dynamics that are important for the synthesis of the CNFC. The proposed controller methodology is finally demonstrated through the proposed model to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",['spi']
Nonlinear Fuzzy Control Based on Fuzzy Anti-Windup of VSC-HVDC Embedded into AC Grid,"In this work, new robust fuzzy control based on model recovery anti-windup strategy based on robust fuzzy anti-windup is proposed for disturbances of multivariable High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) link embedded with AC grid subject to a wide range of parameter uncertainties. Saturations on both control and the states are also taken into account. This work concentrates on the fault ride-through capability of the AC embedded HVDC system which may be exploited to improve the stability of the AC embedded HVDC system. The developed robust control scheme is demonstrated to be effective for temporary short-circuit conditions. The algorithm utilizes fuzzy systems based on “Takagi-Sugeno” fuzzy models to represent a nonlinear AC embedded HVDC system. Sufficient conditions are derived for robust stabilization in the sense of Lyapunov stability and are formulated with linear matrix inequalities to obtain controller gains and anti-windup gains. First, a nonlinear robust fuzzy controller is designed subject to a disturbance with parameter uncertainties. Next, an additional anti-windup is designed to mitigate the adverse effects due to state and the control constraints. The proposed control system is compared with alternative frameworks existing in the literature based on robust control via simulations performed with MATLAB software, to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",['spi']
On the Origin of Trust: Struggle for Secure Cryptography,"Cryptographic primitives, like encryption schemes, hash functions... are the core of most security applications. But the trust that users place in these algorithms has been repeatedly violated. There are many examples of attacks which exploit weaknesses of the underlying cryptographic primitives, like the recent Logjam and Sloth attacks against TLS. So when can we trust cryptography? It should be clear that we cannot trust algorithms which do not have public design rationale and which have not been thoroughly studied. Most notably, the primitives recommended by the cryptographic community are those which have been chosen after an international competition. Within such an open contest, like the AES and the SHA-3 selection processes, all proposals have been carefully analyzed by all participants; their security margins have been evaluated. This ongoing cryptanalytic effort is the only reliable security argument to consider when deciding which primitive to trust.",['info']
"The passéist, modernist and futurist features of some social housing ensembles built during the transitional period of 1960-1970: the case of the Maurelette in Marseille","The history of architecture and urbanism is classically represented as a sequence of major doctrines. However, the well-known architectural ""-isms "" are bound together with productions of the so-called "" transitional "" periods, the legacy of which deserves special scientific interest. A significant number of these kinds of "" in-between product "" in the field of social housing was built during the 1960s and 1970s, between the periods of modernism and postmodernism. At the end of the 1980s in many European countries, particularly in France, massive renovation processes were started, which continue to this day. Due to political, social and aesthetic changes, a great deal of postwar residential heritage has been radically reconstructed or demolished. This process touches not only ordinary residential groups (so-called grands ensembles), but also harms some of the more interesting ensembles. Many of them are undervalued and have not been rehabilitated since their creation, with some often doomed to disappear. The current paper is an attempt to analyse the historical, urban and morphological aspects of the Maurelette residential complex, built in the northern suburbs of Marseille during 1963-1965. The design particularities of the Maurelette complex demonstrate the ambition to create a "" non-ordinary "" ensemble using ordinary and inexpensive construction means and materials. The original interpretation of the traditional square, street and rampart could be considered as early applications of postmodernist ideas of free "" expression "" of historical urban forms. This case study intends to raise awareness about the heritage constructed between the major architectural periods, which deserve to be included in the contemporary urban structure without negating or altering their authentic concept. Its existence will contribute to the continued urban environment, thereby making the modern city more resilient.",['shs']
Robust Control of VSC-HVDC System with Input and States Constraints,"This paper proposes a robust control strategy for a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC), in order to improve the dynamic behavior performance under a wide range of operating conditions, parameters uncertainties, input and state constraints. It proposes first to model the HVDC and investigates the robust control based on Model Recovery Anti-windup (MRAW) to improve regional performance and stability of HVDC systems with saturating actuators. More precisely, in this paper sufficient conditions based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) are derived for robust stabilization, in the sense of Lyapunov method. First, a robust controller is designed to show a desirable nominal performance by ignoring states and control inputs constraints. Next, an additional compensator is designed to mitigate the adverse effects due to state and the control constraints. The proposed strategy validations are performed using a MATLAB/Simulink software.",['spi']

Optimal spatial scale for local region-based active contours,"Recently, there has been a reinvestigation of the use of local statistics by the image segmentation community in a variational framework. Locality is generally defined by means of an isotropic spatial kernel. These recent studies show a better behavior of local models on images with strong intensity inhomogeneities. Thus local segmentation models have become very popular. Very little work, however, has been carried out to address the problem of the choice of the local kernel's scale (or bandwidth). The present contribution falls within this context. Specifically, we investigate the problem of the estimation of a single scale (i.e. pixel independent) for local parametric region segmentation models. The approach is generic and straightforward. The method is demonstrated on synthetic and realistic simulations of ultrasound images with intensity inhomogeneities.",['info']

Dense and Low-Rank Gaussian CRFs Using Deep Embeddings,"In this work we introduce a structured prediction model that endows the Deep Gaussian Conditional Random Field (G-CRF) with a densely connected graph structure. We keep memory and computational complexity under control by expressing the pairwise interactions as inner products of low-dimensional, learnable embeddings. The G-CRF system matrix is therefore low-rank, allowing us to solve the resulting system in a few milliseconds on the GPU by using conjugate gradient. As in G-CRF, inference is exact, the unary and pairwise terms are jointly trained end-to-end by using analytic expressions for the gradients, while we also develop even faster, Potts-type variants of our embeddings. We show that the learned embeddings capture pixel-to-pixel affinities in a task-specific manner, while our approach achieves state of the art results on three challenging benchmarks, namely semantic segmentation, human part segmentation, and saliency estimation. Our implementation is fully GPU based, built on top of the Caffe library, and is available at https://github.com/ siddharthachandra/gcrf-v2.0.",['info']

Linking a Social Identity to an IP Address,"Linking a social identity such as a name to an IP address is generally believed to be difficult for an individual with no dedicated infrastructure or privileged information. Although an individual’s ISP has access to this information, it is kept private except in the case of a legal decision. Similarly, some big Internet companies such as Facebook and Google might be privy to this information but it will never be communicated as it is an industrial secret used for targeted advertisements. In the context of the bluebear project, we show that it is possible for an individual to inconspicuously make the link between social identity and IP address for all Skype users.",['info']
Logical Networks: Self-organizing Overlay Networks and Overlay Computing Systems,"We propose foundations for generic overlay networks and overlay computing systems. Such overlays are built over a large number of distributed computational agents, virtually organized in colonies or virtual organizations, and ruled by a leader (broker) who is elected democratically (vox populi, vox dei) or imposed by system administrators (primus inter pares). Every agent asks the broker to log in the colony by declaring the resources that can be offered (with variable guarantees). Once logged in, an agent can ask the broker for other resources. Colonies can recursively be considered as evolved agents who can log in an outermost colony governed by another super-leader. Communications and routing intra-colonies goes through a broker-2-broker PKI-based negotiation. Every broker routes intra- and inter- service requests by filtering its resource routing table, and then forwarding the request first inside its colony, and second outside, via the proper super-leader (thus applying an endogenous-first-estrogen- last strategy). Theoretically, queries are formulæ in first-order logic equipped with a small program used to orchestrate and synchronize atomic formulæ (atomic services). When the client agent receives notification of all (or part of) the requested resources, then the real resource exchange is performed directly by the server(s) agents, without any further mediation of the broker, in a pure peer-to-peer fashion. The proposed overlay promotes an intermittent participation in the colony, since peers can appear, disappear, and organize themselves dynamically. This implies that the routing process may lead to failures, because some agents have quit or are temporarily unavailable, or they were logged out manu militari by the broker due to their poor performance or greediness. We aim to design, validate through simulation, and implement these foundations in an overlay network computer system. (From [Liquori-Cosnard TGC-07 paper]).",['info']

A Novel Approach for Detail-Enhanced Exposure Fusion Using Guided Filter,"In this paper we propose a novel detail-enhancing exposure fusion approach using nonlinear translation-variant filter (NTF). With the captured Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) images under different exposure settings, first the fine details are extracted based on guided filter. Next, the base layers (i.e., images obtained from NTF) across all input images are fused using multiresolution pyramid. Exposure, contrast, and saturation measures are considered to generate a mask that guides the fusion process of the base layers. Finally, the fused base layer is combined with the extracted fine details to obtain detail-enhanced fused image. The goal is to preserve details in both very dark and extremely bright regions without High Dynamic Range Image (HDRI) representation and tone mapping step. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the proposed method is also suitable for the multifocus image fusion without introducing artifacts.",['info']

EMPHASIZING PHENOMENOLOGY AS A RESEARCH PARADIGM FOR INTERPRETING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION,"Evidence from researches emanating from Nigeria in the field of mathematics education has revealed an over-reliance on broad methods of empirical inquiry. There seem to be a general stereotypical restriction on approaches to conducting investigation across the noble discipline, thereby stifling the spirit of innovation, open-mindedness and scholarly inquisitiveness. This discourse is premised on the possibility that obtaining better answers to inquiries may rest largely in qualitative approaches that rely more on the subjects of the inquiries than on the pre-conceptions of the inquirer. Phenomenology as a qualitative approach to research in mathematics education seek to interpret the multiple constituents of consciousness and the numerous cognitive and affective dimensions of the contending issues, trends, progress, prospects and challenges of the profession. In phenomenology, the aim of the researcher is to describe as accurately as possible the phenomenon, reframing from any pre-given framework, but remaining true to the essence as seen from the perspectives of the people involved. The fundamental submission of this paper therefore, is the need to extensively adopt empirical phenomenology to unearth and interpret the growth and development of mathematics education in Nigeria.","['math', 'shs']"

The quest of vertical flight: the development of helicopter,"The dream of flight, first developed by the observation of nature, was inspired from birds and insects. However, the whirling fall and glide of seeds from trees like the sycamore, allowing a wide dissemination of the specie, is an alternative way of flight. That is probably the origin of conception of the Chinese top (reported by Ge Hong circa 400 BC), which is a small toy consisting in two blades attached to a stick, which rotation between the hands of an operator, generates lift and its vertical flight. The idea of using blade rotation, to fly a machine carrying a man, was developed by Leonardo da Vinci at the end of the XVth Century. The development of the helicopter is a step-by-step story resulting from original design ideas, fundamental aerodynamics theories and innovative technical solutions. That course benefitted the internal combustion engine improvements, because of the large power-to-weight ratios needed, and the emergence of light and high-strength materials, but the key of a practical helicopter relied in its control, addressed by the elaboration of the complex mechanical system of the rotor head.",['shs']

"Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Isotopic Abundance of 13C, 2H, and 18O in Biofield Energy Treated p-tertiary Butylphenol (PTBP)","p-tert-Butyphenol (PTBP) is a phenolic monomer used in the synthesis of numerous industrially useful chemicals. The current research work aimed to evaluate the effect of the biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance ratios of PM+1/PM and PM+2/PM in PTBP using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The sample, PTBP was distributed into two parts - one part was designated as control PTBP and another part was considered as biofield energy treated PTBP. The biofield energy treatment was achieved through unique biofield energy transmission process by Mr. Trivedi (also known as The Trivedi Effect®). T1, T2, T3, and T4 were indicated to the different time interval analysis of the biofield treated PTBP. The GC-MS spectra of the both control and biofield treated PTBP showed the presence of molecular ion peak [M+] at m/z 150 (calculated 150.10 for C10H14O) along with eight major fragmented peaks at m/z 135, 107, 95, 91, 77, 65, 41, and 39, which might be due to C10H15+, C7H7O+ or C8H11+, C6H7O+, C7H7+, C6H5+, C5H5+, C3H5+, and C3H3••+ ions, respectively. The relative intensities of the parent molecule and other fragmented ions of the biofield treated PTBP were altered as compared to the control PTBP. The percentage in the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+1/PM was enhanced in the biofield treated PTBP at T2, T3 and T4 by 1.60%, 3.57%, and 120.13%, respectively while it was decreased by 4.14% in the treated sample at T1 with respect to the control PTBP. Consequently, the isotopic abundance ratio of PM+2/PM was increased in the biofield treated PTBP at T1, T3, and T4 by 1.28%, 2.56%, and 123.08%, respectively with respect to the control sample. On the other hand, it was reduced in the biofield treated sample at T2 by 1.28% as compared to the control PTBP. Concisely, 13C, 2H, and 17O contributions from (C10H14O)+ to m/z 151 and 18O contribution from (C10H14O)+ to m/z 152 in the biofield treated PTBP were changed with respect to the control sample and was found to have time dependent effect. The biofield energy treated PTBP might display isotope effects such as different physicochemical and thermal properties, rate of the reaction, selectivity and binding energy due to the changed isotopic abundance ratio as compared to the control sample. Biofield treated PTBP could be valuable for the designing new chemicals and pharmaceuticals through using its kinetic isotope effects.",['sdv']

Biofield Treatment: An Alternative Approach to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Susceptibility Pattern of Raoultella ornithinolytica,"Raoultella ornithinolytica is belongs to the family of Enterobacteriaceae, a Gram-negative encapsulated aerobic bacillus associated with bacteremia and urinary tract infections. As biofield therapy is increasingly popular in biomedical heath care, so present study aimed to evaluate the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment on antimicrobial sensitivity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), biochemical study, and biotype number of multidrug resistant strain of R. ornithinolytica. Clinical sample of R. ornithinolytica was divided into two groups i.e. control and biofield treated which were analyzed for the above parameters using MicroScan Walk-Away® system on day 10 after treatment. Antimicrobial sensitivity assay results showed a significant increase (60.71%) in sensitivity pattern of antimicrobials i.e. changed from resistant to susceptible while 10.71% of tested antimicrobials changed from intermediate to susceptible as compared to control. MIC results showed a significant decrease in MIC values of 71.88% tested antimicrobials as compared to control. Biochemical reaction study showed 15.15% alteration in different biochemical such as cetrimide, cephalothin, kanamycin, and ornithine after biofield treatment as compared to control. A significant change in biotype number (7775 4370) was also observed with organism identified as Klebsiella oxytoca after biofield treatment as compared to control (7775 5372). Overall results conclude that biofield treatment could be used as complementary and alternative treatment strategy against multidrug resistant strain of R. ornithinolytica with respect to improve the sensitivity and reduce the MIC values of antimicrobials. Hence, it is assumed that biofield treatment might be a suitable cost effective treatment strategy in near future, which could have therapeutic value in patients suffering from multidrug resistant pathogens.",['sdv']
The Rapanui Diaspora on Tahiti. Pamatai Lands as a Memorial Settlement,"When commercial flights between Rapa Nui and Tahiti began in 1968, after nearly 70 years of colonial confinement, a new migratory process began from Rapa Nui to Tahiti. This included claims of ownership of the Pamatai lands, bought 80 years earlier by a group of 25 Rapanui’s immigrants. For the Rapanui people the history of the Pamatai lands evokes a series of memories and forgetfulness, the genealogical ties as well a constant search for the linkage with Tahiti—a “memory of diaspora”. In this paper I analyze the history of links between Rapanui people and Tahiti and the role of Pamatai’s land in the Rapanui migration process: the exodus during nineteenth century, confinement on Easter Island, the broken link with Tahiti, and Rapanui claims for ownership of the Pamatai lands after the 1970s.",['shs']
Fluid Structure Interaction of Yacht Sails in the Unsteady Regime,"The dynamic Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) of yacht sails submitted to a harmonic pitching motion is numerically investigated to address both issues of aerodynamic unsteadiness and structural deformation. The model consists in an implicit dynamic coupling algorithm between a Vortex Lattice Method model for the aerodynamics and a Finite Element Method model for the structure dynamics. It is shown that the dynamic behaviour of a sail plan subject to yacht motion clearly deviates from the quasi-steady theory. The aerodynamic forces oscillate with phase shifts with respect to the motion. This results in hysteresis phenomena, which show aerodynamic equivalent damping and stiffening effects of the unsteady behaviour. The area of the hysteresis loop corresponds to the amount of energy exchanged by the system and increases with the motion reduced frequency and amplitude. In the case of a rigid structure, the aerodynamic forces oscillations and the exchanged energy are lower than for a flexible structure.",['spi']

Link with classical computational methods based on FEM models of cells was done for both the periodic solution and wave based approach (SAFE, WFE).

Safety part design optimisation based on the finite elements method and a genetic algorithm,"This paper deals with a numerical approach for improving the mechanical properties of a safety belt anchor by optimizing its shape and the manufacturing process by using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-2). This kind of automotive component is typically manufactured in three stages: blanking, rounding of the edges by punching and finally bending (90°). This study focuses only on the rounding and bending processes. The numerical model is linked to the genetic algorithm (GA) in order to optimize the shape of the part and the process parameters. This is implemented by using ABAQUS© script files developed in the Python programming language and CATIA© script files in VBScript. The algorithm modifies the part’s design parameters in the CAD system, imports the model in STEP format into ABAQUS CAE and starts the Finite Elements Analysis (FEA) automatically. The material behaviour is modelled using a specific Lemaitre material damage formulation implemented in ABAQUS© via a FORTRAN user subroutine. The influence of two process parameters (the die radius and the rounding punch radius) and five shape parameters on the component behaviour is investigated. The search for the optimum component design depends on three objective functions which are (i) the material damage state at the end of the forming process, (ii) the von Mises stress field and (iii) the maximum von Mises stress in the folded zone. A global optimisation is finally performed in order to improve the ultimate unbending load and the volume of the safety part. This work has two major areas of innovation: (a) the improvement of the genetic algorithm NSGA-2; and (b) the development of an integrated numerical procedure including “Computer aided design” and “mechanical finite element simulation” controlled by the genetic algorithm.",['spi']

Very High Cycle Fatigue for single phase ductile materials: slip band appearance criterion,"The DISFAT project is a French project financially supported by the French National Agency for Research (ANR). It aims at a deeper understanding of mechanisms leading to crack initiation in metals and alloys under Very High Cycle Fatigue loading (VHCF). The VHCF regime is associated with stress magnitudes lower than the conventional fatigue limit and as a result, numbers of cycles higher than 109. Tests were carried out using an ultrasonic technique at loading frequency of 20 kHz. In the case of pure copper polycrystals, we previously showed that slip band (SB) activity and intrinsic dissipation were closely related. Dissipation and slip band amount increased with the number of cycles. At very small stress amplitudes, no slip band appeared at the specimen surface up to 108 cycles but the material was found to dissipate energy. These results revealed that the material never reached a steady state and so could break at higher number of cycles. In this paper, the morphology and the location of slip bands were characterized. Different types of slip bands depending on the stress amplitudes appeared at the specimen surface. The stress amplitude required to show the first slip bands decreases with the number of cycles. It is twice lower than the stress amplitude required to break the specimen for the same number of cycles. At the smallest stress amplitudes, slip bands were mostly found at twin boundaries. Quasi 3D finite element simulations taking into account the polycrystalline nature of the material emphasized the key role of the elastic anisotropy in slip band initiation. A criterion for slip band appearance was finally proposed.",['spi']
Error localization and updating of junction properties for an engine cradle model,"Extending the bandwidth of validity of FEM models used in vibroacoustic design is a generic objective of model generation processes.

Classically, an SHM process can be performed in four steps: detection, localization, classi cation and quanti cation. This paper addresses damage quanti cation issue as a classi cation problem whereby each class corresponds to a certain damage extent. Starting from the assumption that damage causes a structure to exhibit nonlinear response, we investigate whether the use of nonlinear model based features increases classi cation performance. A support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to perform multi-class classi cation task. Two types of features are used as inputs to the SVM algorithm: Signal Based Features (SBF) and Nonlinear Model Based Features (NMBF). SBF are rooted in a direct use of response signals and do not consider any underlying model of the test structure. NMBF are computed based on parallel Hammerstein models which are identi ed with an Exponential Sine Sweep (ESS) signal. A study of the sensitivity of classi cation performance to the noise contained in output signals is also conducted. Dimension reduction of features vector using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is carried out in order to nd out if it allows robustifying the quanti cation process suggested in this work. Simulation results on a cantilever beam with a bilinear torsion spring sti ness are considered for demonstration. Results show that by introducing NMBF, classi cation performance is improved. Furthermore, PCA allows for higher recognition rates while reducing features vector dimension. However, classi ers trained on NMBF or on principal components appear to be more sensitive to output noise than those trained on SBF.",['spi']
"Flow of yied stress fluids through porous media : simulations, experiments and applications","A Yield Stress fluids injection porosimetry Method (YSM) has recently been developed as a simple potential alternative to the extensively used Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). Its main advantage is the use of a nontoxic fluid instead of mercury used in MIP. Using this method, the Pore Size Distribution (PSD) of a porous medium is obtained by measuring the flow rate / pressure gradient relationship obtained by injecting a yield stress fluid in the porous medium. The principle of the method and some experimental results obtained using this technique will be presented and will be compared to those obtained by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). In the Yield Stress fluid injection porosimetry method, the main assumption is that the porous medium is described as a bundle of straight capillaries of circular cross-section following a given pore size distribution. This simple model is revisited by introducing both non-circular and axially varying cross-sections. Two key points are tackled using numerical simulations: the flow onset at minimal pressure drop and the variation of the flow rate vs the pressure gradient. These results are finally used to show that the flow rate / pressure gradient relationship of a yield stress fluid through a porous medium can be more closely predicted using a bundle of capillaries of irregular cross-sections rather than using the classical bundle of straight circular capillaries.",['spi']
Phase transformation in AISI 304 stainless steel during in situ biaxial loading in SEM and with X-ray diffraction,"Finally, the same in situ biaxial tensile tests were also performed with both SEM and XRD, first at low temperature in order to study the influence of temperature on the material behaviour and especially on martensite formation, and then on the same steel that was heat treated in order to increase its grain size and to study the grain size effect.",['spi']
Early Detection of Progressive Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Severity Index,"Study Design. Early detection of progressive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) was assessed based on 3D quantification of the deformity. Objective. Based on 3D quantitative description of scoliosis curves, the aim is to assess a specific deformation pattern that could be an early detectable severity index for progressive AIS. Summary of Background Data. Early detection of progressive scoliosis is important for adapted treatment to limit progression. However, progression risk assessment is mainly based on the follow up, waiting for signs of rapid progression that generally occur during the growth peak. Methods. 65 mild scoliosis (16 boys, 49 girls, Cobb Angle between 10 and 20°) with a Risser between 0 and 2 were followed from their first exam until a decision was made by the clinician, either considering the spine as stable at the end of growth (26 patients) or planning to brace because of progression (39 patients). Calibrated bi-planar X-rays were performed and 3D reconstructions of the spine allowed to calculate six local parameters related to main curve deformity. For progressive curve 3D phenotype assessment, data were compared to those previously assessed for 30 severe scoliosis (Cobb Angle > 35°), 17 scoliosis before brace (Cobb Angle > 29°) and 53 spines of non-scoliosis subjects. A predictive discriminant analysis was performed to assess similarity of mild scoliosis curves either to those of scoliosis or non-scoliosis spines, yielding a severity index (S-index). S index value at first exam was compared to clinical outcome. Results. At the first exam, 53 out of 65 predictions (82%) were in agreement with actual clinical outcome. 89 % of the curves that were predicted as progressive proved accurate Conclusion. Although still requiring large scale validation, results are promising for early detection of progressive curves.","['sdv', 'spi']"
Micromechanical modelling of viscoelastic-viscoplastic-damage behaviour for polyamide woven fabric composites under cyclic loading.,"In this paper, a micromechanics model, based on the periodic homogenization method, is utilized to study thermoplastic woven composites. The proposed approach accounts for the microtructure effects and the local behaviour of the matrix accounting for viscoelastic, viscoplastic and damage phenomena. The damage mechanisms occurring into the yarns are modelled through a hybrid micro-phenomenological constitutive law based on the Mori-Tanaka mean field theory. Finally, the model capabilities have been illustrated under both monotonic and oligocyclic loading conditions.",['spi']
A generic decision support tool to planning and assignment problems: Industrial application & Industry 4.0,"Decision support tools are essential to help the management of industrial systems at different levels: strategic to size the system; tactical to plan activities or assign resources; operational to schedule activities. We present a generic and modular decision support tool to solve different problems of planning, assignment, scheduling or lot-sizing. Our tool uses a hybridization between a metaheuristic and a list algorithm. The specification of the considered problem is considered into the list algorithm. Several tactical and operational problems have been solved with our tool: a problem of planning activities with resources assignment for hospital systems, a lot-sizing and scheduling problem taking into account the setup time for plastic injection, and a scheduling problem with precedence constraints. At the strategic level, this tool can also be used as part of the Industry 4.0 to design reconfigurable production systems.

Thermomechanically coupled model for non-proportional loading in SMAS,"In this work, a new 3D thermomechanically coupled phenomenological model is proposed for SMAs. SMA behavior is described through several strain mechanisms, each associated with its proper internal variables. Forward and reverse transformation are allowed to take place simultaneously with martensite variants reorientation. This model is built to capture the particular behavior of SMAs when subjected to complex loading, namely non-proportional thermomechanical loading. The effect of thermomechanical coupling, related to dissipation and latent heat is examined by means of conducting simulations under various thermal conditions. The validity of the model is demonstrated by approaching experimental results of complex thermomechanical loading paths of SMA structures.",['spi']
Fatigue behaviour of two-phase titanium alloy in VHCF regime,"This paper is focused on fatigue crack initiation and early growth in two-phase titanium alloy VT3-1 (similar to Ti-6Al-4V) under VHCF loads. The material was produced by two different processes: forging and extrusion. Each kind of material was investigated under three different loading types (push-pull, pull-pull and fully reversed torsion). Fracture surfaces of the tested specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for getting information on crack initiation sites and surrounded fracture surface zones. The results of such analysis were compared with microstructure of the titanium alloy for establishing a crack initiation and early crack growth mechanisms. It was found that crack initiation in this alloy is caused by single or an agglomeration (“cluster”) of alpha-platelets. Under fully reversed tension the fatigue life seems to depend on the geometry of alpha-platelets clusters whereas under tension tension loading such dependence was not observed. However, materials with larger alpha-platelets clusters (macro-zones) have a lower VHCF resistance. The comparison of tension and torsion VHCF test results show a higher slop of the S-N curve under torsion than under tension for both forged and extruded titanium alloys. Nonetheless, some similarities in crack initiation and propagation scenarios were outlined between tension and torsion loadings.",['spi']
Creep Forming of an Al-Mg-Li Alloy for Aeronautic Application,Creep forming of Al-Mg-Li alloy sheets is studied. An instrumented bulging machine is used to form a double curvature panel at a reduced scale. The deformation of the work-sheet is ensured by a 7475 aluminum alloy lost sheet deformed by a gas pressure applied on its upper surface. A numerical model using the ABAQUS software is developed in order to obtain the pressure law and to ensure the forming conditions during the cycle. This model is validated by comparing experiments and numerical results in terms of deformed shape and thickness evolution.,['spi']
Numerical simulation of the effect of adiabatic temperature increase in martensitic transformation of austenitic steels,"This work presents a constitutive model for metastable austenitic steels exhibiting Strain Induced Martensitic Transformation (SIMT). Based on the description of the kinetics of phase transformation proposed by Olson and Cohen [3], and later generalized to 3D by Stringfellow et al. [7] and Papatriantafillou et al. [4], this model includes the effect of temperature increase on the kinetics of SIMT and on the thermal softening of the phases. This allows capturing relevant phenomena exhibited by metastable austenitic steels when subjected to plastic deformation at high strain rates. A systematic procedure for the identification of the constitutive parameters has been proposed. The predictions of the constitutive description are compared with experiments for the austenitic steel AISI 304 provided by Rodríguez-Martínez et al. [6]. Good correlation between experiments and modelling are achieved in terms of macroscopic strain-stress curves and volume fraction of martensite formed during straining.",['spi']
Toward on-line robot vibratory modes estimation,"This paper is concerned with preliminaries results on robot vibratory modes on-line estimation. The dominating oscillatory mode of the robot arm is isolated by comparing the robot position given by the motors encoders and an external measure at the tool-tip of the robot arm. In this article the external measurement is provided by a laser tracker. The isolation of the oscillation permits to identify the vibratory mode, i.e. the natural frequency and the damping ratio of the undesired phenomena. Here we propose a comparison between the algebraic method and the sliding modes for the parameter identification. This comparison is motivated by the fact that both methods provide finite time convergence. Experimental identifications are proposed on a 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulator robot, St¨aubli RX-170B.","['info', 'math']"
Analysis of laser–melt pool–powder bed interaction during the selective laser melting of a stainless steel,"The laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) or powder-bed additive layer manufacturing process is now recognized as a high-potential manufacturing process for complex metallic parts. However, many technical issues are still to overcome for making LPBF a fully viable manufacturing process. This is the case of surface finish and the systematic occurrence of porosities, which require postmachining steps. Up till now, the porosity origin remains unclear but is expected to be related to the stability of the process. As a LPBF part is made by the accumulation of hundreds of meters of small weld beads, it also appears to be important to understand all the phenomena that occur during the laser-powder-melt pool (MP) interaction for each single track. For this reason, in the first part of our study, using an instrumented LPBF setup and a fast camera analysis (>10 000 image/s), single tracks were fabricated and analyzed in real time and postmortem. Spatters ejections and powder denudation phenomena were observed together with variations of melt pool dimensions and melt-pool instabilities. In turn, the physical origin of this powder denudation and the dynamics of the MP were investigated and discussed.",['spi']
What can be learnt about dispersivity from transport experiments in unsaturated double-porosity soils?,"Dispersivity is assumed to be an intrinsic property which characterizes the heterogeneity scale of porous media. When the medium is unsaturated by two fluid phases (water and air), dispersivity depends strongly on the saturation. “Double-porosity” medium concept can be attributed to a class of heterogeneous soils and rocks in which a strong contrast in local pore size characteristics is observed. In this work, we revisited the intrinsicity of the dispersivity of a double-porosity soil with different saturations, by performing a series of one-dimensional experiments of chloride tracer dispersion under different boundary conditions. The physical double-porosity model was composed of solidified clayey balls, distributed periodically in a more permeable sandy matrix. The dependence of the dispersivity on the saturation in the double-porosity soil was established and compared with the trends obtained for the single-porosity soils in previous studies. RÉSUMÉ Il est généralement admis que la dispersivité est une propriété intrinsèque qui caractérise l'échelle d'hétérogénéité des milieux poreux. Lorsque le milieu est saturé par deux phases fluides (eau et air), elle dépend fortement de la saturation. Le concept du milieu à « double-porosité » peut être attribué à une classe de sols et de roches hétérogènes dans lesquels on observe un fort contraste de tailles caractéristiques locales de pores. Dans ce travail, nous avons revisité la nature intrinsèque de dispersivité d'un sol à double porosité avec des saturations différentes, en effectuant une série d'expériences unidimensionnelles de la dispersion d’un traceur, pour différentes conditions aux limites. Le modèle physique à double porosité a été composé de sphères argileuses solidifiées, réparties périodiquement dans une matrice de sable plus perméable. La dépendance de la dispersivité de la saturation dans le sol à double porosité a été établie et comparée avec les tendances obtenues pour les sols à simple-porosité dans des études antérieures.",['spi']
Implementation of a damage evolution law for dual-phase steels in Gurson-type models,"This paper is a contribution to the phenomenological modeling of damage evolution in DP steels in the framework of Gurson's approach. It is based on recent results of X-ray tomography in-situ tensile tests and subsequent one-dimensional metallurgical void nucleation models proposed in [C. Landron et al., Scripta Materialia 63 (2010) 973–976]. A macroscopic void nucleation law for DP steels is proposed, covering a wide range of stress triaxialities. The respective effects of nucleation, growth and coalescence are clearly separated. Validations with respect to experimental porosity measurements were performed for several monotonic loading cases and for two loading sequences involving large strains and strain-path changes.",['spi']

Use of a Virtual Environment to Engage Motor and Postural Abilities in Elderly Subjects With and Without Mild Cognitive Impairment (MAAMI Project),"Objectives: In the context of rehabilitation, the use of new technology such as Virtual Reality Technology (VRT) offers multiple possibilities to modulate the functional stimulation of subjects according to needs.Material and methods: In this study, the validity and reliability of our VRT system were investigated in fifteen healthy aged adults (HAA) and seven aged subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One implicit session was designed through two virtual environments (VEs) in order to induce the adapted activities associated with balance and postural control. In comparison, the same activities were achieved in explicit sessions with a physiotherapist. This cross-over study made use of a qualitative method to collect participants’ feelings in both implicit and explicit sessions.Results: The results allowed us to validate the embedded technologies in our system and also the VE features for MCI subjects and their healthy counterparts. The analysis of participants’ feelings showed that implicit tasks were preferred to explicit ones.Conclusion: This study highlighted that the use of VRT generated a competitive spirit in all participants.

Combined effect of damage and plastic anisotropy on the ductility limit of thin metal sheets,"It is well known that both damage and plastic anisotropy strongly affect the ductility limit of thin metal sheets. Due to the manufacturing processes, initial defects, such as inclusions and voids, are commonly present in the produced sheet metals. Plastic anisotropy is a direct outcome of the rolling process, where the resulting metal sheets exhibit preferred crystallographic orientations or strong texture. In the present study, the combined effect of plastic anisotropy and damage on localized necking is numerically investigated and analyzed. To this aim, an improved version of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) constitutive framework is used to model the mechanical behavior of the studied sheet. This version, which is an extension of the original GTN model, incorporates Hill’s anisotropic yield function to take into account the plastic anisotropy of the matrix material. Particular attention is devoted to the derivation of the analytical tangent modulus associated with this constitutive model. This extended GTN model is successfully coupled with bifurcation theory to predict sheet metal ductility limits, which are represented in terms of forming limit diagrams (FLDs). The effect of some material parameters (e.g.,anisotropy parameters of the metallic matrix) on the shape and the location of the predicted FLDs is then investigated and discussed through numerical simulations.",['spi']
Cyclic loading effects on NITI alloys under biaxial conditions,"In this work, the influence of the direction and the history of thermomechanical loading of NiTi shape memory alloys on the overall material behavior is experimentally investigated. In the first part, cyclic biaxial mechanical loading has been applied to cross-shaped specimens under constant temperature. The residual strains of selected points from the sample surface are extracted and analyzed. The second part of the study concerns thermomechanical testing of textured samples cut from a laminated plate under complex cyclic loading at different temperature levels. The evolution of residual strains and the transformation threshold are correlated to the history of loading and the amplitude of transformation strain. Anisotropic effects are studied by performing those same experiments on different directions according to the rolling direction of the laminated plate.",['spi']
Trust on the Internet : How the French ccTLD.FR Went From a Remarkable to a Speculative System,"The Domain Name System (DNS), was invented in 1983 because it was too hard for the human brain to memorize IP addresses. The DNS works as a phone directory, setting a link between letters, the domain name, and an IP address. Layered and structured since its creation, the domain name made it possible to identify the linked resource and to have confidence in its content. However, this classification system was quickly replaced a big bang of naming possibilities, where the first comer is the first and sole served. This survey aims to study the repercussing of the naming rules of the French ccTLD, the .FR. As an introduction and in section I, we will see how an area of trust has been created through the “.FR”. Then, through the section III and IV, how the easing of registration and use rules initiated confusion over the identification and trust by the domain name. Finally, we propose three ways to create the identification-trust link.",['shs']
Finding Yourself on the Internet : proposing a Fait and Reliable System,"Communication over the Internet is via resources identified by an IP address. Because it is complicated to memorize it, a domain name system was invented. Reading from right to left,domain names are used to identify a computer resource. Originally conceived as a unique identifier allows the link-trust, the domain name system was quickly misappropriated and given place to intense speculation. So, anyone can be anyone on the Internet. Registering a domain name in .COM, .FR or .DOCTOR is easy and does not require any documents. This domain name sales system has created a lucrative marketplace with ICANN, the regulator of domain names. Similarly, it is not possible today to identify with certainty the truth of the information on the Internet according to the domain name used. Thus, a teenager wishing to obtain information on voluntary termination of pregnancy will not be able to identify with certainty a source regarded as neutral.In France, the offense of digital obstruction was thus created. We will first see the system of domain names and their usefulness in the identification of a resource on the Internet. We will define in a second step the lucrative market of domain names and the consequences detrimental to the user. Finally, we propose a fair and reliable identification system, based on the tree of Diderot and d'Alembert",['shs']
Signal-based versus nonlinear model-based damage sensitive features for delamination quantification in CFRP composites,"Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an emerging technology designed to automate the inspection process undertaken to assess the health condition of structures. The SHM process is classically decomposed into four sequential steps: detection, localization, classification, and quantification. In this paper, SHM quantification step is addressed. Particularly, we approach delamination quantification as a classification problem whereby each class corresponds to a certain damage extent. Starting from the assumption that damage causes a structure to exhibit nonlinear response, we investigate whether the use of nonlinear model based features increases classification performance. A support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to perform multi-class classification task. Two types of features are used to feed the SVM algorithm: Signal Based Features (SBF) and Nonlinear Model Based Features (NMBF). SBF are rooted in a direct use of response signals and do not consider any underlying model of the test structure. NMBF are computed based on parallel Hammerstein models which are identified with an Exponential Sine Sweep (ESS) signal. Dimensionality reduction of features vector using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is also carried out in order to find out if it allows robustifying the quantification process suggested in this work. Experimental results on Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composite plates equipped with piezoelectric elements and containing various delamination severities are considered for demonstration. Delamination-type damage is introduced into samples in a calibrated way using Laser Shock Wave Technique (LSWT) and more particularly symmetrical laser shock configuration. LSWT is chosen as an alternative to conventional damage generation techniques such as conventional impacts and Teflon inserts since it allows for a better calibration of damage in type, depth and size. Results show that by introducing NMBF, classification performance is improved. Furthermore, PCA allows for higher recognition rates while reducing features vector dimension.","['math', 'spi']"
Sensitivity analysis of catenary geometry on current collection quality,"A global sensitivity analysis is led on catenary parameters such as dropper lengths, height of the messenger wire at masts and mechanical tensions in the wires thanks to the Sobol indices. All parameters are defined using experimental measurements. A set of geometric and dynamic criteria is selected as output and the contribution of theinput parameters to the output variability is quantified. It is shown that the dynamicinteraction is mainly sensitive to the mechanical tensions in contact and messenger wires whereas existing geometric criteria are mainly dependent on height of messenger wire at masts. Moreover, selected geometric criteria available using geometry measurements are hardly correlated with dynamic criteria.",['spi']
Thin part identification for CAD model classification,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to focus on the characterization and classification of parts with respect to the meshing issue, and notably the meshing of thin parts difficulty handled automatically and which often requires adaptation steps. The objective is to distinguish the so-called thin parts and parts with thin features from the other parts. Design/methodology/approach – The concepts of thin part and part with thin features are introduced together with the mechanisms and criteria used for their identification in a CAD models database. The criteria are built on top of a set of shape descriptors and notably the distance distribution which is used to characterize the thickness of the object. To speed up the identification process, shape descriptors are computed from tessellated parts. Findings – A complete modular approach has been designed. It computes shape descriptors over parts stored in a directory and it uses criteria to distinguish three categories: thin parts, parts with thin features and other parts. Being the three categories identified, the user can spend more time on the parts that are considered as more difficulty meshable. Research limitations/implications – The approach is limited to the three above mentioned categories. However, it has been designed so that the values corresponding to the shape descriptors and associated meshing qualities can easily be inserted within a machining learning tool later on. Practical implications – The use of the developed tool can be seen as a pre-processing step during the preparation of finite element (FE) simulation models. It is automatic and can be run in batch and in parallel. Originality/value – The approach is modular, it is simple and easy to implement. Categories are built on top of several shape descriptors and not on a unique signature. It is independent of the CAD modeler. This approach is integrated within a FE simulation model preparation framework and help engineers anticipating difficulties when meshing CAD models.","['info', 'spi']"

Impact of geometric field of view on speed perception,"This paper deals with changes of the geometric field of view on speed perception. This study has been carried out using the SAAM dynamic driving simulator (Arts et Métiers ParisTech). SAAM provides motion cues thanks to a 6 DOF electromechanical platform and is equipped with a cylindrical screen of 150°. 20 subjects have reproduced 2 speeds (50 km/h and 90 km/h) without knowing the numerical values of these consigns, and with 5 different visual scale factors: 0.70, 0.85, 1.00, 1.15 and 1.30. This visual scale factor correspond to the ratio between the driver’s field of view covered by the screen (constant) and the geometric field of view. This study shows that this visual scale factor has a significant impact on the speed reached by the subjects and thus shows that perceived speed increases with this visual scale factor. A 0.15 modification of this factor is enough to obtain a significant effect. The modification of the geometric field of view remained unnoticed by all the subjects, which implies that this technique can be easily used to make drivers reduce their speed in driving simulation conditions. However, this technique may also modify perception of distances.Cet article présente l’effet du changement du champ de vision géométrique sur la perception de la vitesse. Cette étude a été réalisée sur le simulateur de conduite dynamique SAAM (Arts et Métiers ParisTech). SAAM utilise une plate-forme électromécanique à 6 DDL et est équipé d’un écran cylindrique de 150° pour restituer la sensation de mouvement. 20 sujets ont reproduit 2 vitesses (50 km/h et 90 km/h), sans connaître les valeurs de ces vitesses, et avec 5 facteurs d’échelle visuelle différents : 0.70, 0.85, 1.00, 1.15 et 1.30. Ces facteurs d’échelle correspondent aux rapports entre le champ de vision du conducteur couvert par l’image (constant) et le champ de vision géométrique. Cette étude montre que ce changement visuel a un impact significatif sur la vitesse qu’atteignent les sujets et montre donc que la vitesse perçue augmente avec ce facteur d’échelle visuelle. Un changement de 0.15 de ce facteur suffit pour obtenir un effet significatif. Les changements de champ de vision géométrique n’ont été détectés par aucun des sujets, ce qui implique que cette technique peut facilement être utilisée pour amener les conducteurs à réduire leur vitesse en conditions de simulation de conduite.

Lateral control assistance and driver behavior in emergency situations,"Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to help drivers improve driving safety. However, automation modifying the way drivers interact with their vehicle, it is important to avoid negative safety impacts. In particular, the change in drivers’ behavior introduced by ADAS in situations they are not designed for, should be carefully examined. We carried out an experiment on a driving simulator to study drivers’ reaction in an obstacle avoidance situation, when using a lateral control assistance system. A detailed analysis of the avoidance maneuver is presented. Results show that assisted and non-assisted drivers equally succeeded in avoiding the obstacle. However, further analyses tend to show an influence of the assistance system on drivers’ first reaction.",['info']
Bond Graph Modeling and Simulation of a Vibration Absorber System in Helicopters,"n the last 20 years, computer science has considerably progressed and there has been a resurgence of interest in bond graphs. The evolution of bond graph software has allowed for the full exploitation of its graphical aspects and for its simulation directly from the modeling environment without the need for the modeler to derive the associated dynamic equations. However, within this last decade, few simulations of complex multibody systems modeled with bond graphs have been conducted directly from a graphic software platform. In this context, the objective of this chapter is to show how bond graphs can be used to model and simulate a complex mechatronic system with bond graph simulation software. The multibody system studied in this chapter is a helicopter’s vibration absorber suspension. The structural and modular approach allowed by bond graphs permits a systematic modeling of mechatronic multibody systems. The model is then built as an assembly of components or modules (rigid bodies and compliant kinematic joints) by following the structure of the actual system. This approach was carried out with the use of the parasitic elements method. The bond graph model of the suspension has been verified with another multibody tool for three different excitations (pumping, roll, and yaw). The first part of this chapter will be dedicated to giving the reader an overview of the modeling of multibody systems with bond graphs. BG models of the rigid body and all the basic kinematic joints will be presented. The main existing methods (zero-causal paths ZCPs, Lagrange multipliers, and singular perturbation) for modeling and carrying out simulations of multibody systems will be recalled. The second part of this chapter will present a vector bond graph (also called multibond graph) model of a helicopter’s antivibratory system and the associated simulations. This system is a specific suspension of a helicopter, which filters the vibration coming from the rotor to the fuselage. It is a complex multibody system with four closed kinematic chains (CKC). The dynamic equations of such a CKC system are differential-algebraic equation systems (DAE) that are often difficult to treat and which require specific solving methods. The intention of writing this chapter was to give to bond graph practitioners a detailed and comprehensive method so as to model and conduct simulations of complex multibody systems directly from a bond graph modeling interface.",['spi']
Simplified numerical model for the laser metal deposition additive manufacturing process,"The laser metal deposition (LMD) laser technique is a free-form metal deposition process, which allows generating near net-shape structures through the interaction of a powder stream and a laser beam. A simplified numerical model was carried out to predict layer heights together with temperature distributions induced by the (LMD) process on a titanium alloy, and a metal matrix composite. Compared with previously developed models, this simplified approach uses an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian free surface motion directly dependent on the powder mass feed rate Dm. Considering thin wall builds of Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy, numerical results obtained with comsol 4.3 Multiphysics software were successfully compared with the experimental data such as geometrical properties of manufactured walls, fast camera molten pools measurements, and thermocouple temperature recordings in the substrate during the manufacturing of up to 10 LMD. Even if the model did not consider coupled hydraulic-thermal aspects, it provides a more realistic local geometrical description of additive layer manufacturing walls than simpler thermal models, with much shorter calculation times than more sophisticated approaches considering thermocapillary fluid flow. In a second step, microstructures (equiaxed or columnar) were predicted on Ti-6Al-4V walls using microstructural map available in the literature, and local thermal gradients G (K/m) and solidification rate R (m/s) provided by the FE calculation near the solidification front. © 2017 Laser Institute of America.",['spi']
Towards a priori mesh quality estimation using Machine Learning Techniques,"Since the quality of FE meshes strongly affects the quality of the FE simulations, it is known to be very important to generate good quality meshes. Thus, it is crucial to be able to estimate very early what can be the expected quality of a mesh without having to play in loop with several control parameters. This paper addresses the way the quality of FE meshes can be estimated a priori, i.e. before meshing the CAD models. In this way, designers can generate good quality meshes at first glance. Our approach is based on the use of a set of rules which allow estimating what will be the mesh quality according to the shape characteristics of the CAD model to be meshed. Those rules are built using Machine Learning Techniques, notably classification ones, which analyse a huge amount of configurations for which the shape characteristics of both the CAD models and meshes are known. For an unknown configuration, i.e. for a CAD model not yet meshed, the learnt rules help understanding what can be the expected classes of quality, or in another way what are the control parameters to be set up to reach a given mesh quality. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested on academic and industrial examples.","['info', 'spi']"
Effective properties of dissipative composites under fully coupled thermomechanical processes,"The current work deals with periodic composite media undergoing fully coupled thermomechanical loading. In these composites the material constituents are considered to obey the generalized standard materials laws. The aim of this research is to provide a proper homogenization framework that describes accurately all set of equations in both microscopic and macroscopic levels. The main tool of the study is the asymptotic expansion homogenization technique, which permits to deduce useful results about the energy potentials and constitutive laws that characterize the material response in both scales. In order to overcome the difficulty that the internal dissipation in the macroscale cannot be split analytically in terms of thermodynamic forces and fluxes, an incremental, linearized formulation is proposed. This formulation allows to identify proper thermomechanical tangent moduli for the macroscale problem and thus design an implicit computational scheme. The capability of this framework is illustrated with a numerical example on multilayered composites undergoing viscoplastic mechanisms.",['spi']
Reducing reversal errors in localizing the source of sound in virtual environment without head tracking,"This paper presents a study about the effect of using additional audio cueing and Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) on human performance in sound source localization task without using head movement. The existing techniques of sound spatialization generate reversal errors. We intend to reduce these errors by introducing sensory cues based on sound effects. We conducted and experimental study to evaluate the impact of additional cues in sound source localization task. The results showed the benefit of combining the additional cues and HRTF in terms of the localization accuracy and the reduction of reversal errors. This technique allows significant reduction of reversal errors compared to the use of the HRTF separately. For instance, this technique could be used to improve audio spatial alerting, spatial tracking and target detection in simulation applications when head movement is not included.",['info']
Hardness Evaluation of Porous Hydroxyapatite Coating,"The extensive use of appropriate coatings to improve wear resistance, friction coefficient, electrical properties, corrosion resistance and biomedical application has stimulated a growing interest in their mechanical properties and especially hardness testing that is routinely used for coating evaluation. In this study Jönsson and Hogmark model is applied for the porous hydroxyapatite produced by plasma spraying on Ti6A14V substrate. Firstly, the effect of indentation load on hardness values of coating and substrate are studied. The modified Jönsson and Hogmark model is used to explain the composite hardness behavior and the effect of coating porosity.","['sdv', 'spi']"
CAD assembly descriptors for knowledge capitalization and model retrieval,"Today, there exists a huge amount of digital data easily downloadable from Internet and/or simply accessible from large databases. Despite this rise, the methods to retrieve and search for specific data have not been sufficiently studied and developed, notably when considering 3D contents. Thus, it is sometime more efficient to define new 3D shapes starting from scratch rather than to try to make use of existing ones hardly identifiable within those databases. This is particularly true when considering CAD assembly models often resulting from a long and time-consuming modeling phase within the Product Development Process. Thus, having new methods, models and tools to capitalize, retrieve and reuse CAD assembly models would help saving a lot of time. This paper addresses such a difficult problem of finding a method to characterize and structure CAD assemblies so as to be able to search for similar ones. A framework has been designed for the retrieval of globally and/or partially similar assembly mod- els according to different user-specified search criteria. It is based on an assembly descriptor, called the Enriched Assembly Model (EAM), which encodes all the required data automatically extracted from the geometry and structure of the CAD models. The data are organized in several layers thus enabling multi-level structuring and queries. It also allows fuzzy queries, which can be further refined.","['info', 'spi']"

Natural Language Processing of Requirements for Model-Based Product Design with ENOVIA/CATIA V6,"The enterprise level software application that supports the strategic product-centric, lifecycle-oriented and information-driven Product Lifecycle Management business approach should enable engineers to develop and manage requirements within a Functional Digital Mock-Up. The integrated, model-based product design ENOVIA/CATIA V6 RFLP environment makes it possible to use parametric modelling among requirements, functions, logical units and organs. Simulation can therefore be used to verify that the design artefacts comply with the requirements. Nevertheless, when dealing with document-based specifications, the definition of the knowledge parameters for each requirement is a labour-intensive task. Indeed, analysts have no other alternative than to go through the voluminous specifications to identify the values of the performance requirements and design constraints, and to translate them into knowledge parameters. We propose to use natural language processing techniques to automatically generate Parametric Property-Based Requirements from unstructured and semi-structured specifications. We illustrate our approach through the design of a mechanical ring.",['info']
Numerical and Experimental Analysis of Cold Stretching of Aluminum Sheets Using an Instrumented Bench,"Cold stretching of a thin 5154 aluminium sheet is studied. An instrumented bench is developed to analyse the forming of double curvature panels.

The bench is calibrated by comparing experiments and numerical results in terms of deformed shape, in-plane strain levels and thickness evolution.",['spi']
Effect of supply conditions of liquid nitrogen on the cryogenic assisted machining of the Ti64 Titanium alloy,"This study focuses on the optimization of the machining assisted by cryogenic cooling. The main objective is to analyze the effect of the pressure and the flow of liquid nitrogen on tool life when machining titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V using the cryogenic assisted machining. A nozzle holder has been specially developed for this study to ensure positioning and the replacement of calibrated nozzles of different diameters. Several nozzle diameters have been therefore used in order to vary the pressure and the flow according to tests to be conducted. The flow rate has been varied between 1.2 l/min and 3.4 l/min for two pressure ranges 8-10 bar and 4-5 bar respectively.The machining tests have allowed to highlight the effect of the pressure and flow rate of liquid nitrogen jet on the tool life. Indeed, the results showed that increasing the flow rate increases the tool life. In addition, the increase in pressureslowed down the evolution of the wear and further improves the tool life.Indeed, in all tested cases, the cryogenic assistance improves the tool life but the best results have been obtained for the highest pressure and flow rate. Moreover, surface integrity has been greatly improved",['spi']
New VR Navigation Techniques to Reduce Cybersickness,"In nowadays state of the art VR environments, displayed in CAVEs or HMDs, navigation technics may frequently induce cybersickness or VR-Induced Symptoms and Effects (VRISE), drastically limiting the friendly use of VR environments with no navigation limitations. In two distinct experiments, we investigated acceleration VRISE thresholds for longitudinal and rotational motions and compared 3 different VR systems: 2 CAVEs and a HMD (Oculus Rift DK2). We found that VRISE occur more often and more strongly in case of rotational motions and found no major difference between the CAVEs and the HMD. Based on the obtained thresholds we developed a new ""Head Lock"" navigation method for rotational motions in a virtual environment in order to generate a “Pseudo AR” mode, keeping fixed visual outside world references. Thanks to a third experiment we have shown that this new metaphor significantly reduces VRISE occurrences and may be a useful base for future natural navigation technics.",['info']
Aesthetic-oriented classification of 2D free-form curves,"Nowadays, it is commonly admitted that the aesthetic appearance of a product has an enhanced role in its commercial success. Therefore, understanding and manipulating the aesthetic properties of shapes in the early design phases has become a very important field of research. There exists an appropriate vocabulary for describing the aesthetic properties of 2D free-form curves that includes terms such as straightness, acceleration, convexity and tension, which are normally used by stylists when describing and modifying shapes. However, the relationships between this vocabulary and the geometric models are not well established. This work investigates the possibility of applying Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) to discover possible classification patterns of 2D free-form curves with respect to the so-called straightness of the curve. First, we verified that MLT can correctly (99.78%) reapply the classification to new curves. In addition, we verified the abilities of the Attribute Selection methods to identify the most important attributes for the considered classification, among a larger set of attributes. As a result, it was possible to recognize as the most characterizing parameters the same curve attributes previously used to compute the measure of straightness (S). Moreover, Linear Regression (LR) was able to extract automatically an exact mathematical model, which can correlate the geometric quantities with the class of the curve, congruent to one we previously specified. This work indeed demonstrates that MLT are very suitable and can be efficiently used in this context. The work is a first step towards the characterization and classification of free form surfaces giving the general directions on how MLT can be exploited to characterize free-form surfaces with respects to the aesthetic properties.","['info', 'spi']"
Vibration Analysis of Euler-Bernoulli Beams Partially Immersed in a Viscous Fluid,"The vibrational characteristics of a microbeam are well known to strongly depend on the fluid in which the beam is immersed. In this paper, we present a detailed theoretical study of the modal analysis of microbeams partially immersed in a viscous fluid. A fixed-free microbeamvibrating in a viscous fluid is modeled using the Euler-Bernoulli equation for the beams.The unsteady Stokes equations are solved using a Helmholtz decomposition technique in a two-dimensional plane containing the microbeams cross sections.The symbolic softwareMathematica is used in order to find the coupled vibration frequencies of beams with two portions. The frequency equation is deduced and analytically solved.The finite element method using ComsolMultiphysics software results is compared with present method for validation and an acceptable match between them was obtained. In the eigenanalysis, the frequency equation is generated by satisfying all boundary conditions. It is shown that the present formulation is an appropriate and new approach to tackle the problem with good accuracy.",['spi']
Contribution of statistical methods to the study of worn paint coatings surface topography,"A surface morphology can be described by numerous roughness parameters. Making the most of the power of modern computers, the relative relevance of a hundred surface roughness parameters is assessed in this investigation with regard to the relationships between the morphological texture, the low wear damage and the gloss of polymer coatings. The relevance of each roughness parameter is quantitatively determined by statistical indexes of performance defined and calculated by combining the two-way ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) and the Computer Based Bootstrap Method (CBBM). The fractal dimension is shown to be the most relevant parameter for characterising the different morphological textures of studied coatings and the average curvature radius of peaks for characterising the effect of wear. A linear relationship is found between the reduction of gloss and the reduction of the average curvature radius of peaks due to wear. Besides, it is also shown that angles of 85° and 20° are the most relevant for characterising, respectively, the effects of the morphological texture of polymer coatings and wear on the gloss measurements.",['spi']
Colloidal Particle Deposition in Porous Media Under Flow: A Numerical Approach,The objective of this study is to simulate the transport and deposition of colloidal particles at the pore scale by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations (CFD). This consists in the three-dimensional numerical modeling of the process of transport and deposition of colloidal particles in a porous medium idealized as a bundle of capillaries of circular cross section. The velocity field obtained by solving the Stokes and continuity equations is superimposed to particles diffusion and particles are let to adsorb when they closely approach the solid wall. Once a particle is adsorbed the flow velocity field is updated before a new particle is injected. Our results show that both adsorption probability and surface coverage are decreasing functions of the particle’s Péclet number. At low Péclet number values when diffusion is dominant the surface coverage is shown to approach the Random Sequential Adsorption value while it drops noticeably for high Péclet number values. Obtained data were also used to calculate the loss of porosity and permeability.,['spi']
Critical Plane Concept and Energy Approach in Multiaxial Fatigue,"This paper aims to propose a new interpretation of several energy based critical plane high cycle fatigue criteria. More exactly, the meaning of several global energy based criteria is detailed from the calculation of normal and shear work on a critical plane. This study is limited to multiaxial fatigue under constant amplitude and synchronous loadings (proportional or non-proportional), with or without mean load. After a short review of some energy based criteria using the critical plane concept or a global approach, the reasons why energy based critical plane criteria are more and more developed in literature are summarized. It is shown that a direct link exists between critical plane energy parameters and global ones. A critical examination of the famous Findley et al. experiments is proposed and the previous link is illustrated with two mesoscopic criteria developed by Papadopoulos and the global energy based criterion of Banvillet et al. This leads to propose an interpretation of fatigue crack initiation from the mesoscopic scale up to the macroscopic scale either with stress and strain quantities or with strain energy parameters.",['spi']
Framework definition for the design of a mobile manufacturing system,"Abstract The concept of mobile manufacturing systems is presented in the literature as an enabler for improving company competitiveness by cost reduction, delay respect and quality control. In comparison with classical sedentary systems, added characteristics should be taken into consideration, such as the system life phases, the dependency to the production location, human qualification as well as means supply constraints. Such considerations might be addressed as soon as possible in the design process. This paper aims at presenting a contribution for the design of mobile manufacturing systems based on three analysis: (1) an analysis of the mobile manufacturing system features (2) an identification of the attributes enabling the system mobility assessment, and (3) the proposal of a framework for mobile production system design considering new context­specific decision criteria.",['spi']
Micro and macroscopic characterization of A-SMC under high speed tensile test,"Advanced Sheet Molding Compound (A-SMC) is a serious composite material candidate for structural automotive parts. It has a thermoset matrix and consists of high weight content of glass fibers (50% in mass) compared to standard SMC with less than 30% weight fiber content. During crash events, structural parts are heavily exposed to high rates of loading and straining. This work is concerned with the development of an advanced experimental approach devoted to the micro and macroscopic characterization of A-SMC mechanical behavior under high-speed tension. High speed tensile test are achieved using servo-hydraulic test equipment in order to get required high strain rates up to 100 s -1 . Local deformation is measured through a contactless technique using a high speed camera. Numerical computations have led to an optimal design of the specimen geometry and the experimental damping systems have been optimised in terms of thickness and material properties. These simulations were achieved using ABAQUS explicit finite element code. The developed experimental methodology is applied for two types of A-SMC: Randomly Oriented fibers (RO) and Highly Oriented fibers (HO) plates. In the case of HO samples, two tensile directions were chosen: HO-0° (parallel to the Mold Flow Direction (MFD)) and HO-90° (perpendicular to the MFD). High speed tensile tests results show that A-SMC behavior is strain-rate dependent although the young’s modulus remains constant with increasing strain rate. In the case of HO-0°, the stress damage threshold is shown an increase of 63%, when the strain rate varies from quasi-static (0.001 s -1 ) to 100 s -1 .",['spi']
Medical Imaging : Exams Planning and Resource Assignment : Hybridization of a Metaheuristic and a List Algorithm,"The presented work is about optimization of the hospital system. An existing solution is the pooling of resources within the same territory. This may involve different forms of cooperation between several hospitals. Problems of sizing, planning and scheduling may be considered. We define the problem of activities planning with resource assignment. To solve this problem, we propose a hybridization between a metaheuristic and a list algorithm. Single based metaheuristics are used. This proposition requires a new encoding inspired by permutation problems. This method is easy to apply: it combines already known methods. With the proposed hybridization, the constraints to be considered only need to be integrated into the list algorithm. For big instances, the solver used as a reference returns only lower and upper bounds. The results of our method are very promising. It is possible to adapt our method on more complex issues through integration into the list algorithm of the constraints. It would be particularly interesting to test these methods on real hospital authorities to assess their significance.",['info']
A continuous crystallographic approach to generate cubic lattices and its effect on relative stiffness of architectured materials,"This original work proposes to investigate the transposition of crystallography rules to cubic lattice architectured materials to generate new 3D porous structures. The application of symmetry operations provides a complete and convenient way to configure the lattice architecture with only two parameters. New lattice structures were created by slipping from the conventional Bravais lattice toward non-compact complex structures. The resulting stiffness of the porous materials was thoroughly evaluated for all the combinations of architecture parameters. This exhaustive study revealed attractive structures having high specific stiffness, up to twice as large as the usual octet-truss for a given relative density. It results in a relationship between effective Young modulus and relative density for any lattice structure. It also revealed the opportunity to generate auxetic structures at will, with a controlled Poisson ratio. The collection of the elastic properties for all the cubic structures into 3D maps provides a convenient tool for lattice materials design, for research, and for mechanical engineering. The resulting mechanical properties are highly variable according to architecture, and can be easily tailored for specific applications using the simple yet powerful formalism developed in this work.",['spi']
Design for safety: proposition of a model to detect hazards through energy flows analysis,"The European directive 2006/42/CE promulgates the machine safe design principles to prevent professional risks. However, outside machines that have specific safety standards, the designers of special machines and manufacturing systems can only use generic safety standards, limiting as a consequence the results of hazards detection. The aim of this paper is to present an original approach for this detection during the design of working equipment. We based our study on a hypothesis of the literature that links hazards to the presence of energy flows. Thus, the hazards detection is reduced to the study of the building of energy flows and the detection of potential links between these flows and the operator. Thanks to such data, the designer will be able to select the best risk prevention solutions. To reach this goal, we decided to use the Functional Energetic Model (FEMo) to model the technical system and its energy flows. This choice was made because this model was developed for the design of technical systems integrating different types of energy. By using this modelling, the designer can easily analyses every potential interactions between the energy flows and the operator, depending on the future working situations in each life cycle phases. Our approach builds on this model all along the design process, allowing the designer to early detect hazards and to apply at the best moment the risk prevention solutions. We present the application of this approach during the design of a working equipment, since the definition of the raw need. We confirm that its application and the system modelling in the EFM formalism are possible since the conceptual design phase. Data from the next design phases enrich the model, and consequently improve the detection and characterization of hazards.",['spi']
Method of hole shrinkage radial forces measurement in Ti6 Al4V drilling,"This work deals with the phenomenon of hole shrinkage during Ti6Al4V drilling. Indeed, the shape and dimensions of the drilled hole, as well as the heat generated by the operation depend on this phenomenon which is caused by multiple factors, including the relaxation of internal residual stresses, thermal expansion and diverse thermome chanical loads applied to the workpiece and the tool. Nevertheless, the present study focuses only on the mechanical aspect and especially aims atshowing the development of an innovative method to measure the radial forces induced by the hole shrinkage phenomenon.",['spi']
Augmented reality as an aid for the use of machine tools,"This article presents a work in progress of using augmented reality as a way to help handling computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools. Several reasons justify the use of augmented reality in machine tools: (i) a high complexity of using such machines, especially for beginners; (ii) low ergonomics since the operator has to move continuously between the machine window and a control screen to ensure smooth operations; (iii) the window is often obstructed by the lubricant, therefore the operator must often rely only on information displayed by the control screen; (iv) a non-user-friendly interface of the machine; and (v) a complex maintenance operation. In this work, a prototype of a system allowing an operator to improve its working conditions and better handle CNC machines using ar devices is proposed. These devices are positioned in front of the machine, connect to it and display real-time information, such as the operating conditions and a 3D representation of the cutting tool motion. A user interface was also designed to manage operators’ profiles with customized information. The system was tested by several users who confirmed its potentialities to assist machine operators in their work. Other possibilities of this system are under investigation, such as a training tool for beginners and a guide for machine maintenance.",['info']
Reusing heterogeneous data for the conceptual design of shapes in virtual environments,"Today, digital data such as 2D images, 3D meshes and 3D point clouds are widely used to design virtual environments (VE). Most of the time, only one type of those multimodal data is used to describe and specify the shapes of the objects. However, a single object can be seen as a combination of components linked with constraints specifying the relationships and the rigid transformations defining their arrangement. Thus, the definition of new methods able to combine any kind of multimodal data in an easy way would allow non-experts of VE to rapidly mock up objects and scenes. In this paper, we propose a new shape description model together with its associated constraints toolbox enabling the description of complex shapes from multimodal data. Not only rigid transformations are considered but also scale modifications according to the specified context of the constraint setting. The heterogeneous virtual objects (i.e., composed by scalable multimodal components) then result from the resolution of a constraint satisfaction problem through an optimization approach. The proposed approach is illustrated and validated with examples obtained using our prototype software.",['info']

"Fully coupled thermomechanical model for shape memory alloys accounting for phase transformation, martensitic reorientation, transformation-induced plasticity and fatigue damage","The present work proposes a 3D model, based on the thermodynamical coupling of different strain mechanisms such as the forward and reverse phase transformation, the martensitic reorientation, the transformation-introduced plasticity and the fatigue damage. To achieve this goal, all the above mentioned mechanisms are described through the martensitic volume fraction as the coupling parameter. A recently developed, thermomechanically coupled, SMA constitutive law, including both the phase transformation and martensitic reorientation mechanisms, has been validated under non-proportional loading conditions through a series of comparisons between numerical and experimental results. This model is extended further in order to capture the accumulated TRIP residual strain induced by the martensitic transformation, accounting in addition for the accumulated fatigue damage, which evolves during the cyclic loading. The fatigue damage is incorporated into the constitutive law through the concepts of continuum damage theory. Numerical investigation under strongly non-proportional thermomechanical loading conditions demonstrate the capabilities of the new framework.",['spi']
A comparison between different methods for the numerical simulation of polycrystalline aggregates,"The macroscopic behavior of polycrystalline materials is largely influenced by the shape, the arrangement and the orientation of crystallites. Different methods have thus been developed to determine the effective behavior of such materials as a function of their microstructural features. In this work, which focuses on polycrystalline materials with an elastic-viscoplastic behavior, the self-consistent (SC) method [1], the finite element (FE) method and the spectral (FFT) method [2] are compared. These common methods are used to determine the effective behavior of different 316L polycrystalline aggregates subjected to various loading conditions (uniaxial tension, cyclic tension/compression).(...)",['spi']
Statistical artefacts in the determination of the fractal dimension by the slit island method,"This paper comments upon some statistical aspects of the slit island method which is widely used to calculate the fractal dimension of fractured surfaces or of materials’ features like grain geometry. If a noise is introduced when measuring areas and perimeters of the islands (experimental errors), it is shown that errors are made in the calculation of the fractal dimension and more than a false analytical relation between a physical process parameter and the fractal dimension can be found. Moreover, positive or negative correlation with the same physical process parameter can be obtained whether the regression is performed by plotting the variation of the noisy area versus the noisy perimeter of the considered islands or vice versa. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the analytical relations obtained under statistical considerations.","['math', 'spi', 'phys']"

The experimental measures of the characteristic curves and of the wall static pressure fluctuations signals upstream and downstream the pump and the exchanger were compared to the numerical results.

ON THE FORMULATION OF A TENSORIAL LAMINATE-LEVEL FAILURE CRITERION THROUGH INVARIANTS,"Anisotropic materials, such as fibre-reinforced composite materials, are extensively used in many industrial fields thanks to their mechanical performances. The main characteristic of an anisotropic material is the dependency of physical properties upon the direction. Anisotropy influences strongly also the mechanical strength of a material, usually described by a failure criterion. We can separate the failure criteria into two distinct classes: the phenomenological/polynomial ones and the physically-based ones. The polynomial failure criteria are called in this way because the occurrence of the failure is checked through the computation of a scalar indicator, i.e. the failure index. In this framework, a unique scalar condition has to be verified, regardless the nature of the failure mechanism that is activated. It is noteworthy that all polynomial failure criteria are “ply-level failure criteria"", thus, when utilised to analyse the failure of laminated structures, they are applied to each ply composing the structure in order to check the so-called first-ply-failure. However, this approach is not compatible with the methodologies often used for the preliminary design of composite structures. Indeed in this background, the number of design variables is economised by representing each laminate (composing the structure) as an equivalent homogeneous anisotropic plate characterised by a few number of parameters describing its overall mechanical response regardless to the nature of the stacking sequence. In order to include the failure mechanisms within the mathematical framework of preliminary design of composite structure an alternative approach is needed. To this purpose, a method to generalise the ply-level failure criterion of Tsai-Wu to the laminate-level (with the aim of introducing strength requirements at the macroscopic scale within the optimisation process of a composite structures) is proposed in this work.The Tsai-Wu criterion is formulated in the framework of the First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) in order to take into account the out-of-plane shear stress and strain components. Then, through the use of the polar method, the criterion is firstly formulated in terms of invariants. Finally it is extended, via a through-the-thickness homogenisation step, to the laminate-level in order to evaluate the strength of the entire laminate. The laminate-level failure criterion is thus expressed for a laminated plate modelled as an equivalent single layer having the same thickness of the laminate. Thanks to the polar representation a physical meaning of each tensor appearing in the laminate-level criterion is also given. The resulting criterion is then used in the framework of a strength optimisation problem in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The multi-scale two-level optimisation strategy is used to firstly optimise the polar parameters of the tensors of the laminate-level criterion (macro-scale optimisation step) and then the lay-up design is carried out to find at least one stacking sequence satisfying the strength polar parameters provided by the first-step of the strategy (meso-scale optimisation step)",['spi']
Development of a precision machine to perform and study orthogonal micro-cutting,"This article presents a laboratory machine designed to perform orthogonal micro-cutting experiments. The machine allows an accurate control of the various cutting parameters and a direct comparison of micro- and macrocutting tool-material data bases. Research with the machine will focus on validating the application of macrocutting data to at least a range of microcutting applications and to define the limits beyond which such applications are no longer possible. The paper describes the machine and its design specifications and provides the validation of the performances claimed. The machine can cut in a reproducible manner with depths of cut as low as 1 micronm, at speeds in the range 50 to 1000 mm/s while measuring the cutting and thrust forces. The variability in nominal depth of cut is equal or better than 1 micronm. Application examples illustrate the influence of lubrication and lead additions on the cutting process and demonstrate that the machine is indeed suitable for the application for which it was designed.",['spi']
LCA of recycling chains: influence of transport modelling,"Transport is an inherent activity of recycling chains. In LCA studies of e-waste recycling, the transport during the end-of-life management is either not considered or the distances are estimated and are not in accordance with reality. When transport is comprised in LCA boundaries, depending to the type of product then material, there is no consensus of its influence on the results. Some authors stressed that logistic chain accounts for a significant amount of impacts, but there are studies that concluded that the impacts are negligible in comparison to treatment activities. In this context, the goal of the study was to identify the contribution of transport (varying both distance and loading rate) in LCA results of e-waste recycling. A tablet treated in France was used as a case study. Life cycle inventory is based on the inventories available in Ecoinvent database and adapted with literature and primary data. In order to assess, spatialize and quantify the distances between the different stakeholders of the recycling chain, transport inventory was performed with a geographic information system (GIS) and LCA coupling approach. Impact assessment results were calculated at midpoint level with several impact categories. Depending on the impact category, transport contributes between 10 to 30% of the total impacts related to end-of-life treatment. This result stresses the need for assessing more realist scenarios for e-waste treatment.",['sde']
Eco-driving performance assessment with in-car visual and haptic feedback assistance,"In this experiment, 28 participants completed an urban driving task in the CARDS simulator at Renault’s Technical Centre for Simulation. This simulator, based on the SCANeR2© software package, provides a 150° field of view in a fully instrumented cockpit. Two different eco-driving assistance devices were added: a 7 inches display on the mid-console, and a force feedback system on the gas pedal. The feedback information was computed by comparing the car’s instant acceleration with an optimal acceleration level based on a proprietary consumption model of a Renault diesel engine. Basic eco-driving behaviors, like gear-shifting under 2000 Rpm, allows significant decrease of polluting emissions. Assisting drivers with visual, haptic, or visual-haptic on-board devices, in addition to low engine speed verbal instructions, lead to supplementary significant savings of polluting emissions. There is no significant difference between assistance feedback type; suggesting that haptic feedback provides the same ecoperformance as visual feedback. In particular, subjects show good adaptation to the haptic feedback pedal at first utilization of the system. They apparently relied more on haptic modality to achieve the eco-driving task, when they used both visual and haptic assistance.Dans cette expérimentation, 28 participants accomplissent une tâche de conduite dans le simulateur CARDS du Centre Technique de Simulation de Renault. Ce simulateur, équipé du logiciel de simulation SCANeR2©, délivre un angle de vue de 150° dans un cockpit entièrement in strumenté. Deux interfaces d’assistance à l’éco-conduite complètent le dispositif expérimental : un écran de 7 pouces sur la console centrale et un dispositif appliquant un retour d’effort à la pédale d’accélérateur. Le retour d’information est calculé en comparant l’accélération instantanée du véhicule à un niveau d’accélération optimal, d’après un modèle de consommation de moteur diesel Renault. La pratique de l’éco-conduite, comme le changement de rapport sous les 2000 Rpm, permet de réduire significativement les émissions polluantes. L’assistance des conducteurs avec des systèmes d’aide visuel, haptique ou visuo-haptique, permet une réduction supplémentaire significative des émissions polluantes. Aucune différence significative n’a été constatée entre les différents modes d’assistance ; ce qui laisse penser que l’assistance haptique engendre la même écoperformance que l’assistance visuelle. En particulier, les sujets font preuve d’une adaptation satisfaisante à la pédale haptique lors d’une première utilisation du système. Ils accordent apparemment plus de confiance à la modalité haptique pour accomplir leur tâche d’éco-conduite en présence d’une assistance visuohaptique.",['info']
Multiscale modeling of periodic dissipative composites under thermomechanical loading conditions,"The modern technological challenges on the engineering industry and the extensive advances in the materials science have caused a tremendous increase in the development of composites. Plenty of engineering and biomechanics applications demand smart materials and structures which combine high strength, multifunctionality and durability. At the same time, a crucial parameter in the choice of the most suitable composite material is the long lifetime during repeated loading cycles, thus fatigue is an essential parameter in design. To achieve the high demands in the modern applications, composite materials often operate under thermomechanical conditions that cause the appearance of dissipative phenomena like plasticity, viscoelasticity-viscoplasticity and damage. The present work deals with periodic composite media subjected to fully coupled thermomechanical loading. The material constituents of these composites are assumed to belong in the general class of generalized standard materials laws. The aim is to provide a proper homogenization framework that describes accurately the basic conservation laws in both microscopic and macroscopic levels. The study is based on the asymptotic expansion homogenization technique, which permits to deduce useful results about the energy potentials that characterize the material response in both scales. Moreover, the numerical implementation is based on an incremental, linearized formulation. This formulation allows to identify proper thermomechanical 3D tangent moduli for the macroscale problem and thus design an implicit computational scheme.",['spi']
Damage indexes comparison for the structural health monitoring of a stiffened composite plate,"Stiffened composite structures are very appealing in aeronautic applications due to their unique stiffness to mass ratio. However, they are also prone to various and complex damage scenario (stiffener debonding, impact damage...) and to complex wave propagation phenomena due to the presence of the stiffener. Consequently, autonomous monitoring of such structure is still a real issue. The process of monitoring in real-time a structure is referred to structural health monitoring (SHM) and consists of several steps: damage detection, localization, classification, and quantification. The focus is put here on the damage detection step of SHM. To detect damages, stiffened composite structures are equipped with piezoelectric elements that act both as sensors and actuators. A database at the unknown (and possibly damaged state) is then compared to a healthy reference database. Several damage indexes (DIs) designed for detection are extracted from this comparison. The SHM process classically relies on four sequential steps: damage detection, localization, classification, and quantification. The most critical step of such process is the damage detection step since it is the first one and because performances of the following steps depend on it. A common method to design such a detector consists in relying on a statistical characterization of the damage indexes available in the healthy behavior of the structure. On the basis of this information, a decision threshold can then be computed in order to achieve a desired probability of false alarm (PFA). In this paper, the performances of these DIs with respect to damage detection in a stiffened composite plate are studied. Results show that DIs based on energy consideration perform better than the ones based on cross-correlation. Furthermore Fourier-transform based DIs appear to be insensitive to the presence of damage in such structure.",['spi']
Navigation in virtual environments: Design and comparison of two anklet vibration patterns for guidance,"In this study, we present a preliminary exploration about the added value of vibration information for guiding navigation in a VE. The exploration consists of two parts. Firstly, we designed two different vibration patterns. These patterns, pushing pattern and compass pattern, differ conceptually in the levels of abstraction. Secondly, we undertook an experiment to compare the two patterns in guiding navigation in a VE. The objective of the comparison is to establish a baseline for examining the suitability of using vibration patterns to guide navigation.",['info']
Head Motion parallax effect on driving performances when using an AR-HUD: Simulation Study on Renault’s CARDs Simulator,"Augmented Reality information on Head-Up display (AR-HUD) in a car can be relevant for visual aid and for strengthening the safety of the driver. However, some display Parameters are necessary to guarantee the good perception of these information and the driving environment. In this study, we are interested on head motion parallax, and specifically the ones generated with lateral head movements of the driver. In fact, during natural observation this cue physiologically strengthens depth perception and its absence may impact driver perception. Our goal is to demonstrate the impact of the generated movements and the projection distance on driver’s perception, using an AR-HUD. This was investigated in terms of eye-comfort and driver preferences. In this article, we focus on the primary driving task with basic lane marking highlight, and we observe how the different conditions affect subject’s perception especially during curves negotiation. Results show the importance of eye-tracking when using an AR-HUD for alignment accuracy and better comfort which directly driver performance and safety.",['info']
Review of data mining applications for quality assessment in manufacturing industry: Support Vector Machines,"In many modern manufacturing industries, data that characterize the manufacturing process are electronically collected and stored in the databases. Due to advances in data collection systems and analysis tools, data mining (DM) has widely been applied for quality assessment (QA) in manufacturing industries. In DM, the choice of technique to use in analyzing a dataset and assessing the quality depend on the understanding of the analyst. On the other hand, with the advent of improved and efficient prediction techniques, there is a need for an analyst to know which tool performs best for a particular type of data set. Although a few review papers have recently been published to discuss DM applications in manufacturing for QA, this paper provides an extensive review to investigate the application of a special DM technique, namely support vector machine (SVM) to solve QA problems. The review provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature from various points of view as DM preliminaries, data preprocessing, DM applications for each quality task, SVM preliminaries, and application results. Summary tables and figures are also provided besides to the analyses. Finally, conclusions and future research directions are provided.",['spi']
Determination of the characteristic parameters of tension-compression asymmetry of Shape Memory Alloys using full-field measurements,"In this work, a method for the identification of the transformation surface of Shape Memory Alloys based on full field measurements is presented.

The constitutive equations of the chosen model that capture the macroscopic behavior of Shape Memory Alloys are first presented. The material parameters, to be identified, that are characteristic of the tension-compression asymmetry of the alloy are detailed.

Laser welding of Cu-Al-Be shape memory alloys: Microstructure and mechanical properties,"Cu-based shape memory alloys are potential substitutes of NiTi shape memory alloys, owing to their lower production costs and recent increase inmechanical properties arising frombetter control of the microstructure.

In thiswork, laserwelding of single crystal-like Cu-Al-Be shapememory alloys was performed. The microstructure and tensile propertieswere evaluated to understand the effect of laserwelding on the microstructural and mechanical features of thewelded joints. Cycling tests performed for awide range of temperatures revealed that the joints possess extraordinary superelastic recovery after joining, with potential applications in damping devices due to the significant amount of energy that can be absorbed during superelastic deformation.",['spi']
CFD simulation and optimize of LN2 flow inside channels used for cryogenic machining: application to milling of titanium alloy Ti - 6Al - 4V,"Cryogenic machining is seen as a possible solution to increase tool life and improve surface integrity of machined components, by efficiently removing the heat from the cutting zone. Unfortunately, most of the publications on this topic does not investigate properly the physical phenomena occurring inside the pipe connecting the tankto the cutting tools/nozzle. These phenomena will affect the cryogenic flow characteristics at nozzle outlet, thus the performance of the cryogenic machining. In this work, a CFD model is developed and applied to investigate the liquid nitrogen (LN2) flow inside the pipe connecting the reservoir to the cutting tool/nozzle. The results show that the effectiveness of the cooling process depends not only on the input flow parameters (pressure, velocity, temperature and gas/liquid fraction), but also on the pipe geometry.",['spi']
Shaping the pace - a digital design heuristics tool to support creation of urban design by non-professionnals,"Over the last years participation in urban design and planning has gained interest of research institutions, and more particularly ICT-mediated citizen participation in urban projects.

We propose a framework to support interactions between non-professionals and professionals that will ease the understanding of urban design and creation of design proposals for non-trained people and, on the other hand, offer valuable propositions and inspiration to experts. The paper is first offering an overview of the existing methodologies and tools for participatory urban design, followed by a presentation of a case-study in marseille.

Force and vibrotactile integration for 3D user interaction within virtual environments,"Proper integration of sensory cues facilitates 3D user interaction within virtual environments (VEs). Studies on multi-sensory integration of visual and haptic cues revealed that the integration follows maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Little effort focuses however on integrating force and vibrotactile cues - two sub-categorical cues of the haptic modality. Hence, this paper presents an investigation on MLE's suitability for integrating these sub-categorical cues. Within a stereoscopic VE, human users performed a 3D interactive task of navigating a flying drone along a high-voltage transmission line in an inaccessible region and identifying defects on the line. The users had to identify defects via individual force or vibrotactile cues, and their combinations in co-located and dislocated settings. The co-located setting provided both cues on the right hand of the users; whereas the dislocated setting delivered the force and vibrotactile cues on the right hand and forearm of the users, respectively. Task performance of the users, such as completion time and accuracy, was assessed under each cue and setting. The presence of the vibrotactile cue promoted a better performance than the force cue alone. This was in agreement with the role of tactile cues in sensing surface properties, herein setting a baseline for using MLE. The task performance under the co-located setting indicated certain degrees of combining those under the individual cues. In contrast, the performance under the dislocated setting was alike that under the individual vibrotactile cue. These observations imply an inconclusiveness of MLE to integrate both cues in a co-located setting for 3D user interaction.",['info']

Collaborative Design and Supervision Processes Meta-Model for Rationale Capitalization,"Companies act today in a collaborative way, and have to master their product design and supervision processes to remain productive and reactive to the perpetual changes in the industrial context. To achieve this, authors propose a three-layers framework. In the first layer, the design process is modelled. In the second, the traces related to the decisional process are captured. In the third, both the collected traces and the design context model are used to support decision-making. In this paper, authors address the first two issues by proposing a meta-model that allows one to capture the process’ decisional knowledge. The proposal is presented and then illustrated in a case study.",['info']
Defining an Indicator for Navigation Performance Measurement in VE Based on ISO/IEC15939,"Navigation is a key factor for immersion and exploration in virtual environment (VE). Nevertheless, measuring navigation performance is not an easy task, especially when analyzing and interpreting heterogeneous results of the measures used. To that end, we propose, in this paper, a new indicator for measuring navigation performance in VE based on ISO/IEC 15939 standard. It allows effective integration of heterogeneous results by retaining its raw values. Also, it provides a new method that offers a comprehensive graphical visualization of the data for interpreting the results. The experimental study had shown the feasibility of this indicator and its contribution to statistical results.",['info']
On the detection of over-constrained subparts of configurations when deforming free-form curves,"Today, designers use CAD modelers to define and modify NURBS surfaces involved in the design of complex shapes like car bodies or turbine blades. The generated shapes often result from the use of variational modeling techniques where user-specified constraints define the shapes. However, for free-form curve/surfaces, if too much constraints are added to subparts of a configuration, the system will not be solvable even if it is globally well-/under-constrained. When this happens, it is useful to identify locally unsatisfiable subparts of configurations and provide the user feedback for adjustment. Currently, in the domain of geometric constraint solving, techniques are mainly developed for Euler geometries rather than parametric entities like free-form curves/surfaces. In this paper, we apply the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition method to isolate structural over-constrained subparts of configurations. Since structural over-constraints do not necessarily mean unsatisfiable, a Jacobian matrix analysis approach is taken to further detect the inconsistent constraints. Indeed, these numerical methods can be generalized to detect overconstraints on free-form curves. We illustrate our approach on different examples where results show that Gauss elimination, though restricted to linear cases, is more relevant in our context than Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition.","['info', 'spi']"
Comparing VR Environments for Seat Selection in an Opera Theater,"This study presents a comparison of the influence of different VR environments in the task of selecting a preferred seat in an opera theater. We used gaze-based raycasting and headsets in a low-cost head-mounted display (HMD) (GearVR); and a virtual wand, head tracking, and headsets in a CAVE, two somewhat opposing technologies in the spectrum of current VR systems. Visual rendering and the selection technique depend on the capabilities of each environment, whereas the sound is approximated in both environments. Results show that subjects can select similar seats but their decisions differ between both environments. The results obtained can be useful in guiding the development of future VR applications.",['info']
Effects on User Experience in an Edutainment Virtual Environment: Comparison Between CAVE and HMD,"The user experience in immersive virtual environment can be broadly defined by the feeling of presence and immersion in a virtual environment. The propensity of feeling “there” and “enveloped by” in the virtual environment seems to be essential in offering a high quality of experience. However, this user experience definition is partial and neglects other components of the user experience in immersive virtual environments. We consider the overall user experience in immersive virtual environments. In this study, we use our unified questionnaire to measure, analyze and compare the user experience of two immersive virtual devices (i.e., a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment and a Mobile Head Mounted Display). 21 participants took place in this study and assessed the user experience of these devices through the “King Tut VR2” edutainment virtual application. The results show that the CAVE induced a greater user experience than the HMD with significant difference in presence, engagement, flow, skill, judgement and experience consequence. The results also show no significant difference in immersion, usability, emotion and technology adoption between the CAVE and the HMD.",['info']
Experimental and numerical study of the evolution of stored energy in metallic materials under cyclic loading,"In-service loading conditions usually generate complex cyclic stress states.

APPROACH FOR NUMERICAL MODELING OF AIRFOIL DYNAMIC STALL,"The aim of the computational study is to present different approach for numerical modeling of airfoil dynamic stall as the airfoil is pitched at a constant rate from zero incidences to a high angle of attack. An application of the Detached-Eddy Simulation model on a NACA 0012 airfoil is presented. The DES model is a method for predicting turbulence in CFD computations, which combines a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method in the boundary layer with a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) in the free shear flow. (DES) turbulence model gives a good accuracy of the flow field because its solves an additional equation for turbulent Reynolds number in a shear stress transport version (SST), which solves a first equation for the turbulent energy K and a second equation for the specific turbulent dissipation rate w. The approach using DES turbulence model is effective because it gives better visualization of flow field, the unsteady separation flow and vortex shedding. Consequently the suggested approach is suitable and it can be used in prediction of dynamic stall phenomenon in the stage of helicopter rotors, wind turbine rotors and aircraft wings design purposes.","['spi', 'phys']"
FRICTION AND WEAR BEHAVIOUR OF Ti-6AI-7Nb BIOMATERIAL ALLOY,"Titanium and its alloys have been used as implant materials due to their very good mechanical and corrosion resistance and biocompatibility [1,2]. The most used biomaterials were commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti} issued in clinics, although CP- Ti has been pointed out to have disadvantages of low strength, difficulty for polishing, and poor wear resistance. Therefore, Titanium is still insufficient for high-stress applications ; e.g., long spanned fixed prostheses and the frameworks of removable partial dentures.Ti-6Al-4V alloy, originally developped as an aeronautical material, has been tested as a replacement for CP-Ti, because of its high mechanical properties with sufficient corrosion resistance[3], however, the cytoxicity of elemental Vanadium is questionable. Subsequently, some researches prove that vanadium and aluminum ions released from this ternary alloy can induce cytoxic effects or neurological disorders, respectively [4]. Also, for long-term, this alloy has transferred in sufficient load to adjacent bones, resulting in good resorbption and eventual loosening of the implant. Another ternary alloy used as implants was vanadium free, a+ii alloy, especially Ti-6Al-7Nb alloy that revealed improved mechanical characteristics, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility , developed for orthopedics application as a wrought material, has been evaluated as a new alloy for total hip prostheses. Niobium exhibits a similar effect to vanadium instabilizing ii phase in the Ti-Nb binary system, which is necessary for providing the a -ii two-phase structure. Therefore, niobium was used as the ternary element to produce the desirable microstructure in the Ti-6Al-7Nb alloy. Ascompared with Ti-6Al-4 V alloy, in a tensile test, these alloy show slightly lower strength and about 40% higher elongation.",['spi']
Shot peening analysis on trip780 steel exhibiting martensitic transformation,"The microstructure and mechanical fields were studied on a cold-rolled TRIP 780 steel after conventional shot peening, and with or without pre-strain; for the first time, results were compared to numerical simulations at the phase scale. 1. The pre-strain does not affect residual stresses in the different phases nor the affected depth but it shifts the austenite fraction value towards lower values. 2.

The user experience measurement : a challenge of the twenty-first century,"Technologies are at the heart of the 21st century revolution. They are more and more changing the way we work, learn and the way we define human. Recently, researchers have been trying to understand and master technologies through the concept of User eXperience (UX). ISO DIS 9241-210 tentatively defines UX as ""all aspects of the user’s experience when interacting with the product, service, environment or facility. This is why, UX has been in the last years an approach used in numerous disciplines (e.g., HCI, ergonomics, information architecture, branding, ...) to improve user-centric products or services. No doubt is made that UX is still an important dimension in product quality. A specific product that highlights the importance of considering UX is virtual reality (VR), a technology greatly in vogue that provides applications to the general public. Studies show that UX consideration can alleviate the cybersickness (e.g., nausea, vertigo, disorientation, ...) affecting users in VR [1]. Today’s technologies are more complex, they are fashionable, they stimulate the user's senses, they are immaterial. Therefore, early UX research strategy, rather than focusing on instrumental measures, focuses on more holistic subjective perceptions such as hedonic qualities, affects or emotions. The report is clear: most UX evaluation methods are subjective, self-developed or not statistically validated [2]. There is an urge for clear measurement standards for UX evaluation. The current situation is alarming since a product’s intrinsic quality does not have to be subjective but has to be objectively measured in order to be easily compared and controlled. According to the International Vocabulary of Metrology (i.e., VIM 3), a measurement process should generate ‘‘one or more quantity values that can reasonably be attributed to a quantity”. Moreover, “the results of the process, by which quantity values have been obtained, are characterized by the metrological compatibility, metrological comparability and, if necessary, metrological traceability” [3]. It is currently not the case for UX. Consequently, the main challenge UX is facing in this 21st century context, is to ensure that new products and services provide good UX to users. To do so, UX research needs to define actual “objective measurement” metrics whether the UX criterion is hedonic (e.g., pleasure, motivation, satisfaction, ...) or instrumental (e.g., performances, ...). This requires UX to be defined and determined as a measurement result. In this paper, we cover the importance of designing UX measurement methods in order to turn UX as a mesurande. We review several studies in which objective UX methods are proposed for UX assessment. We focus on the few measurement techniques existing today such as electroencephalographic and electromyographic responses that, in some cases, are used to assess objective UX (i.e., user mental state, facial expressions). Finally, we point out the difficult technical challenge UX measurement represent today, as, technologies to properly evaluate the user’s perceptions do not exist or are still immature.",['shs']
Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) for numerical calculation of polycrystalline aggregates under cyclic loading,"This study aims at the developing of a numerical method for the resolution of the finite element for nonlinear viscoplastic problems. For this, two ideas are used. The first is to maintain a constant stiffness matrix [4] to do only one factorization.

This method, which is based on radial approximation , has shown its effectiveness in solving problems with a large number of degrees of freedom",['spi']
Numerical Study of Railway Track Dynamics : Case of a Transition Zone,"The main objective of this paper is to present an innovative numerical tool to represent the track and platform dynamic behavior under passing trains. Dynavoie is currently being developed for engineering purposes at SNCF. It is specifically designed to correctly reproduce the track and platform dynamic behaviors in the time domain. This model is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), adapted to the railway track using model reduction techniques. Taking advantage of the periodicity of the track introduced by the regular sleeper spacing, one or several basic slices containing all the geometric properties of the structure can be identified. Static and periodic responses of these slices are computed. Then, reduction is performed using these deformations.Thus the number of degrees of freedom of the model is highly reduced. This reduction induces a decrease in computation time with limited accuracy loss in the representation of track dynamics. The methodology will be further described in this paper. The second novelty of this work is to use this model to analyze the dynamic behavior of a transition zone located in a French high speed line.",['spi']

Software assembly and open standards for driving simulation,"Driving simulation systems involve a combination of different computation codes. Although some of these modules are application-specific, their majority is reusable and state-of-the-art implementations are readily available in the open source community. This study investigates whether these open source libraries can combine to build a driving simulation application with reasonable performance. To this end, a component-oriented architecture is proposed, in which modules encapsulate relevant libraries behind a standard interface and exchange simulation data through a message passing interface. By integrating a render engine, a physics library and a simple vehicle dynamics model, we were able to rapidly build a functional minimal simulation application supporting distributed execution over a cluster of computers. As this architecture allows the transparent modification of module code and simplifies the addition of new modules, this kernel represents the foundations of an extensible and reconfigurable open source system dedicated to driving simulation.

Interfacial damage and load transfermodeling in short fiber reinforced composites,"Due to the compromise between their thermomechanical properties and low density, Short Fiber Reinforced Polyamides (SFRP) present a good alternative to metals for automotive structural components. The microstructure of such materials, combined with the matrix sensitivity to environmental conditions, has a strong impact on their overall behavior and the related damage. A new multi-scale modelling strategy is proposed, based on the experimental observations of interfacial damage evolution for PA66-GF30 composites. Three main key-points have been integrated to this approach: an original damage evolution law at the interface, an appropriate load transfer law at the matrix-fiber interface, and a homogenization strategy founded on the generalized Mori-Tanaka scheme. The damage evolution law is driven by a local probabilistic criterion based on the interfacial stress field estimation. This type of evolution depends on the maximal local damage rate at the fiber/matrix interface, determined from a numerical evaluation at several points of the interface surrounding the inclusion. It is then coupled with a load transfer law formulated according to a modified shear lag model (SLM). The developed model is assessed with a finite element (FE) computation integrating cohesive elements at the matrix-fiber interface. The FE unit cell consists in a periodic media (hexagonal array) with periodic boundary conditions. The fiber-matrix interface integrates cohesive elements, with a cohesive law driven by a Paulino-Park-Roesler (PPR) potential-based formulation. The latter has been proven to be suitable for the 3D modeling of interface in reinforced composites. The proposed approach is able to accurately capture the non-linear behavior of short fiber reinforced polyamide composites accounting for interfacial damage.",['spi']

The preliminary results appears to fit those presented in the literature.","['info', 'spi']"
On the Model Order Reduction of Confined Plasticity,"Forming processes usually involve irreversible plastic transformations. The calculation in that case becomes cumbersome when large parts and processes are considered. Recently Model Order Reduction techniques opened new perspectives for an accurate and fast simulation of mechanical systems. In some processes, plastic deformations remain very localized, for example in the immediate neighborhood of the surface. In that case, the in-plane characteristic dimension is several orders of magnitude higher than the one related to the deepness in which plasticity localizes. In those situations the use of standard mesh-based 3D discretization is challenging because the extremely different characteristic dimensions that to capture all the information requires the use of millions of nodes.",['spi']
Mechanical characterization of composite materials from curved structures,"Mechanical behavior of composite laminates depends strongly on the manufacturing process. It is necessary to use representative samples of the material, and therefore of the process. In the case of filament winding, specimens are necessarily cylindrical or barrel extracted. In our case, a full-scale fiberglass composite structure is used for radial compression and axial cuts experimental performances. This work aims to estimate the elastic properties of composite laminate from a curved structure taking into account the manufacturing process. An inverse approach using an optimization process is adopted. By coupling a radial compression experiment with a 3D model obtained by Finite Element Method (FEM), a mechanical characterization becomes possible. Furthermore, these identifications combined with experiments of axial cuts enable the estimation of residual manufacturing stresses.",['spi']
Non-invasive assessment of human multifidus muscle stiffness using ultrasound shear wave elastography: A feasibility study,"INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of numeric data for the mechanical characterization of spine muscles, especially in vivo data. The multifidus muscle is a major muscle for the stabilization of the spine and may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic low back pain (LBP). Supersonic shear wave elastography (SWE) has not yet been used on back muscles. The purpose of this prospective study is to assess the feasibility of ultrasound SWE to measure the elastic modulus of lumbar multifidus muscle in a passive stretching posture and at rest with a repeatable and reproducible method. METHOD: A total of 10 asymptotic subjects (aged 25.5±2.2 years) participated, 4 females and 6 males. Three operators performed 6 measurements for each of the 2 postures on the right multifidus muscle at vertebral levels L2-L3 and L4-L5. Repeatability and reproducibility have been assessed according to ISO 5725 standard. RESULTS: Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for intra- and inter observer reliability were rated as both excellent [ICC=0.99 and ICC=0.95, respectively]. Reproducibility was 11% at L2-L3 level and 19% at L4-L5. In the passive stretching posture, shear modulus was significantly higher than at rest (u<0.05). DISCUSSION: This preliminary work enabled to validate the feasibility of measuring the shear modulus of the multifidus muscle with SWE. This kind of measurement could be easily introduces into clinical routine like for the medical follow-up of chronic LBP or scoliosis treatments.","['sdv', 'spi']"
Design Elements for high speed SRM,"This paper deals with the study of high speed switched reluctance motors and their pre-dimensioning. The predimensioning is tackled towards the inductance profile and the torque generation. Then, the power density is assessed in terms of three defined fundamental parameters, each depending on electrical, mechanical and geometrical design of the motor. The mechanical limitations studied are the centrifugal stresses and the vibratory behavior of the motor. A shape optimization of the rotor teeth leans then on a coupled magnetic-mechanic coupled problem, solved with finite elements simulations. After that,mechanic, magnetic and copper losses are given in terms of the rotor external volume so as to assess the weight of each heat source in the global motor heating. Once all the losses are linked to temperature, a criterion to improve the ability to develop a high speed motor is finally proposed.",['spi']

Information such as the sequence of actions (create a sketch, set a distance constraint, remove a pocket, modify the diameter of a through hole, etc.), versioning of the created objects, etc. is missing. This information can be used to understand how a designer uses CAD software to generate geometric representations. In design companies, capturing this information during a product design project would help to evaluate the designer’s way of working with CAD software. In design education, collecting information on how design students generate geometric representations would allow teachers to identify the areas of misunderstanding, improve the education process by representing the optimal way of working, and help teachers to correctly evaluate their students’ performance in using CAD software. This paper proposes a framework to support an analysis of how designers use CAD software to generate geometric representations. This framework consists of structured models and an approach which guides the actor in capturing the design process. We use CATIA as a CAD software solution, but the proposed approach is generic and can be extended to any CAD software. The validity of the proposed approach is illustrated through a case study.","['info', 'spi']"
Colloidal Particle Deposition in Porous Media Under Flow: A Numerical Approach,The objective of this study is to simulate the transport and deposition of colloidal particles at the pore scale by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations (CFD). This consists in the three-dimensional numerical modeling of the process of transport and deposition of colloidal particles in a porous medium idealized as a bundle of capillaries of circular cross section. The velocity field obtained by solving the Stokes and continuity equations is superimposed to particles diffusion and particles are let to adsorb when they closely approach the solid wall. Once a particle is adsorbed the flow velocity field is updated before a new particle is injected. Our results show that both adsorption probability and surface coverage are decreasing functions of the particle’s Péclet number. At low Péclet number values when diffusion is dominant the surface coverage is shown to approach the Random Sequential Adsorption value while it drops noticeably for high Péclet number values. Obtained data were also used to calculate the loss of porosity and permeability.,['spi']
Scope Definition on End-of-Life Chain Performance Assessment: Recycling Rate and French E-Waste Chain Case Study,"Efficiency indicators have been frequently used to assess end-of-life chain performance. While legislations give a standard definition, sometimes stakeholders redefine them to fit their own scopes and objectives. It is therefore necessary to fully understand the indicators calculation scope in order to accurately interpret the results during a decision-making process. This work discusses the influence of scope definition when establishing performance rates using the French e-waste chain and recycling rate as an example. Complementary recycling rates to the one established by WEEE Directive are proposed.","['sde', 'spi']"

Natural Language Processing of Requirements for Model-Based Product Design with ENOVIA CATIA V6,"The enterprise level software application that supports the strategic product-centric, lifecycle-oriented and information-driven Product Lifecycle Management business approach should enable engineers to develop and manage requirements within a Functional Digital Mock-Up. The integrated, model-based product design ENOVIA/CATIA V6 RFLP environment makes it possible to use parametric modelling among requirements, functions, logical units and physical organs. Simulation can therefore be used to verify that the design artefacts comply with the requirements. Nevertheless, when dealing with document-based specifications, the definition of the knowledge parameters for each requirement is a labour-intensive task. Indeed, analysts have no other alternative than to go through the voluminous specifications, to identify the performance requirements and design constraints, and to translate them into knowledge parameters. We propose to use natural language processing techniques to automatically generate Parametric Property-Based Requirements from unstructured and semi-structured specifications. We illustrate our approach through the design of a mechanical ring.",['info']

Friction and Wear Behavior of Ti-6Al-7Nb Biomaterial Alloy,"Titanium has been increasingly applied to biomedical application because of its improved mechanical characteristics, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. However their application remains limited, due to the low strength and poor wear resistance of unalloyed titanium. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the friction and wear behavior of high-strength titanium alloys: Ti-6Al-7Nb used in femoral stem (total hip prosthesis). The oscillating friction and wear tests have been carried out in ambient air with oscillating tribotester in accord with standards ISO 7148, ASTM G99-95a, ASTM G 133-95 under different conditions of normal applied load (3, 6 and 10 N) and sliding speed (1, 15 and 25 mm·s−1), and as a counter pair we used the ball of 100C 6, 10 mm of diameter. The surface morphology of the titanium alloys has been characterized by SEM, EDAX, micro hardness, roughness analysis measurements. The behav-ior observed for both samples suggests that the wear and friction mechanism during the test is the same for Ti alloys, and to increase resistance to wear and friction of biomedical titanium alloys used in total hip prosthesis (femoral stems) the surface coating and treatment are required.","['sdv', 'spi']"
Constitutive modeling of shape memory alloys incorporating transformation-induced plasticity and damage,"Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are exploited in several innovative applications such as biocompatible actuators experiencing up to large number of cyclic loads.

A Collaborative Requirement-Mining framework to support OEMs,"With the fastidiously ever-increasing complexity of systems, the relentless, massive customisation of products and the mushrooming accumulation of legal documents (standards, policies and laws), we observe a signi cant increase in requirements.

This paper suggests a collaborative requirement-mining framework to enable the decision-makers of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to gain insight and discover opportunities in a massive set of requirements so as to make early e ective strategic decisions. The framework supports OEMs willing to distil a subset of key requirements from large unstructured and semi-structured speci cations.",['info']

Quantitative and representative adherence assessment of coated and uncoated concrete-formwork,"Nowadays buildings construction is performed by pouring concrete into molds called formworks that are usually prefabricated metallic modules. Defects such as stripping may possibly form during the removal of the formwork if the interfacial bonding between the concrete and the formwork is high. Making use of a new pull-off tensile test designed in our laboratory, a correlation has been established between the formwork surface functional signatures and its adherence propensity to concrete. The originality of this near-to-surface test was to characterize the concrete-to-formwork adherence by measuring the required force to pull the concrete from the formwork surface. The design of the test coupon was validated by finite element analysis that proves the small deformation of the tested formwork specimen under the tensile loading and the homogeneity of the applied tensile stress at the interface. The interfacial bonding to concrete has been compared between bare and coated formwork. Both metallic and polymer coatings have been studied. The analyses of the pull-off test results enabled us to understand the bonding mechanisms at the concrete-coating interfaces. The pull-off tensile test was proven capable of ranking formwork coatings according to their adherence to concrete.",['spi']

The “Weight” of Words on the Forearms During Relaxation,"In this paper we examined the influence of repetition of weight-related sentences on the involuntary pressure forces of the forearms, when in a relaxed state. These forces were involuntary oscillations, exerted by muscle movements of the breathing-cycle and muscle movements of the arm on force sensors. We constructed a linguistic bio-mechanical system (Ablasmi), where in each arm of a padded relaxation chair contained special sensors that were specifically designed to detect the pressure forces of each forearm while participants listened to the specific recorded weight-related sentences. In this experiment we used some classic sentences, such as ''your right/left arm is heavy,'' inspired by Autogenic Training (Schultz in Le training autogene. Paris, PUF, 1974) and some sentences, such as ''your right/left arm is made of lead,'' inspired by Grossmann's relaxation technique. We observed that when the recorded sentences were directed to the right arm there was a significant increase of involuntary pressure forces on the right forearm. Additionally, we observed the same effect on the left forearm for the sentences directed to the left forearm. Thus, we believe we have provided experimental evidence of a definite linguistic effect of weight-related sentences on the involuntary pressure forces of the forearms. The implications of these findings are discussed. Keywords Effects of weight-related sentences Á Heaviness of the arms Á Autogenic training Á Relaxation Á Metaphors of weight","['scco', 'shs']"
"Residual stress, mechanical and microstructure properties of multilayer Mo2N/CrN coating produced by R.F Magnetron discharge","We have investigated the effect of the period thickness of the multilayer Mo2N/CrN deposited on Si substrate produced by reactive magnetron sputtering. Mo2N presents a face centered cubic structure and CrN an orthorhombic one. The residual stress of the coatings was determined by the measurement of the substrate curvature. The microstructure of the multilayer was investigated from the X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (cross section images). The residual stresses resulting from the deposition of the different bi-layer thickness were measured and correlated to the structural properties of the coating as well as the nanoindentation analysis of the coating. The stresses are compressive and tensile for the individual Mo2N and CrN layer respectively. The result shows that an increase of the multilayer coatings Mo2N/CrN thicknesses induce an increase of the hardness and the elastic modulus, in the other hand the tensile stress increases. The shift of the XRD diffraction peak (1 1 1) of Mo2N at high angle which means the reduction of the residual stress is in good agreement with the residual stresses measurements.","['spi', 'phys']"
"Structure design of naphthalimide derivatives: towards versatile photo-initiators for near UV/Visible LEDs, 3D printing and water soluble photoinitiating systems","Seven naphthalimide derivatives (NDP1–NDP7) with different substituents have been designed as versatile photoinitiators (PIs), and some of them when combined with an iodonium salt (and optionally N-vinylcarbazole) or an amine (and optionally chlorotriazine) are expected to exhibit an enhanced efficiency to initiate the cationic polymerization of epoxides and the free radical polymerization of acrylates under different irradiation sources (i.e., the LED at 385, 395, 405, 455, or 470 nm or the polychromatic visible light from the halogen lamp). Remarkably, some studied naphthalimide derivative based photoinitiating systems (PIS) are even more efficient than the commercial type I photoinitiator bisacylphosphine oxide and the well-known camphorquinone-based systems for cationic or radical photopolymerization. A good efficiency upon a LED projector at 405 nm used in 3D printers is also found: a 3D object can be easily created through an additive process where the final object is constructed by coating down successive layers of material. As another example of their broad potential, a NDP compound enveloped in a cyclodextrin (CD) cavity, leads to a NDP–CD complex which appears as a very efficient water-soluble photoinitiator when combined with methyldiethanol amine to form a hydrogel. The high interest of the present photoinitiator (NDP2) is its very high reactivity, allowing synthesis in water upon LED irradiation as a green way for polymer synthesis.The structure/reactivity/efficiency relationships as well as the photochemical mechanisms associated with the generation of the active species (radicals or cations) are studied by different techniques including steady state photolysis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, and electron spin resonance spin-trapping methods.",['chim']
Radiochemical 'degelation' of polymethyl methacrylate networks,"Methyl methacrylate-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate networks were synthetized and submitted to radiochemical degradation, with ageing monitored by means of sol-gel analysis. The networks were shown to undergo chain scission predominantly, which leads to their degelation, i.e., the recovery of a thermoplastic-like behavior with loss of all elastically active chains. The degelation dose was shown to increase with crosslink density and the corresponding critical conversion ratio was discussed regarding a recent and general statistical theory that covers radiochemical as well as chemical chain scissions.","['chim', 'spi']"
Numerical integration of rate-independent BCC single crystal plasticity models: comparative study of two classes of numerical algorithms,"In an incremental formulation suitable to numerical implementation, the use of rate-independent theory of crystal plasticity essentially leads to four fundamental problems. The first is to determine the set of potentially active slip systems over a time increment. The second is to select the active slip systems among the potentially active ones. The third is to compute the slip rates (or the slip increments) for the active slip systems. And the last problem is the possible non-uniqueness of slip rates. The purpose of this paper is to propose satisfactory responses to the above-mentioned first three issues by presenting and comparing two novel numerical algorithms. The first algorithm is based on the usual return-mapping integration scheme, while the second follows the so-called ultimate scheme. The latter is shown to be more relevant and efficient than the former. These comparative performances are illustrated through various numerical simulations of the mechanical behavior of single crystals and polycrystalline aggregates subjected to monotonic and complex loadings. Although these algorithms are applied in this paper to Body-Centered-Cubic (BCC) crystal structures, they are quite general and suitable for integrating the constitutive equations for other crystal structures (e.g., FCC and HCP).",['spi']
Isothermal crystallization kinetic modeling of poly(etherketoneketone) (PEKK) copolymer,"Isothermal melt and cold crystallizations of a poly(etherketoneketone) (PEKK) copolymer prepared from diphenyl ether (DPE), terephthalic acid (T) and isophthalic acid (I) with a T/I ratio of 60/40 have been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, wide-angle X-ray scattering and polarized optical microscopy. For the first time, the two-stage overall crystallization kinetics of PEKK taking into account effects of nucleation and crystal growth has been identified by using a modified Hillier type model. The primary crystallization stage is found to be an instantaneous two dimensional nucleation growth with an Avrami exponent of 2 whereas the secondary stage is found to be an instantaneous one dimensional nucleation growth with an Avrami exponent of 1. The evolution of the crystallization kinetic constants for two-stage crystallizations has been modeled according to the Hoffman and Lauritzen growth theory. Due to low crystallization kinetics, a crystallization induction time has been added to obtain a good fit with experimental data. Based on this modeling, Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagrams of the relative volume crystallinity have been established for the overall crystallization mechanism and also for the separated primary and secondary crystallization mechanisms providing an original crystallization mapping of the material.",['spi']
Hybrid experimental/modelling methodology for identifying the convective heat transfer coefficient in cryogenic assisted machining,"Cryogenic assisted machining has become a very popular method in the metal cutting industry, as it enables the cooling of a cutting zone for improving surface integrity or/and tool life without contaminating the machined part. However, the thermal interaction between liquid nitrogen (LN2) and a hot cutting zone remains unclear. The main objective of this work is to analyse the thermal phenomena occurring at the LN2 jet/workpiece interface. The nitrogen liquid/gas phase proportion has a significant influence on the heat transfer. To determine the influence of LN2 jet parameters on the convective heat transfer coefficient, a model based on the projection of an LN2 jet on a workpiece instrumented with thermocouples is proposed. The most influential parameters of the thermal distribution and heat transfer coefficient are LN2 pressure, nozzle diameter, projection angle and the distance between the nozzle and the workpiece surface.",['spi']
The effect of ageing process on three-point bending strength and permeability of 3D printed sand molds,"The objective of this paper was to investigate the effects of curing parameters (i.e., temperature and time), on the permeability and mechanical strength of the printed molds. Several sets of samples were hence produced with a state-of-the-art 3D printer using well-characterized silica sand and furan resin binder. Then, experiments were performed in which the evolution over time of the three-point bending (3 PB) strength and permeability of the samples were monitored at three different curing temperatures. From these measurements, both the individual and combined effects of curing temperature and time on the functionality of the 3D printed molds were assessed. Moreover, loss-on-ignition (LOI) tests were also performed in order to relate the loss of binder mass to the variation in permeability and mechanical strength of the samples. The results showed that the printed molds can be stored at room temperature for a long time before being used, roughly preserving the initial properties. No significant change in 3 PB strength was observed when curing at 100 °C. In contrast, the permeability was shown to decrease with increasing curing temperature.",['spi']
Towards an Intelligent System for Generating an Adapted Verbal and Nonverbal Combined Behavior in Human–Robot Interaction,"In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios , an intelligent robot should be able to synthesize an appropriate behavior adapted to human profile (i.e., personality). Recent research studies discussed the effect of personality traits on human verbal and nonverbal behaviors. The dynamic characteristics of the generated gestures and postures during the nonverbal communication can differ according to personality traits, which similarly can influence the verbal content of human speech. This research tries to map human verbal behavior to a corresponding verbal and nonverbal combined robot behavior based on the extraversion-introversion personality dimension. We explore the human-robot personality matching aspect and the similarity attraction principle, in addition to the different effects of the adapted combined robot behavior expressed through speech and gestures, and the adapted speech-only robot behavior, on interaction. Experiments with the humanoid NAO robot are reported.",['info']
Influence of the Yield Surface Curvature on the Forming Limit Diagrams Predicted by Crystal Plasticity Theory,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of the microscopic yield surface (i.e., at the single crystal scale) on the forming limit diagrams (FLDs) of face centred cubic (FCC) materials. To predict these FLDs, the bifurcation approach is used within the framework of rate-independent crystal plasticity theory. For this purpose, two micromechanical models are developed and implemented. The first one uses the classical Schmid law, which results in the formation of vertices (or corners) at the yield surface, while the second is based on regularization of the Schmid law, which induces rounded corners at the yield surface. In both cases, the overall macroscopic behavior is derived from the behavior of the microscopic constituents (the single crystals) by using two different scale-transition schemes: the selfconsistent approach and the Taylor model. The simulation results show that the use of the classical Schmid law allows predicting localized necking at realistic strain levels for the whole range of strain paths that span the FLD. However, the application of a regularized Schmid law results in much higher limit strains in the range of negative strain paths. Moreover, rounding the yield surface vertices through regularization of the Schmid law leads to unrealistically high limit strains in the range of positive strain paths.",['spi']
Predictive coalescence modeling of particles from different polymers: application to PVDF and PMMA pair,"This paper aims to study the coalescence phenomenon of two different polymers PVDF and PMMA. The paper is divided in two parts: the first part is devoted to the experimental work, and the second one focuses on the modeling of the coalescence phenomenon. The first step was a physicochemical and rheological characterization. Then, the coalescence tests have been performed on droplets derived from PVDF and PMMA polymers using a polarized light optical microscope combined with a hot stage. The effect of several significant parameters like temperature and particle size was investigated. The second part of this study is focused on the modeling of the coalescence phenomenon based on the well-known Bellehumeur model. The latter has been commonly used to describe the coalescence phenomenon between identical grains. The novelty of the present work consists in the extension of the coalescence model to wider describe the coalescence phenomenon between grains of different polymers. In addition, probabilistic analysis was performed in order to investigate the effect of the parameters governing the coalescence model, namely the viscosity, the surface tension and the relaxation time. The results have shown a good compromise between the experimental results and the predictive generalized Bellehumeur model.",['spi']
Phenomenological study of multivariable effects on exit burr criteria during orthogonal cutting of AlSi alloys using principal components analysis,"During machining, burrs are produced along a part’s edges, which can affect a final product lifetime or its efficiency. Moreover, time-consuming and expensive techniques are needed to be applied to remove such burrs. Therefore, companies attempt to reduce burrs formation during machining by manipulating the cutting conditions. This study aims to analyze and quantify the effect of a wide number of parameters on burr formation, resulting from different mechanisms, during orthogonal cutting of AlSi alloys. A highly developed experimental methodology combining high-speed camera recording, laser scanning, and in situ deburring system is used for this study. A statistical analysis is then applied to evaluate relations between controlled parameters and the occurrence of exit burrs morphologies. The results show that the uncut chip thickness influences burr types distribution along the exit edge and chamfer geometry. Among the cutting parameters and tool geometry, tool rake angle is the main parameter affecting burr height. Finally, it is found that none of the burrs geometrical characteristics ranges are piloted by cutting parameters or tool geometry. The assumption of a possible microstructural influence on these outputs is made.",['spi']
"The lengthening of a giant protein: When, how, and why?","Subcommissural organ (SCO)-spondin is a giant glycoprotein of more than 5000 amino acids found in Vertebrata, expressed in the central nervous system and constitutive of Reissner’s fiber. For the first time, in situ hybridization performed on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos shows that the gene encoding this protein is expressed transitionally in the floor plate, the ventral midline of the neural tube, and later in the diencephalic third ventricle roof, the SCO. The modular organization of the protein in Echinodermata (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), Urochordata (Ciona savignyi and C. intestinalis), and Vertebrata (Teleostei, Amphibia, Aves and Mammalia) is also described. As the thrombospondin type 1 repeat motifs represent an increasingly large part of the protein during Deuterostomia evolution, the duplication mechanisms leading to this complex organization are examined. The functional significance of the particularly well-preserved arrangement of the series of SCO-spondin repeat motifs and thombospondin type 1 repeats is discussed.",['sdv']

Local behavior of an AISI 304 stainless steel submitted to in situ biaxial loading in SEM,"The microstructural response of a coarse grained AISI 304 stainless steel submitted to biaxial tensile loading was investigated using SEM and X-ray diffraction. The specimen geometry was designed to allow for biaxial stress state and incipient crack in the center of the active part under biaxial tensile loading. This complex loading was performed step by step by a micromachine fitting into a SEM chamber. At each loading step FSD pictures and EBSD measurements were carried out to study the microstructural evolution of the alloy, namely grain rotations and misorientations, stress-induced martensite formation and crack propagation. According to their initial orientation, grains are found to behave differently under loading. Approximately 60% of grains are shown to reorient to the [110] Z orientation under biaxial tensile loading, whereas the 40% left undergo high plastic deformation. EBSD and XRD measurements respectively performed under loading and on the postmortem specimen highlighted the formation of about 4% of martensite.",['spi']
SOME PROPERTIES AND AN APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIAL POLYNOMIALS,"In the paper, the authors introduce a notion ""multivariate exponential polynomials"" which generalize exponential numbers and polynomials, establish explicit formulas, inversion formulas, and recurrence relations for multivariate exponential polynomials in terms of the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds with the help of the Fàa di Bruno formula, two identities for the Bell polynomials of the second kind, and the inversion theorem for the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds, construct some determinantal inequalities and product inequalities for multivariate exponential polynomials with the aid of some properties of completely monotonic functions and other known results, derive the logarithmic convexity and logarithmic concavity for multivariate exponential polynomials, and finally find an application of multi-variate exponential polynomials to white noise distribution theory by confirming that multivariate exponential polynomials satisfy conditions for sequences required in white noise distribution theory.",['math']
Kinetic-fluid derivation and mathematical analysis of cross-diffusion-Brinkman system,"In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear model describing dynamical interaction of two species within viscous flow. The proposed model is a cross-diffusion system coupled with Brinkman problem written in terms of velocity fluid, vorticity and pressure, and describing the flow patterns driven by an external source depending on the distribution of species. In the first part, we derive a macroscopic models from the kinetic-fluid equations by using the micro-macro decomposition method. Basing on Schauder fixed-point theory, we prove the existence of weak solutions for the derived model in the second part.

Constitutive equations have been formulated for plastic and structural strains, which allow us to describe the stored and dissipated parts of energy under plastic flow. Numerical results indicate that theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimentally observed temperature data.","['spi', 'phys']"
On the elasto-viscoplastic behavior of the Ti5553 alloy,"The elastoviscoplastic behavior of the Ti5553 alloy is characterized and compared to the classical Ti–6Al–4V alloy. The true stress–strain curves are determined based on tensile tests performed under different strain rates at room temperature and at 1501C, from which the elastic constants and the parameters of a Norton–Hoff viscoplastic model are identified. The strength of the Ti5553 alloy is 20–40% higher than the strength of the Ti–6Al–4V alloy. The Ti5553 alloy constitutes thus a promising candidate for advanced structural applications. In view of modeling structural applications of forming operations, the elastic and plastic initial anisotropy of the two alloys is investigated by combining compression on cylinders with elliptical sections, uniaxial tensile tests in different material directions, plane strain and shear tests. The initial anisotropy of the different alloys is very weak which justifies the modeling of the mechanical behavior with an isotropic yield surface. The identified elastoviscoplastic model is validated by comparing experimental results with FE predictions both on cylindrical notched specimens subjected to tensile tests and onflat specimens subjected to plane strain conditions.",['spi']
Epitaxial growth of tantalum carbides by low carbon flow carburizing,"The carburizing of tantalum samples under different carbon flow rates has highlighted the influence of the carbon flow rate on the structure of tantalum carbides. XRD analyses enabled the identification of surface structures that were revealed by optical micrographs. Four carbon flow rates were tested. The lowest carbon flow rate produced a Ta2C layer that grew epitaxially on the tantalum substrate according to the relationship: {View the MathML source101¯}Ta// View the MathML source{1¯101}Ta2C; View the MathML source〈101¯〉Ta// View the MathML source〈17¯17010〉Ta2C. An increase in the carbon flow rate resulted in the appearance of TaC nuclei through the carbon enrichment of the Ta2C layer. These nuclei appeared in the form of islets and highly oriented needles. EBSD (Electron Back Scattered Diffraction) analyses and pole figures revealed that the carbide layers grew epitaxially towards their substrates. The Ta2C layer grew according to the relationship View the MathML source{101¯}Ta// View the MathML source{1¯101}Ta2C while the TaC structures nucleated according to the following relationships: {111}TaC//{0001}Ta2C; 〈111〉TaC//〈0001〉Ta2C; {100}TaC// View the MathML source{202¯3}Ta2C; 〈100〉TaC// View the MathML source〈909¯8〉Ta2C and {110}TaC// View the MathML source{101¯3}Ta2C; 〈110〉TaC// View the MathML source〈909¯16〉Ta2C. The highest carbon flow produced stoichiometric TaC grains at the surface, which appeared to be equiaxed. The diversity of the TaC crystallographic orientations stems from the underlying Ta2C layer, the TaC grains having nucleated epitaxially from the Ta2C layer. This misorientation of the Ta2C grains with respect to Ta is governed by the exceeding of a carbon flow limit.","['chim', 'phys']"
Different composite voxel methods for the numerical homogenization of heterogeneous inelastic materials with FFT-based techniques,"FFT-based homogenization methods aim at calculating the effective behavior of heterogeneous materials with periodic microstructures. These methods operate on a regular grid of voxels, and hence require an appropriate spatial discretization of periodic microstructures. However, when different microstructural length scales are involved, it is not always possible to have sufficient spatial resolutions to explicitly consider the influence of fine microstructural features (e.g. voids, second-phase particles). To circumvent this difficulty, one solution consists of using composite voxel methods to define the effective properties and the effective internal variables of heterogeneous voxels. In this work, different composite voxel methods are proposed to deal with inelastic materials with mul- tiple length scales. These methods use simple homogenization rules to calculate the effective behavior of heterogeneous voxels. The first part of this paper is dedicated to the description of the composite voxel methods, which are based either on the Voigt, laminate structure or Mori–Tanaka approximations. In the second part, these methods are used to model the elasto-plastic behavior of a pearlitic steel poly- crystalline aggregate. According to the results, the Voigt approximation, which ignores morphological fea- tures, is not appropriate for treating heterogeneous voxels. When morphological information is accounted for, with either the laminate structure or Mori–Tanaka approximations, a better agreement with experi- mental observations is obtained. Though none of these methods is universal, they offer some possibilities to investigate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials involving multiple length scales.",['spi']
In-situ experimental and numerical studies of the damage evolution and fracture in a Fe-TiB2 composite,"A joint experimental and modelling study of plastic strain and ensuing damage in a novel metal matrix composite (Fe-TiB2) is presented. Damage is observed and quantified using SEM images processing and Acoustic Emission (AE) analysis. The use of AE confirms that the surface damage observed is strongly correlated to damage in the bulk of the material. The primary mode of damage is particle fracture. Very little particle decohesion is observed, indicating an exceptionally good cohesion of the steel/particle interface. Damage is initiated soon after the composite yield point is reached and increases significantly with strain. Macroscopic failure of the tensile specimen occurs when about 25% of the particles are fractured. This corresponds to about 21% engineering strain. Using in-situ SEM tensile tests with quantitative digital image correlation (DIC), full-field strain measurements are obtained and particle fracture quantified.

A reconfigurable damage-tolerant controller based on a modal double-loop framework,"Active vibration control of flexible structures has received considerable attention in the latest decades. However, several related control problems remain open to new investigations such as robust performance, spillover instability, and structural changes due to damage. Specifically in the case of damage, it may significantly aggravate closed-loop performance. Damage-tolerant active control is a recent research area that includes structural damage effect reduction in the controller design requirements. This paper presents a novel control method based on a modal double-loop controller design, aiming for vibration reduction of noncollocated flexible structures subject to damage and encompassing online reconfigurability. The first controller is designed for the healthy system in order to comply with predefined performance and robustness requirements, based on modal H∞H∞ norm. The second controller complements the closed-loop performance if the structure is damaged. A reconfigurable modal technique is adopted to design the second controller, using online modal structural parameter change information to update the controller. To assess the proposed method, finite element models are developed for a case study structure, including health and damage conditions. Results show the effectiveness of the methodology along with performance improvement compared to single-loop controllers based on regular H∞ and modal H∞ approaches.",['spi']
"Phenomenological multi-mechanisms constitutive modelling for thermoplastic polymers, implicit implementation and experimental validation","In this work, a phenomenological model for thermoplastic polymers involving several mechanisms is proposed. The constitutive equations lie within the framework of thermodynamics and account for both viscoelasticty, viscoplasticity and ductile damage. An implicit numerical scheme utilizing the “return mapping algorithm” is provided along with the formulation of the tangent operator. The parameters of the developed model are experimentally identified through a gradient-based inverse method using three strain-controlled configurations. The model validation is achieved by comparing numerical results with experimental data obtained on a cyclic loading configuration test. Finally, the capabilities of the proposed model are demonstrated with a series of numerical simulations where complex cyclic and non-proportional loading conditions are applied as well as with a structural FE application.",['spi']
Adaptive multiscale moment method applied to the electromagnetic scattering by coastal breaking sea waves,"The adaptive multiscale moment method (AMMM) was originally developed to solve Fredholm equation. More recently, this method has demonstrated to be effective for scattering problems. In this article, we show that AMMM is a relevant approach to model and to analyze the electromagnetic scattering by coastal breaking sea waves. The shape of breaking wave results from very nonlinear fluid mechanics and is a complex target for electromagnetic scattering. This article presents an efficient hydrodynamic model and, combined with AMMM, a global realistic numerical simulation of the electromagnetic signature induced by breaking sea waves.",['spi']

EVALUATION OF CURVED ELECTRODE ACTUATOR DYNAMICS IN VISCOUS DIELECTRIC MEDIA FOR BIOMEMS APPLICATIONS,"This manuscript details the experimental analysis of a curved electrode actuator designed for mechanical manipulation of biological cells in a viscous, underwater environment. The actuator achieves large displacements (1-20 μm) and generates large forces (1-50 μN) at low actuation voltages (≤8 V) over 1-3000 Hz frequency range in viscous dielectric media, namely deionized water and methanol. Electrostatic actuators have the potential to physically probe biological cells [1]-[3]. Our previous static analysis of a curved electrode actuator showed that the actuator should be able to deform a cell with the appropriate force and deformation strain [1]. As a next step, we are investigating the dynamic response of these actuators in viscous media for high-throughput bioMEMS applications [4]. Our actuator comprises of three main components: a beam electrode, a set of four curved electrodes, and a reinforcing beam (Figure 1). The beam electrode and reinforcing beam together form the compliant clamped-clamped structure, while the curved electrodes are immovable and rigid. Upon energizing the actuator by supplying amplitude-modulated voltages VA and VB, the actuator shuttles back and forth in-plane. Here, the actuator operates in one of the three modes: nonzipped, partly zipped, and almost zipped. In the nonzipped mode, the beam electrode does not come in physical contact with the curved electrode and therefore the length of contact between the electrodes is zero. On the contrary, the length of contact between the electrodes is up to 75% of the beam electrode length for the partly zipped mode and at least 75% of the beam electrode length for almost zipped modes. In this study, we fabricate the actuator from a silicon-on-glass wafer using standard micromachining methods and characterize the actuator dynamics in deionized water and methanol in terms of actuator displacement at different voltage amplitudes of VA, VB ϵ [4, 8] V and actuation frequencies f ϵ [1, 4096] Hz using our test facility (Figure 2). The inverted microscope and high-speed camera are used for cinephotomicrography of the actuator, the NI PCIe-6343 DAQ card for triggering the camera, and a function generator for generating the actuation voltages VA and VB. We evaluate the actuator with the following criteria: peak-to-peak displacement (1-20 µm), force generation (1-50 µN), and operating frequency (1-3000 Hz). The actuator response in deionized water shows that the actuator achieves peak-to-peak displacements on the order of a cell diameter (20 µm) at 1 Hz actuation frequency for 8 V actuation voltage (Figure 3a). The actuator behaves like a linear and a nonlinear system for nonzipped and zipped operation modes, respectively. In the zipped operating mode (8 V) for an input sinusoidal forcing function on the actuator, higher harmonics f2n+1 in the actuator are excited-characteristic of a nonlinear system (Figure 3b). However, in the nonzipped mode (4 V), the higher harmonics vanish and the actuator behaves like a linear system. The dynamic performance of the actuator over the entire operating range in deionized water and methanol media is characterized by generating frequency response plots. For low actuation voltages (4 V), the actuator operates in nonzipped mode (Figure 4) with small peak-to-peak displacement amplitudes (< 8 µm). From Figure 4, we can make two observations. One, the zipping process in the actuator greatly enhances the actuator displacement, at least doubling the displacement. Two, the frequency bandwidth of the actuator depends predominantly on the operating mode or the actuation voltage. For instance, the actuator cutoff frequencies fc in deionized water for partly zipped (5 V) and almost zipped (8 V) modes are about 80 and 200 Hz, respectively. A similar observation can be made for the actuator in methanol media. From Figure 4a inset, the actuator response plots for both zipped (8 V) and nonzipped (4 V) operating modes show that the slope is about-20 dB/decade indicating that the actuator behaves like a first order system. This is expected as the actuator is overdamped due to the viscous microfluidic environment. As a part of our future work, we aim to integrate this curved electrode actuator into a microfluidic channel with a displacement sensor such that the sensor and actuator in tandem can compress biological cells and measure Young's modulus of cells at a rate of about 100 cells/s [4].",['spi']
Supporting A Flexible Grouping Mechanism for Collaborating Engineering Teams,"Most engineering tools do not provide much support for collaborating teams and today's engineering knowledge repositories lack flexibility and are limited. Engineering teams have different needs and their team members have different preferences on how and when to collaborate. These needs may depend on the individual work style, the role an engineer has, and the tasks they have to perform within the collaborating group. However, individual collaboration is insufficient and engineers need to collaborate in groups. This work presents a collaboration framework for collaborating groups capable of providing synchronous and asynchronous mode of collaboration. Additionally, our approach enables engineers to mix these collaboration modes to meet the preferences of individual group members. We evaluate the scalability of this framework using four real life large collaboration projects. These projects were found from GitHub and they were under active development by the time of evaluation. We have tested our approach creating groups of different sizes for each project. The results showed that our approach scales to support every case for the groups created. Additionally, we scouted the literature and discovered studies that support the usefulness of different groups with collaboration styles.",['info']

In particular, Ntrallazzu 4 was performed by Luzilei Aliel on the pífano and electric guitar in São João del Rei during the VIII UbiMus workshop. Aliel's particular setup also involved a further layer of processing: namely, the usage of Pure Data alongside Ableton Live in order to literally hijack the original piece and open a whole set of unforeseen possibilities that abundantly transcend the original intentions. In this paper, we signify our experience by means of the concept of comprovisation, while we situate Ntrallazzu 4 within the domain of ubiquitous music. Furthermore, we make use of the Heideggerian concept of Gelassenheit and of the Derridean concept of Metaphysics of Presence (as reformulated by Joseph Pugliese) in order to make sense of the piece.",['shs']

Distributing connectivity management in Cloud-Edge infrastructures : Challenges and approaches,"The classic approach of deploying large data centers to provide Cloud services is being challenged by the emerging needs of Internet of Things applications, Network Function Virtualization services or Mobile edge computing. A massively distributed Cloud-Edge architecture could better fit the requirements and constraints of these new trends by deploying on-demand Infrastructure as a Service in different locations of the Internet backbone (i.e, network point of presences). A key requirement in this context is the establishment of connectivity among several virtual infrastructure managers in charge of operating each site. In this paper, we analyze the requirements and challenges raised by the inter-site connectivity management in a Cloud-Edge infrastructure. We also aim at initiating the discussion about the research directions on this field providing some interesting points to promote future work.",['info']

A Data Stream Processing Optimisation Framework for Edge Computing Applications,"Data Stream Processing (DSP) is a widely used programming paradigm to process an unbounded event stream. Often, DSP frameworks are deployed on the cloud with a scalable resource model. One of the key requirements of DSP is to produce results with low latency. With the emergence of IoT, many event sources have been located outside the cloud which can result in higher end-to-end latency due to communication overhead. However, due to the abundance of resources at the IoT layer, Edge computing has emerged as a viable computational paradigm. In this paper, we devise an optimisation framework, consisting of a constraint satisfaction formulation and a system model, that aims to minimise end-to-end latency through appropriate placement of DSP operators either on cloud nodes or edge devices, i.e. deployed in an edge-cloud integrated environment. We test our optimisation framework using OMNeT++, with realistic topologies and power consumption data, and show that it is capable of achieving ≈ 1.65 times reduction of latency compared to edge-only and cloud-only placements, which in turn also reduces the energy consumption per event by up to ≈ 4% at the edge layer. To the best of our knowledge our optimisation framework is the first of its kind to integrate power, bandwidth and CPU constraints with latency minimisation.",['info']

Impact of microscopic heterogeneities of rock on elastic parameters in unconsolited sandstone reservoir,"The impact of microscopic rock heterogeneities on elastic properties in an unconsolidated sandstone reservoir in the Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt in Eastern Venezuela is studied at 3 wells using rock physics models. Differences in grain and pore sizes and the presence of shale/clay and cement, lead to differences in elastic properties values at same porosity. This allows to detect two different consolidation levels in the reservoir: (1) unconsolidated and (2) weakly consolidated due to cement and smaller grains/pores, where the first one has better rock quality. Being able to detect the two consolidation levels proves the interest of rock physics modelling in our case as tool to relate geology and seismic and to perform a quantitative seismic interpretation.",['sde']

Decentralized model predictive control for smooth coordination of automated vehicles at intersection,"We consider the problem of coordinating a set of automated vehicles at an intersection with no traffic light. The priority-based coordination framework is adopted to separate the problem into a priority assignment problem and a vehicle control problem under fixed priorities. This framework ensures good properties like safety (collision-free trajectories, brake-safe control) and liveness (no gridlock). We propose a decentralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach where vehicles solve local optimization problems in parallel, ensuring them to cross the intersection smoothly. The proposed decentralized MPC scheme considers the requirements of efficiency, comfort and fuel economy and ensures the smooth behaviors of vehicles. Moreover, it maintains the system-wide safety property of the priority-based framework. Simulations are performed to illustrate the benefits of our approach.","['scco', 'spi']"

A Hierarchical Model Predictive Control Framework for On-road Formation Control of Autonomous Vehicles,"This paper presents an approach for formation control of autonomous vehicles traversing along a multi-lane road with obstacles and traffic. A major challenge in this problem is a requirement for integrating individual vehicle behaviors such as lane-keeping and collision avoidance with a global formation maintenance behavior. We propose a hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach. The desired formation is modeled as a virtual structure evolving curvilinearly along a centerline, and vehicle configurations are expressed as curvilinear relative longitudinal and lateral offsets from the virtual center. At high-level, the trajectory generation of the virtual center is achieved through an MPC framework, which allows various on-road driving constraints to be considered in the optimization. At low-level, a local MPC controller computes the vehicle inputs in order to track the desired trajectory, taking into account more personalized driving constraints. High-fidelity simulations show that the proposed approach drives vehicles to the desired formation while retains some freedom for individual vehicle behaviors.","['scco', 'spi']"
The Physical Internet,"The Physical Internet is a new concept for the global organization of logistics networks. Discover what it is all about ! The performance of logistics networks has made a considerable leap in recent decades. With a development capacity and degree of competition that leave little influence to public corrective actions, it is engendering increasing environmental and societal damage. To avoid the impasse between sustained demand and unsustainable impacts, this work, which is underpinned by a novel stream of research (both in Europe and North America), puts forward a new concept for the global organization of logistics networks : the Physical Internet. Like the Digital Internet that conveys data, the concept is to connect and synchronize all logistics networks to create a collaborative and robust physical network of networks, capable of continually optimizing the shipment of ""encapsulated"" goods of many types and sizes : - in compliance with customer requirements : lead time, security and insurance, controlled temperature… - by optimizing both the operator’s and the customer's economic models ; - by minimizing the environmental footprint ; - by means of routing protocols, interoperability and traceability standards, remuneration rules, compensation mechanisms and new trade configurations. The book explores the Physical Internet in great detail, showing up its promise and its limitations. The book outlines the essential components, puts forward a framework for specification and analysis, and highlights the dimensions yet to be investigated. Above all, based on illustrative simulations, it confirms the major benefit of the Physical Internet, increasing the cost efficiency of logistics while decreasing its environmental impact - a rare combination.",['spi']

Flow modelling of quasi-Newtonian fluids in two-scale fibrous fabrics: Advanced simulations,"Permeability is the fundamental macroscopic material property needed to quantify the flow in a fibrous medium viewed as a porous medium. Composite processing models require the permeability as input data to predict flow patterns and pressure fields. In a previous work, the expressions of macroscopic permeability were derived in a double-scale porosity medium for both Newtonian and generalized Newtonian (shear-thinning) resins. In the linear case, only a microscopic calculation on a representative volume is required, implying as many microscopic calculations as there are representative microscopic volumes in the whole fibrous structure. In the non-linear case, and even when the porous microstructure can be described by a unique representative volume, a large number of microscopic calculations must be carried out as the microscale resin viscosity depends on the macroscopic velocity, which in turn depends on the permeability that results from a microscopic calculation. An original and efficient offline-online procedure was proposed for the solution of non-linear flow problems related to generalized Newtonian fluids in porous media. In this paper, this procedure is generalized to quasi-Newtonian fluids in order to evaluate the effect of extensional viscosity on the resulting upscaled permeability. This work constitutes a natural step forward in the definition of equivalent saturated permeabilities for linear and non-linear fluids.",['spi']
"Evaluation of Antibiogram, Genotype and Phylogenetic Analysis of Biofield Treated Nocardia otitidis","Nocardiosis is a soil-borne aerobic infection caused by Nocardia species commonly affects the respiratory tract. Nocardia otitidis (N. otitidis) is the key organism for non-mycobacterial tuberculosis. The current study was attempted to investigate the effect of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on N. otitidis and analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), DNA polymorphism by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and 16S rDNA sequencing. The strain of N. otitidis (ATCC 14630) was divided into two parts, control and treated. Antimicrobial susceptibility was studied using the broth microdilution technique. Overall, the MIC values of 16.67% antimicrobials were changed in the treated group of N. otitidis as compared to the control. Moreover, MIC value of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was reduced by two-fold (0.5/9.5 to 0.25/4.75 μg/mL) in the biofield energy treated sample as compared to the control without alteration in the sensitivity spectrum. The 16S rDNA analysis showed that the treated sample was detected as Enterobacter aerogenes strain NCTC10006T (GenBank Accession No: AJ251468) with 98% identity of gene sequencing data. However, the nearest homolog genus-species was found as Kluyvera cryocrescens (GenBank Accession No: AM184245). Using RAPD biomarkers, the sample showed an average range of 34 to 53% of polymorphism among treated samples as compared to the control. The 16S rDNA sequencing of treated sample was carried out to correlate the phylogenetic relationship of N. otitidis with other bacterial species. These results suggested that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment has a significant impact on N. otitidis.",['sdv']
Modeling laser drilling in percussion regime using constraint natural element method,"The laser drilling process is the main process used in machining procedures on aeronautic engines, espe- cially in the cooling parts. The industrial problematic is to reduce geometrical deviations of the holes and defects dur- ing manufacturing. The interaction between a laser beam and an absorbent metallic matter in the laser drilling regime involves thermal and hydrodynamical phenomenon. Their role on the drilling is not yet completely understood and a realistic simulation of the process could contribute to a better understanding of these phenomenon. The simula- tion of such process induces strong numerical difficulties. This work presents a physical model combined with the use of the original Constraint Natural Element Method to simulate the laser drilling. The physical model includes solid/liquid and liquid/vapor phase transformations, the liq- uid ejection and the convective and conductive thermal exchanges. It is the first time that all these phenomena are included in a modelling and numerically solved in a 2D axisymmmetric problem. Simulations results predict most of measurements (hole geometry, velocity of the liquid ejection and laser drilling velocity) without adjusting any parameters.","['info', 'spi']"
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Pattern and Biochemical Characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus: Impact of Bio field Treatment,"Study background: Staphylococci are widespread in nature, mainly found on the skin and mucous membranes. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the key organism for food poisoning due to massive production of heat stable exotoxins. The current study was attempted to investigate the effect of biofield treatment on antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and biochemical characteristics of S. aureus (ATCC 25923). Methods: S. aureus cells were procured from MicroBioLogics in sealed packs bearing the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 25923) number and stored according to the recommended storage protocols until needed for experiments. Revived and lyophilized state of ATCC strains of S. aureus were selected for the study. Both revived (Group; Gr. II) and lyophilized (Gr. III) strain of S. aureus were subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Revived treated cells were assessed on day 5 and day 10 while lyophilized treated cells on day 10 only. After biofield treatment both treated cells were analysed for its antimicrobial sensitivity, minimum inhibitory concentration value, biochemical reactions and biotype number with respect to control (Gr. I). Results: The antimicrobial susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration of S. aureus showed significant (86.67%) alteration in lyophilized cells while no alteration was found in revived treated cells as compared to control. It was observed that overall 37.93% (eleven out of twenty nine) biochemical reactions were altered in the treated groups with respect to control. Moreover, biotype numbers were substantially changed in revived treated cells, Gr. II (303137, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. ureolyticus) on day 5 and in lyophilized treated cells, Gr. III (767177, S. cohnii subsp. urealyticum) on day 10 as compared to control (307016, S. aureus). Conclusion: The result suggested that biofield treatment has significant impact on S. aureus in lyophilized treated cells with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility, MIC values and biochemical reactions pattern. Apart from these, biotype numbers with new species were observed in revived treated group on day 5 as Staphylococcus capitis subsp. ureolyticus and in lyophilized cells as Staphylococcus cohnii subsp. urealyticum with respect to control, i.e., S.

Pancreatic Cancer Surgical Resection Margins: Molecular Assessment by Mass Spectrometry Imaging,"BackgroundSurgical resection with microscopically negative margins remains the main curative option for pancreatic cancer; however, in practice intraoperative delineation of resection margins is challenging. Ambient mass spectrometry imaging has emerged as a powerful technique for chemical imaging and real-time diagnosis of tissue samples. We applied an approach combining desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) statistical method to diagnose pancreatic tissue sections and prospectively evaluate surgical resection margins from pancreatic cancer surgery.Methods and FindingsOur methodology was developed and tested using 63 banked pancreatic cancer samples and 65 samples (tumor and specimen margins) collected prospectively during 32 pancreatectomies from February 27, 2013, to January 16, 2015. In total, mass spectra for 254,235 individual pixels were evaluated. When cross-validation was employed in the training set of samples, 98.1% agreement with histopathology was obtained. Using an independent set of samples, 98.6% agreement was achieved. We used a statistical approach to evaluate 177,727 mass spectra from samples with complex, mixed histology, achieving an agreement of 81%. The developed method showed agreement with frozen section evaluation of specimen margins in 24 of 32 surgical cases prospectively evaluated. In the remaining eight patients, margins were found to be positive by DESI-MSI/Lasso, but negative by frozen section analysis. The median overall survival after resection was only 10 mo for these eight patients as opposed to 26 mo for patients with negative margins by both techniques. This observation suggests that our method (as opposed to the standard method to date) was able to detect tumor involvement at the margin in patients who developed early recurrence. Nonetheless, a larger cohort of samples is needed to validate the findings described in this study. Careful evaluation of the long-term benefits to patients of the use of DESI-MSI for surgical margin evaluation is also needed to determine its value in clinical practice.ConclusionsOur findings provide evidence that the molecular information obtained by DESI-MSI/Lasso from pancreatic tissue samples has the potential to transform the evaluation of surgical specimens. With further development, we believe the described methodology could be routinely used for intraoperative surgical margin assessment of pancreatic cancer.",['sdv']
A systemic methodology to characterize peri-urban agriculture for a better integration of agricultural stakes in urban plan,"Community concerns about peri-urban agriculture legitimate its protection in planning.

Consider on the one hand New York, US, a city of 8,405,837 inhabitants covering 784km2, with dwellings concentrated into skyscrapers to protect inhabitants against floods; on the other hand, London, UK, has the same population size but double the area (1,572km2), as the result of very fast, low-density growth, which has gobbled up lot of farmland and natural areas. In this article, we’ll focus on two urban areas: Avignon in France and Constantine in Algeria. Our aim will be to analyse the similarities and differences between these two regions. Avignon has strong urbanisation of the peri-urban area, with scattered isolated houses. The middle and upper classes have settled down in the city surroundings, looking for the quality of life of the countryside (sun, calm, proximity to nature) while keeping the advantages of reasonable costs while close to the city-centre and working areas. This development option was authorised by public policies and regulations. Constantine also has great scatter development. In 2000, to manage this chaotic development, public stakeholders decided to create the city of Ali-Menjeli over 1,500ha to the south of Constantine. This new city is expected to eradicate Constantine’s shantytowns, with urban development concentrated in this new city. Avignon and Constantine have the same type of urban sprawl but a different geography and history, and particular constraints: floods for Avignon in 1856 and 2003, and an earthquake in Constantine in 1985. We will quantify urban progression for both of them over the past 30 years using remote sensing analysis of Landsat images to spatially represent and estimate land use changes. We will then analyse fragmentation using landscape indicators.","['sde', 'shs']"
Recent marine deposits reconstruction of two depositional environments of the French Atlantic coast,"This work provides a 300-yr high-resolution record of past storm and/or tsunami events using a multi-proxy analysis (137Cs and 210Pb dating, chemical composition and grain size) of sedimentary deposits from two coastal depositional environments of the French Atlantic coast. We analyse two wetland areas situated just behind a narrow coastal sand strip: 1) the Mer Blanche and 2) the Turballe. Evidence for strong extratropical storms and /or tsunamis events can be identified in this central part of the Bay of Biscay from the XIXth to the XXth century. Nine short sediment cores were collected in August 2016 using gravity type corer of 10 inner diameter and 100 cm length. Each core was longitudinally sliced, each half section photographed and described. High-resolution elemental analyses of split sediment cores were done using an Avaatech XRF core scanner. Then sediment cores were sampled every 0.5 cm. Grain size analysis was done using a Malvern 2600 laser beam grain sizer; organic carbon was measured by Leco induction furnace. 137Cs, 210Pb and 226Ra activities were measured on about 2 g dried sediment using a low background, well-type micro- spectrometer (Canberra). The 210Pb in excess, which is used for dating, was calculated as the difference of measured 210Pb and of its supported activities (226Ra). The history information is performed using historical documents including narrative sources, ancient maps, records of cities repairs, surveys conducted after a disaster, newspaper from different departmental and national archives, and meteorological data. Coastal depositional environments were affected hardest by extreme environmental and climatological events during the last century. In the Mer Blanche core, three extreme episodes can be observed: i) at 36 cm, sediment is characterized by coarser sand and higher Sr/Al ratio, this episode coincides with a high tidal wave in spring 1937; ii) at 55 cm, we observe the presence of many gravels, they dates back to the high tidal wave of 1924 and iii) at 65 cm, the presence of another coarse pebble layer is attributed to a series of severe storms associated with coastal flooding episodes between 1910 and 1913.","['shs', 'sde', 'phys']"
Laboratory hyperspectral imaging a powerful tool for a fast-high-resolution analysis of natural sample: application to sediment core,"The aim of this presentation is to overview some applications of hyperspectral imaging for sediment core analysis in paleo-environmental studies. The increase of the sensibility and the resolution of sensors, as well as the development of performant data processing methods allow the analyze of natural sample in a very informative (chemical, physical and biological) and time effective way. Hyperspectral imaging is a method at the interface of spectroscopy and imaging where a spectrum is obtained for each pixel in the sample image. In laboratory conditions, many spectroscopic range can use this kind of method, from the X-ray to the infrared, also fluorescence and Raman. The dataset obtains is called a datacube due to his three dimensions (two spatials and one spectral), a fourth temporal dimension can be added. For that, both methods of image processing and spectral processing methods (chemometrics) can be used independently or together to improve sample knowledge. Quantitative modelling allows to establish a relationship between the spectra and destructive analysis (Particle Size Distribution, RockEval). These supervised models can then theoretically use on other samples without any sampling. Known structures can be discriminating accurately with classification methods, for example lamina or floods, with the labeling of some pixels to a known group. Unknown ones defined by chemical, physical or biological compounds can be determinates with similar methods and then explained by environment hypothesis. For these chemometrics methods, discriminant spectral wavelengths are identified and therefore sediment properties (chemical, physical or biological). Image processing of the core image or of the quantitative or qualitative map can be used to reveal surface structures (instant event, lamina) or local anomalies (coal, grain). The image resolution allows to see structures that the eye cannot see precisely, as infra-millimeter lamina. The use of spectro-spatial methods together and a time model allow to have a chronicle of structural sediment compositions and events. In this study, we use visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging (pixel sizes: 60 and 240 micrometers) and X-Ray Fluorescence spectroscopy (240 micrometer) to analyze the lake Le Bourget sediment core (Savoie, France). Quantitative prediction models have been made for LOI550, Particle Size Distribution and fractions, some RockEval variables with correlation coefficients of the model upper than 0.8 and consistent uncertainties. Lamination counting was also realized with spectral classification methods and image processing, and this is in agreement with eye counting. With these two methods, seasonal variations can be separated in the eutrophic part of the core and compare. Hyperspectral imaging can also be used to find the optimal sampling areas for routine destructive analysis and to create predictive models. The use of several sensors, with data fusion methods, has shown that the increase of the amount of spectro-chemical information allowed to improve the robustness of predictive models. Hyperspectral imaging present already many possibilities to improve our knowledge on natural sample.",['sde']
Zinc complex based photoinitiating systems for acrylate polymerization under air; in situ formation of Zn-based fillers and composites,"[N,N′-Bis(salicylidene)-1,2-phenylenediamine]zinc(II) (ZnC) exhibits unexpected properties as a photoinitiator or additive for both free-radical photopolymerization reactions and in situ formation of Zn-based fillers under light activation and aerated conditions. The ZnC/2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA) and ZnC/N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) couples are characterized by remarkable properties: (i) a photoinitiating efficiency for the radical polymerization of an acrylate matrix under air higher than that of a reference Type I photoinitiator such as DMPA (final conversion of ∼30–45% vs. 15%) and therefore a good ability to overcome the oxygen inhibition effect and (ii) a never reported in situ formation of Zn-based fillers (100 μm thick sticks) or composites. The photochemical properties of the ZnC are investigated by fluorescence and UV-visible spectroscopy and Electron Spin Resonance (ESR). The photodecomposition of ZnC under air is governed by either an addition of peroxyl radicals onto ZnC when associated with DMPA, or a H-abstraction mechanism when combined with MDEA. When using a ZnC/MDEA/silver salt photoinitiating system, a highly efficient polymerization of the acrylate matrix under air and a concomitant in situ production of Ag(0) NPs are observed.",['chim']
Sphaerodactyls endemic to South Eastern of Martinique and geological history of the Eastern CaribbeanSphaerodactyls المستوطنة في جنوب شرق المارتينيك والتاريخ الجيولوجي لشرق البحر الكاريبيSphaerodactyls endemisch im Südosten von Martinique und geologische Geschichte der östlichen KaribikEsfaerodactilos endémicos del sureste de Martinica e historia geológica del Caribe orientalSphaérodactyles endémiques du sud-est de la Martinique et histoire géologique de la Caraïbe orientale马提尼克岛东南部特有的球形触须和东加勒比海的地质历史,"In 2013 during preliminary work for the ABC (Atlas of the Biodiversity Communal) of Sainte Anne, a very particular phenotype of Sphaerodactylus was observed present around and on the limest one Dulls of the peninsula of the southeastern Martinique; similarly during the IBR (Rapid Biological Inventory), still in 2013 at the initiative of the city of Lamentin in partnership with Cuban scientists from BIOECO in Santiago de Cuba, a particular mor photype was spotted on the islands o f the Bay of Génipa and Cohé of Lamentin. Working for the Atlas of amphibians and reptiles of Martinique initiated by the PNRM (Regional Natural Park of Martinique) for many years, Dr. Michel Breuil reported the intriguing presence of spherodactyls with scapular ocelli (such as spherodactyls north of Martinique), yet located in the South East on the Vauclin Mountain In 2013 Groba & Thorpe's work in molecular biology carried first important data allowing to identify the existence of two Sphaerodactyl species for Martinique going back to the d ate of their divergence 12 My, and without integrating the data concerning the species of sphaerodactyls present in St. Lucia. It was not until 2015 that we became aware of additional data with the published work of Hedges et al. al., allowing to integrate in our analysis sphaerodactyls present in Saint Lucia, and generally throughout the Caribbean to establish their phylogeny. These molecular biological data from Hedges are essential to establish our initial findings regarding our spherodactyl phenotypic data observed in 2013 at the St. Anne Peninsula and the IBR on Genipa, Ducos and Lamentin Bay. They allow us to test our hypothesis of demonstration of a third line in Martinique of sphaerodactyls represented by our S. X sp. in southeastern Martinique, distinct from the two lineages that generated S. vincenti in the southwest, and S. festus in northern Martinique. Geological history and geoscience are crucial to understanding the overall evolution of biodiversity. The herpetofauna of the islands of the Eastern Caribbean and especially small amphibians and squamates living in ecological Caribbean and especially small amphibians and squamates living in ecological niches on soils requiring litter, are then among the first occupants of emerged niches on soils requiring litter, are then among the first occupants of emerged land surfaces. And so the geological evolution land surfaces - tectonic and volcanic tectonic and volcanic - of Martinique and the Caribbean archipelago is determining for the process of dispersions and thus of speciations of this herpetofauna originating from the zone of the current basin of the Orinoco. With advances in genetics, research in molecular systematics makes species of this micro herpetofauna in particular indicators allowing revelation and accuracy of dating phenomena and geological events. Phylogeny of a herpetofauna, and especially of Sphaerodactyls, which proves to be indicative of a geological history of the Eastern Carib proves to be indicative of a geological history of the Eastern Caribbean where bean where Martinique stands out as exceptional and central on the scale of this Grenadian basin where it is located; playing a main role of refuge island from basin where it is located, then -38 My, dispersal center from - 31 My, and - 12 My for Sphaerodactyls. A proto--Martinique Martinique island refuge in this almost unique Grenadian basin (with proto--Barbados) maintained not submerged from - 25 My, which was quite naturally dispersal center, first of all towards proto-Saint Lucia in the geological phase of reof re--emergence around -31 My. The research in herpetology and especially the first results of work in molecular systematics of 2013, then of 2015 relating to this Martinique herpetofauna jostle the geosciences and force a revision of the historical scenario of the formation and the geological evolution of the Caribbean's tectonics Oriental with land masses (forming an isthmus since the Eocene, well over - 45 My), then almost all submerged to -25 My. This isthmus at the top of a cordillera, located on the southeastern edge of the so-called lithospheric film The Caribbean Plate, at the junction of the three lithospheric films, Caribbean, North America and South America, has formed a bridge between the Orinoco basin and the Bank of Puerto Rico, and the islands of the proto-Greater Antilles. The history of biological endemism in the surface of emerged lands does not begin there, therefore, only in the Miocene at ""- 24 My"" as it is generally admitted.في عام 2013 أثناء العمل التمهيدي لـ ABC (أطلس لجنة التنوع البيولوجي) في Sainte Anne ، لوحظ وجود نمط ظاهري خاص جدًا من Sphaerodactylus موجود حول وحول Dulls واحدة Dulls في شبه جزيرة المارتينيك الجنوبية الشرقية ؛ وبالمثل خلال IBR (الجرد البيولوجي السريع) ، الذي لا يزال في عام 2013 بمبادرة من مدينة Lamentin بالشراكة مع العلماء الكوبيين من BIOECO في سانتياغو دي كوبا ، تم اكتشاف صورة مور خاصة على جزر خليج غنيبا وكوهي من آمنتين. أثناء عمله لأطلس البرمائيات والزواحف في جزر المارتينيك التي بدأتها PNRM (الحديقة الطبيعية الإقليمية في المارتينيك) لسنوات عديدة ، أبلغ الدكتور ميشيل برويل عن الوجود المثير للسبيروداكتيلات مع السبيل أوكيليلي (مثل spherodactyls شمال المارتينيك) ، ولكن يقع في الجنوب الشرقي على جبل فوكلين في عام 2013 ، حمل عمل جروبا أند ثورب في البيولوجيا الجزيئية أول البيانات المهمة التي تسمح بتحديد وجود نوعين من سبيروداكتيل لمارتينيك يعودان إلى تناول اختلافهما 12 ماي ، وبدون دمج البيانات المتعلقة أنواع sphaerodactyls موجودة في سانت لوسيا. لم يكن حتى عام 2015 أننا أصبحنا على بينة من البيانات الإضافية مع الأعمال المنشورة لـ Hedges et al. السماح للاندماج في تحليلنا sphaerodactyls الموجودة في سانت لوسيا ، وعموما في جميع أنحاء منطقة البحر الكاريبي لتأسيس نسالة لها. هذه البيانات البيولوجية الجزيئية من Hedges ضرورية لتأسيس نتائجنا الأولية فيما يتعلق ببياناتنا المظهرية للسبيروداكتيل التي لوحظت في عام 2013 في شبه جزيرة سانت آن و IBR في Genipa و Ducos و Lamentin Bay. إنها تسمح لنا باختبار فرضيتنا المتمثلة في عرض الخط الثالث في المارتينيك من sphaerodactyls ممثلة بـ S. X sp. في جنوب شرق المارتينيك ، تختلف عن اثنين من السلالات التي ولدت S. vincenti في الجنوب الغربي ، و S. festus في شمال المارتينيك. إن التاريخ الجيولوجي وعلوم الأرض أمران ضروريان لفهم التطور الشامل للتنوع البيولوجي. و herpetofauna من جزر الشرقية منطقة البحر الكاريبي ، وخاصة البرمائيات والحشائش الصغيرة التي تعيش في البيئة ، منطقة البحر الكاريبي ، وخاصة البرمائيات والحشائش الصغيرة التي تعيش في منافذ بيئية على التربة التي تتطلب القمامة ، هي من بين أول شاغلي المنافذ التي ظهرت على التربة التي تحتاج إلى نفايات . وهكذا فإن التطور الجيولوجي لأسطح اليابسة - التكتونية والبركانية والبركانية - لأرخبيل المارتينيك والكاريبي يحدد عملية التشتت وبالتالي تحديدات هذه الزاحبة الفطرية الناشئة من منطقة الحوض الحالي لأورينوكو. مع التقدم في علم الوراثة ، يجعل البحث في علم اللاهوت الجزيئي أنواعًا من هذه الهيربتوفونا الصغيرة وخاصةً المؤشرات التي تسمح بالكشف عن ودقة ظواهر المواعدة والأحداث الجيولوجية. يثبت أن السلالة النباتية للهروبوفونا ، وخاصة سبيروداكتيلز ، والتي تثبت دلالة على التاريخ الجيولوجي لمنطقة كاريب الشرقية ، تدل على وجود تاريخ جيولوجي لمنطقة شرق البحر الكاريبي حيث تبرز الحبة حيث تتميز المارتينيك على أنها استثنائية ومحورية في هذا حوض غرينادين حيث يقع ؛ لعب دورًا رئيسيًا في جزيرة الملاذ من الحوض الذي يقع فيه ، ثم -38 مركز التشتيت الخاص بي - 31 My و - 12 My for Sphaerodactyls. محمية من جزيرة مارتينيك مارتينيك في هذا الحوض الغرينادي الفريد تقريبًا (مع بروتو - بربادوس) لم يتم غمرها من - 25 ماي ، الذي كان مركزًا طبيعيًا للتشتت ، أولاً وقبل كل شيء باتجاه بروتو سانت لوسيا في المرحلة الجيولوجية من ريف إعادة ظهور حول -31 بلدي. إن البحث في علم الزواحف وخاصة النتائج الأولى للعمل في علم اللاهوت الجزيئي لعام 2013 ، ثم لعام 2015 المتعلقة بهذا المارتينيك herpetofauna ، التي تدور حول علوم الأرض ، وتفرض مراجعة السيناريو التاريخي للتكوين والتطور الجيولوجي لتكتونيات البحر الكاريبي الشرقية بالأرض الكتل (تشكل برزخًا منذ العصر الأيوسيني ، يزيد كثيرًا عن 45 عامًا) ، ثم غمرت جميعها تقريبًا إلى -25 ماي. شكل هذا البرزخ في الجزء العلوي من كورديليرا ، الواقع على الحافة الجنوبية الشرقية لما يسمى بفيلم ليثوسفيري ""ذا كاريبيان بلايت"" ، عند ملتقى أفلام ليثوسفير الثلاثة ، الكاريبي وأمريكا الشمالية وأمريكا الجنوبية ، جسرًا بين حوض أورينوكو وبنك بورتوريكو ، وجزر جزر الأنتيل الكبرى. لا يبدأ تاريخ الاستيطان البيولوجي في سطح الأراضي الناشئة هناك ، لذلك ، فقط في الميوسين في ""- 24 My"" كما هو مقبول بشكل عام.Im Jahr 2013 wurde während der Vorarbeiten für das ABC (Atlas of the Biodiversity Communal) von Sainte Anne ein ganz besonderer Phänotyp von Sphaerodactylus beobachtet, der um und auf dem kalkreichsten Dulls der Halbinsel im Südosten von Martinique vorhanden war. In ähnlicher Weise wurde während des IBR (Rapid Biological Inventory), noch 2013 auf Initiative der Stadt Lamentin in Zusammenarbeit mit kubanischen Wissenschaftlern von BIOECO in Santiago de Cuba, auf den Inseln der Bucht von Génipa und Cohé von ein besonderer Mor-Fototyp entdeckt Lamentin. Dr. Michel Breuil arbeitete jahrelang für den Atlas der Amphibien und Reptilien von Martinique, der vom PNRM (Regionaler Naturpark von Martinique) initiiert wurde, und berichtete über das faszinierende Vorhandensein von Sphärodaktylen mit Skapulagellen (wie Sphärodaktylen nördlich von Martinique) Der Südosten auf dem Vauclin-Berg Im Jahr 2013 lieferte Groba & Thorpes Arbeit in der Molekularbiologie erste wichtige Daten, die es ermöglichten, die Existenz von zwei Sphaerodactyl-Arten für Martinique zu identifizieren, die auf das Datum ihrer Divergenz zurückgehen 12 My, und ohne die Daten zu integrieren Arten von Sphaerodactyls in St. Lucia vorhanden. Erst 2015 wurden wir mit der veröffentlichten Arbeit von Hedges et al. Auf zusätzliche Daten aufmerksam. Dies ermöglicht die Integration von Sphaerodactylen in St. Lucia und allgemein in der Karibik in unsere Analyse, um deren Phylogenie festzustellen. Diese molekularbiologischen Daten von Hedges sind wichtig, um unsere ersten Ergebnisse in Bezug auf unsere 2013 auf der St. Anne Peninsula und der IBR in Genipa, Ducos und Lamentin Bay beobachteten phänotypischen Sphärodaktylusdaten zu ermitteln. Sie ermöglichen es uns, unsere Hypothese des Nachweises einer dritten Linie von Sphaerodactylen in Martinique zu testen, die durch unsere S. X sp. im Südosten von Martinique, im Unterschied zu den beiden Linien, aus denen S. vincenti im Südwesten und S. festus im Norden von Martinique hervorgingen. Geologische Geschichte und Geowissenschaften sind entscheidend für das Verständnis der allgemeinen Entwicklung der biologischen Vielfalt. Die Herpetofauna der Inseln des Ostens Karibische und besonders kleine Amphibien und Squamate, die in der ökologischen Karibik leben, und insbesondere kleine Amphibien und Squamate, die in ökologischen Nischen auf Böden leben, die Abfall benötigen, gehören dann zu den ersten Bewohnern von entstandenen Nischen auf Böden, die Müll benötigen, und gehören dann zu den ersten Bewohnern von aufgetauchten Landoberflächen . Und so bestimmen die geologischen Entwicklungslandoberflächen - tektonisch und vulkanisch tektonisch und vulkanisch - von Martinique und dem karibischen Archipel den Prozess der Ausbreitung und damit der Speziation dieser Herpetofauna, die aus der Zone des gegenwärtigen Orinoco-Beckens stammt. Mit den Fortschritten in der Genetik macht die Forschung in der molekularen Systematik Arten dieser Mikroherpetofauna zu besonderen Indikatoren, die die Aufdeckung und Genauigkeit von Datierungsphänomenen und geologischen Ereignissen ermöglichen. Die Phylogenie einer Herpetofauna und insbesondere von Sphaerodactyls, die sich als Hinweis auf eine geologische Geschichte der östlichen Karibik erweist, weist auf eine geologische Geschichte der östlichen Karibik hin, in der Bohnen, in denen Martinique als außergewöhnlich und zentral in diesem Ausmaß hervorsticht Grenadisches Becken, in dem es sich befindet; spielt eine Hauptrolle der Zufluchtsinsel aus dem Becken, in dem sie sich befindet, dann -38 My, Ausbreitungszentrum von - 31 My und - 12 My für Sphaerodactyls. Ein Proto-Martinique-Martinique-Insel-Zufluchtsort in diesem fast einzigartigen grenadischen Becken (mit Proto-Barbados), das nicht untergetaucht ist von - 25 My, einem ganz natürlichen Ausbreitungszentrum, zunächst in Richtung Proto-St. Lucia in der geologischen Phase des Reofs Wiederauftauchen um -31 My. Die Forschung in der Herpetologie und insbesondere die ersten Ergebnisse der Arbeiten in der molekularen Systematik von 2013, dann von 2015, die sich auf diese Martinique-Herpetofauna beziehen, drängen die Geowissenschaften und erzwingen eine Überarbeitung des historischen Szenarios der Entstehung und geologischen Entwicklung der orientalischen Tektonik der Karibik mit Land Massen (die seit dem Eozän eine Landenge bilden, weit über - 45 My), dann fast alle unter -25 My. Diese Landenge an der Spitze einer Kordillere am südöstlichen Rand des sogenannten lithosphärischen Films The Caribbean Plate, an der Kreuzung der drei lithosphärischen Filme Karibik, Nordamerika und Südamerika, hat eine Brücke zwischen dem Orinoco-Becken gebildet und die Bank von Puerto Rico und die Inseln der proto-größeren Antillen. Die Geschichte des biologischen Endemismus in der Oberfläche von Schwellenländern beginnt dort nicht, sondern nur im Miozän bei ""- 24 My"", wie allgemein anerkannt wird.En 2013, durante el trabajo preliminar para el ABC (Atlas de la Biodiversidad Comunal) de Sainte Anne, se observó un fenotipo muy particular de Sphaerodactylus presente alrededor y en el más opaco Dulls de la península del sudeste de Martinica; Del mismo modo, durante el IBR (Inventario biológico rápido), aún en 2013 por iniciativa de la ciudad de Lamentin en colaboración con científicos cubanos de BIOECO en Santiago de Cuba, se detectó un fototipo particular en las islas de la Bahía de Génipa y Cohé de Lamentin Trabajando para el Atlas de anfibios y reptiles de Martinica iniciado por el PNRM (Parque Natural Regional de Martinica) durante muchos años, el Dr. Michel Breuil informó sobre la intrigante presencia de esferodactilos con ocelos escapulares (como los esferodactilos al norte de Martinica), pero ubicados en el Sureste en la montaña Vauclin En 2013, el trabajo de Groba & Thorpe en biología molecular aportó los primeros datos importantes que permitieron identificar la existencia de dos especies de Sphaerodactyl para Martinica, volviendo a la fecha de su divergencia 12 My, y sin integrar los datos relativos a la especies de esfaerodactilos presentes en Santa Lucía. No fue sino hasta 2015 que nos dimos cuenta de datos adicionales con el trabajo publicado de Hedges et al. al., permitiendo integrar en nuestro análisis los esfaerodactilos presentes en Santa Lucía, y en general en todo el Caribe para establecer su filogenia. Estos datos biológicos moleculares de Hedges son esenciales para establecer nuestros hallazgos iniciales con respecto a nuestros datos fenotípicos de esferodactilo observados en 2013 en la Península de St. Anne y el IBR en Genipa, Ducos y Lamentin Bay. Nos permiten probar nuestra hipótesis de demostración de una tercera línea en Martinica de esfaerodactilos representados por nuestro S. X sp. en el sureste de Martinica, distinto de los dos linajes que generaron S. vincenti en el suroeste y S. festus en el norte de Martinica. La historia geológica y la geociencia son cruciales para comprender la evolución general de la biodiversidad. La herpetofauna de las islas del este El caribe y especialmente los pequeños anfibios y cuadrados que viven en el Caribe ecológico y especialmente los pequeños anfibios y los cuadrados que viven en nichos ecológicos en suelos que requieren basura, se encuentran entre los primeros ocupantes de nichos emergidos en suelos que requieren basura, luego se encuentran entre los primeros ocupantes de superficies de tierra emergidas . Y así, la evolución geológica de las superficies terrestres - tectónica y volcánica tectónica y volcánica - de Martinica y el archipiélago del Caribe es determinante para el proceso de dispersiones y, por lo tanto, de las especiaciones de esta herpetofauna que se origina en la zona de la cuenca actual del Orinoco. Con los avances en genética, la investigación en sistemática molecular convierte a las especies de esta micro herpetofauna en indicadores particulares que permiten la revelación y precisión de fenómenos de datación y eventos geológicos. La filogenia de una herpetofauna, y especialmente de Sphaerodactyls, que prueba ser indicativa de una historia geológica del caribe oriental, es indicativa de una historia geológica del Caribe Oriental donde el frijol donde Martinica se destaca como excepcional y central en la escala de este Cuenca granadina donde se encuentra; desempeñando un papel principal de la isla de refugio de la cuenca donde se encuentra, luego -38 My, centro de dispersión de - 31 My, y - 12 My para Sphaerodactyls. Un refugio de la isla proto - Martinica Martinica en esta cuenca granadina casi única (con proto - Barbados) mantenida no sumergida desde - 25 My, que era un centro de dispersión bastante natural, en primer lugar hacia proto-Santa Lucía en la fase geológica de reof resurgir alrededor de -31 My. La investigación en herpetología y especialmente los primeros resultados del trabajo en sistemática molecular de 2013, luego de 2015 relacionados con esta herpetofauna de Martinica empujan las geociencias y fuerzan una revisión del escenario histórico de la formación y la evolución geológica de la tectónica oriental del Caribe con tierra masas (formando un istmo desde el Eoceno, más de - 45 Mi), luego casi todas sumergidas a -25 Mi. Este istmo en la cima de una cordillera, ubicada en el extremo sureste de la llamada película litosférica The Caribbean Plate, en la unión de las tres películas litosféricas, el Caribe, América del Norte y América del Sur, ha formado un puente entre la cuenca del Orinoco y el Banco de Puerto Rico, y las islas de las proto-Antillas Mayores. La historia del endemismo biológico en la superficie de las tierras emergidas no comienza allí, por lo tanto, solo en el Mioceno en ""- 24 My"", como generalmente se admite.En 2013 lors des travaux préliminaires pour l'ABC (Atlas de la Biodiversité Communale) de Sainte Anne, un phénotype très particulier de Sphaerodactylus a été observé présent autour et sur le plus tendre Dulls de la presqu'île de la Martinique sud-est; de même lors de l'IBR (Rapid Biological Inventory), toujours en 2013 à l'initiative de la ville de Lamentin en partenariat avec des scientifiques cubains du BIOECO à Santiago de Cuba, un photype particulier a été repéré sur les îles de la baie de Génipa et de la Cohé de Lamentin. Travaillant pour l'Atlas des amphibiens et reptiles de Martinique initié par le PNRM (Parc Naturel Régional de Martinique) depuis de nombreuses années, le Dr Michel Breuil a rapporté la présence intrigante de sphérodactyles à ocelles scapulaires (tels que les sphérodactyles au nord de la Martinique), pourtant située le Sud-Est sur la Montagne Vauclin En 2013, les travaux de Groba & Thorpe en biologie moléculaire ont porté des premières données importantes permettant d'identifier l'existence de deux espèces de Sphaerodactyl pour la Martinique remontant au jour de leur divergence 12 My, et sans intégrer les données concernant la espèces de sphaérodactyles présentes à Sainte-Lucie. Ce n'est qu'en 2015 que nous avons pris connaissance de données supplémentaires avec les travaux publiés de Hedges et al. al., permettant d'intégrer dans notre analyse des sphaérodactyles présents à Sainte-Lucie, et généralement dans toute la Caraïbe pour établir leur phylogénie. Ces données biologiques moléculaires de Hedges sont essentielles pour établir nos premières conclusions concernant nos données phénotypiques de sphérodactyle observées en 2013 dans la péninsule Sainte-Anne et l'IBR à Genipa, Ducos et Lamentin Bay. Ils nous permettent de tester notre hypothèse de démonstration d'une troisième lignée en Martinique de sphaérodactyles représentés par notre S. X sp. dans le sud-est de la Martinique, distincte des deux lignées qui ont engendré S. vincenti dans le sud-ouest et S. festus dans le nord de la Martinique. L'histoire géologique et les géosciences sont essentielles pour comprendre l'évolution globale de la biodiversité. L'herpétofaune des îles de l'Est Les Caraïbes et en particulier les petits amphibiens et les squamates vivant dans les Caraïbes écologiques et en particulier les petits amphibiens et les squamates vivant dans des niches écologiques sur des sols nécessitant de la litière, sont alors parmi les premiers occupants des niches émergées sur des sols nécessitant des déchets, sont alors parmi les premiers occupants des surfaces émergées . Et donc l'évolution géologique des surfaces terrestres - tectoniques et volcaniques tectoniques et volcaniques - de la Martinique et de l'archipel des Caraïbes est déterminante pour le processus de dispersions et donc de spéciations de cette herpétofaune originaire de la zone du bassin actuel de l'Orénoque. Avec les avancées de la génétique, la recherche en systématique moléculaire fait des espèces de cette micro-herpétofaune notamment des indicateurs permettant la révélation et la précision des phénomènes de datation et des événements géologiques. La phylogénie d'une herpétofaune, et notamment des sphaérodactyles, qui se révèle être révélatrice d'une histoire géologique des Caraïbes orientales se révèle être révélatrice d'une histoire géologique des Caraïbes orientales où le haricot où la Martinique se démarque comme exceptionnel et central à l'échelle de cette Bassin grenadien où il se trouve; jouant un rôle principal d'île refuge du bassin où il se trouve, puis de -38 My, centre de dispersion de - 31 My, et - 12 My pour les sphaérodactyles. Un proto - Martinique Martinique refuge insulaire dans ce bassin grenadien quasi unique (avec proto - Barbade) maintenu non submergé de - 25 My, qui fut tout naturellement centre de dispersion, tout d'abord vers proto-Sainte-Lucie dans la phase géologique de reof réémergence vers -31 Ma. Les recherches en herpétologie et surtout les premiers résultats de travaux en systématique moléculaire de 2013, puis de 2015 relatifs à cette herpétofaune martiniquaise bousculent les géosciences et forcent une révision du scénario historique de la formation et de l'évolution géologique de la tectonique caribéenne orientale à terre (formant un isthme depuis l'Éocène, bien au-dessus de - 45 My), puis presque toutes submergées à -25 My.

Mind Style and Characterization in John McGahern's The Dark,"The aim of this paper is to offer an in-depth analysis of John McGahern's critical statements on the Irish society of the mid 1960s. This is carried out by combining the notions of mind style (Semino, 2002), split selves (Emmot, 2002) and the blending theory (Fauconnier and Turner, 1994, 2002). The description of two of the main characters of the novel (Mahoney, a widower, and Father Gerald, a priest) and two of the most relevant scenes (the Corpus Christi procession and the young protagonist's sexual arousal with an advert torn from a newspaper) are analysed in terms of multiple metonymic correspondences which interact within the blend to yield a series of antagonistic metaphors. Through the eyes of the teenage narrator, McGahern makes an outrageous ideological statement against Puritanism and Catholicism.",['shs']

Exact and inexact Hummel-Seebeck method for variational inclusions,"We deal with a perturbed version of a Hummel-Seebeck type method to approximate a solution of variational inclusions of the form : 0 ∈ Φ(z) + F(z) where Φ is a single-valued function twice continuously Fréchet differentiable and F is a set-valued map from Rn to the closed subsets of Rn. This framework is convenient to treat in a unified way standard sequential quadratic programming, its stabilized version, sequential quadratically constrained quadratic programming, and linearly constrained Lagrangian methods (see [1]).

C in CS1: Snags and Viable Solution,"Programming is one of the career rewarding skills; however, learning programming skill is extremely hard and arduous as supported by several studies. The first programming language has an everlasting impact on the programmer's program's development abilities. In most of the universities the imperative paradigm is used for introductory programming courses and generally C language is used as a base language of a first programming course. The C language is a leading programming language and extensively utilized for commercial applications. The majority of the programming languages are highly motivated from the C language, yet its intrinsic complexities and non-pedagogic origin evidently makes it hard and a complex choice for a first programming course. This paper proposed a rational and realizable solution that can make a C language a suitable choice for a first the course of programming. dexterity of programming experts. Their knowledge is not general but context specific [6]. Beginning students are restricted to the surface knowledge, deficient in comprehensive mental models, unsuccessful to employ pertinent knowledge, and visualize the programming line-by-line rather than utilizing consequential program components or formations. The introductory programming course is a "" gate-keeper "" to triumph and success in computer science/ computing education [7]. The significance of an appropriately defined first course in programming (usually called CS1) can not be overstated. The first programming course leaves the beginning students with good programming practices [8]. A poor experience may have a worse impact on student attitude, and may result in a change in majors.",['info']
Numerical Data Modelling and Classification in Marine Geology by the SPSS Statistics,"The paper focuses on the geostatistical analysis of the data set on the Philippine archipelago. The research question is understanding variability in several geospatial parameters (geology, geomorphology, tectonics and bathymetry) in different segments of the study area. The initial data set was generated in QGIS by digitizing 25 cross-sectioning profiles. The data set contained information on the geospatial parameters in the samples by profiles. Modelling and statistical analysis were performed in SPSS IBM Statistics software. The analysis of the topography shows strong variability of the elevations in the samples with the extreme depths in the central part of the study area (profile 13 with -9,400 m) and highest elevations in its south-western part (profile 17 with 1950 m). The analysis of the geological classes and lithology shows maximal samples of the basic volcanic rocks (40,40%) followed by mixed sedimentary consolidated rocks (31,90 %). Pairwise analysis of the sediment thickness and slope aspect demonstrates correlation between these two variables with the maximal sediment layer in the profiles 1-4 crossing the Philippines. The hierarchical dendrogram clustering of the bathymetry by three approaches shown maximal correlation of 5 clusters containing profile groups: 12-18 (centre), 22-25 (south-west), 1-2 (north), 7-8 (north-east), 19-21 (south-west). Other profiles show lesser similarities in the bathymetric patterns. The forecasting models were computed for the geospatial variables showing gradual increase in the gradient angles southwards and increased values for the sediment thickness in the north. Technically, the results proved effectiveness of the SPSS application of the geological data modelling.","['math', 'phys']"
« Car ils croient qu’ils sont ce qu’ils sont » Le petit caillou de l’humour contre la superbe du pouvoir,"La fonction de l'humour n'est pas de restaurer le statu quo d'une justice close, ni d'opposer une force à la force, mais plutôt de substituer au triomphe des triomphants le doute et la précarité, de tordre le cou à l'éloquence et à la bonne conscience bourgeoise des vainqueurs. Vladimir Jankélévitch1 l 'humour juif témoigne d'une exigeante lucidité : face aux régi-mes qui se vantent d'avoir mené l'histoire vers son accomplissement, il met en question les certitudes sans cesse proclamées. Il encourage un regard déshabitué, afin que l'homme dégrisé perçoive la vanité du pouvoir, de la richesse, de l'arrogance, de certaines convenances et de la hiérarchie sociale. L'humour juif nous révèle combien notre monde est factice et nous aide à en démystifier la fausse sécurité. L'humour n'existe que là où il peut être échangé, où il s'accompagne d'un clin d'oeil complice, d'un sourire à peine appuyé, d'un silence de connivence. « Et selon les cas, il vous glace ou il vous ravit, il vous comble ou il vous transperce. C'est qu'il est tout miel et tout fiel, les deux, il rit et il pleure, il console et il rend des coups »2. La présente étude comporte des limites dont nous sommes pleinement conscient. L'humour est souvent une parole en acte, qui s'exprime dans des circonstances particulières, selon un code social bien défini. Il répond alors à une attente, et s'accompagne de mimiques et de gestes qui prolongent le dire. La langue des Juifs européens, le jiddich de l'ouest et celui de l'est, tout comme les emprunts aux parlers des sociétés d'accueil, lui donnent sa tonalité propre, sa petite musique. La dimension « politique » de l'humour juif résulte de sa volonté de miner le réel et de promouvoir une présence décalée au monde. Elle s'exprime dans la dénonciation de l'absurdité de la guerre et de sa folie meurtrière, tout comme dans la critique de la violence ordinaire. Cet humour a également « un rôle social » dans la mesure où il crève d'un coup d'épingle la boursouflure du paraître, en se gaussant du parvenu. Il rend sa dignité à celui qui, refusant de rentrer dans la course de la réussite, se tient résolument hors du jeu de la produc-tivité et de la rentabilité. En même temps, il débusque l'enjeu matériel que masquent certaines conventions sociales, telles le mariage. Enfin, sans céder au scepticisme dans « le domai-ne religieux », il se plaît à souligner le désordre de la Création et à montrer que la Promesse est bien mal tenue.",['shs']

Investigating the Effect of Blending Kerosene and Palm Oil with Diesel Fuel,Burning of petroleum based fuels results in severe air pollution. To minimize this environmental impact mankind try to identify a new alternative source of fuel. A lot of experimentation has been done to identify a good source of alternative.The existing studies have discovered that vegetable oils can be a good substitute for diesel fuel.But using vegetable oils directly in an engine is not feasible due to their high viscosity and low volatility. As a result blends of vegetable oils are used in engines as an alternative of diesel.Here in this investigation the effect of blending kerosene and palm oil with diesel fuel is shown. Investigations are conducted using various blends of kerosene and palm oil with diesel. At first kerosene alone is blended with diesel in various ratios and the effect of blending was identified.After that the effect of blending palm oil alone with diesel in various ratio was determined. At last palm oil and kerosene together blended with diesel fuel in equal portion and the change in various fuel properties was determined. The effect of blending palm oil and kerosene alone with diesel is compared with the effect of blending palm oil and kerosene together with diesel. In order to compare the effects various fuel properties were measured. This study mainly concentrate on lower heating value (LHV) or lower calorific value (LCV) and density for various comparison purposes.,['spi']
The Bad GuysLes sales têtesLa Faccia del Cattivo,"To our great surprise, these questions lead us to a journey in the past in very respectable places: science temples of the 19th century, research laboratories and scientific discussion... In the footsteps of the researchers with a mutual obsession: discover, from the body of individuals, law that will determine their future actions. Berlin, 1943: Bruno Lüdke, a young man from the suburbs, is accused of 81 murders. Everything in his physical appearance accuses him, starting with his face: a ""dirty face"", a real psycho face. For the police at the time, there is no doubt: he is guilty... Today his name is still associated with the image of a frightful serial killer. But what is a dirty face, really? Has this portrait of the typical criminal evolved over time? Who, and which logic provided the criterions for the dirty face?Dès les débuts de la criminologie, au XIXe siècle, des scientifiques ont tenté de dresser le portrait-robot du criminel, mêlant leurs présupposés idéologiques à des méthodes contestables. Phrénologie, fichage anthropométrique, anthropologie criminelle et eugénisme établissent un lien entre traits de caractère et traits physiques. Dans la lignée de l’atavisme, le médecin italien Cesare Lombroso affirme qu’un physique simiesque, avec des mâchoires proéminentes, des arcades sourcilières développées et des oreilles décollées, est synonyme de retard mental et de sauvagerie. Pour son plus grand malheur, l’Allemand Bruno Lüdke répond parfaitement à ces critères. Il incarne la brute épaisse à la perfection. Dans ""Les Sales Têtes"", images d’archives et photos à l’appui, des experts français, allemands et italiens reviennent sur ces théories.Commettere un crimine è ricollegabile a considerazioni biologiche e genetiche? Possono, i potenziali criminali, essere riconosciuti e identificati attraverso i tratti somatici ? La Faccia del Cattivo racconta la storia romanzesca di Bruno Ludke, il presunto serial killer tedesco, scoprendo che le teorie biologiche sul crimine risalgono a tanto tempo fa. Bruno Lüdke è passato alla storia come uno dei più feroci serial killer di tutti i tempi. Nel 1943 venne accusato di 51 omicidi, di cui non fu certamente l’autore. Non c’era una sola prova a suo carico, se non la sua faccia, giudicata il perfetto “tipo” del criminale. Com’è fatta, allora, una faccia da assassino? Chi l’ha definita, descritta, certificata? Come può, il volto di una persona, avere tanta forza da vincere ogni dubbio ? La risposta a queste domande conduce in luoghi insospettabili: templi della scienza, laboratori di ricerca, convegni internazionali di luminari. Un’intera branca della scienza che interpreta la faccia degli altri come una sorta di schermo su cui, più o meno inconsapevolmente, proiettiamo regole di cittadinanza e di esclusione. Attraverso il caso Lüdke, esploriamo gli snodi profondi di una civiltà – la nostra – che in modo ricorrente tenta di criminalizzare (e, a volte, eliminare) i “meno adatti”.",['shs']
On the nonlinearity of idempotent quadratic functions and the weight distribution of subcodes of Reed-Muller codes,"The Walsh transform \hat{Q} of a quadratic function Q : F2^n → F2 satisfies |\hat{Q(b)}| ∈ {0, 2 n+s 2 } for all b ∈ F_{2^n} , where 0 ≤ s ≤ n − 1 is an integer depending on Q. In this article, we investigate two classes of such quadratic Boolean functions which attracted a lot of research interest. For arbitrary integers n we determine the distribution of the parameter s for both of the classes, C1 = {Q(x) = Tr_n(\sum^{(n−1)/2}_{ i=1} a_ix^{2^i +1}) : a_i ∈ F2}, and the larger class C2, defined for even n as C2 = {Q(x) = Tr_n(^{(n/2)−1}_ { i=1} a_ix^{2^i +1}) + Tr_n/2 (a_{n/2} x^{2^n/2 +1}) : a_i ∈ F2}. Our results have two main consequences. We obtain the distribution of the non-linearity for the rotation symmetric quadratic Boolean functions, which have been attracting considerable attention recently. We also present the complete weight distribution of the corresponding subcodes of the second order Reed-Muller codes.",['info']
DPiSAX: Massively Distributed Partitioned iSAX,"Indexing is crucial for many data mining tasks that rely on efficient and effective similarity query processing. Consequently, indexing large volumes of time series, along with high performance similarity query processing, have became topics of high interest. For many applications across diverse domains though, the amount of data to be processed might be intractable for a single machine, making existing centralized indexing solutions inefficient. We propose a parallel indexing solution that gracefully scales to billions of time series, and a parallel query processing strategy that, given a batch of queries, efficiently exploits the index. Our experiments, on both synthetic and real world data, illustrate that our index creation algorithm works on 1 billion time series in less than 2 hours , while the state of the art centralized algorithms need more than 5 days. Also, our distributed querying algorithm is able to efficiently process millions of queries over collections of billions of time series, thanks to an effective load balancing mechanism.",['info']
RadiusSketch: Massively Distributed Indexing of Time Series,"Performing similarity queries on hundreds of millions of time series is a challenge requiring both efficient indexing techniques and parallelization.

The sketch method, as we have implemented, is superior in both quality and response time compared with the state of the art approach, iSAX2+. Already, in the sequential case it improves recall and precision by a factor of two, while giving shorter response times. In a parallel environment with 32 processors, on both real and synthetic data, our parallel approach improves by a factor of up to 100 in index time construction and up to 15 in query answering time. Finally, our data structure makes use of idle computing time to improve the recall and precision yet further.",['info']

"Soils, a Factor in Plant Production: Agroecosystems","This chapter highlights the conditions for sustainable management of agricultural soils, mobilizing the concepts of agroecology. The relationship between agriculture and soil has evolved over the last century. In order to define the agricultural capability of a soil, the following two groups of properties must be considered. The first group deals with the conditions that determine the proper rooting of plants. The second group deals with the soil characteristics that govern the amount of water and mineral elements available to feed the plants. On a global scale, soils suitable for agricultural production are limited because of the characteristics of the environment or of the soils themselves. The transformation of soil production potential by soil management through organic fertilization or irrigation, for example, also contributes to transforming the soils themselves. Agroecosystem management involves technical, environmental, cultural and socioeconomic dimensions, which co‐evolve over time.","['sdv', 'phys']"

Numerical and Experimental Investigations on Deep Drawing of G1151 Carbon Fiber Woven Composites,"This study proposes to simulate the deep drawing on carbon woven composites in order to reduce the manufacturing cost and waste of composite material during the stamping process, The multi-scale anisotropic approach of woven composite was used to develop a finite element model for simulating the orientation of fibers accurately and predicting the deformation of composite during mechanical tests and forming process. The proposed experimental investigation for bias test and hemispherical deep drawing process is investigated in the G1151 Interlock. The mechanical properties of carbon fiber have great influence on the deformation of carbon fiber composites. In this study, shear angle–displacement curves and shear load–shear angle curves were obtained from a bias extension test. Deep drawing experiments and simulation were conducted, and the shear load–displacement curves under different forming depths and shear angle–displacement curves were obtained. The results showed that the compression and shear between fibers bundles were the main deformation mechanism of carbon fiber woven composite, as well as the maximum shear angle for the composites with G1151 woven fiber was 58°. In addition, during the drawing process, it has been found that the forming depth has a significant influence on the drawing force. It increases rapidly with the increasing of forming depth. In this approach the suitable forming depth deep drawing of the sheet carbon fiber woven composite was approximately 45 mm.",['spi']
Grounding Humanoid Visually Guided Walking: From Action-independent to Action-oriented Knowledge,"In the context of humanoid and service robotics, it is essential that the agent can be positioned with respect to objects of interest in the environment. By relying mostly on the cognitivist conception in artificial intelligence, the research on visually guided walking has tended to overlook the characteristics of the context in which behavior occurs. Consequently, considerable efforts have been directed to define action-independent explicit models of the solution, often resulting in high computational requirements. In this study, inspired by the embodied cognition research, our interest has focused on the analysis of the sensory-motor coupling. Notably, on the relation between embodiment, information, and action-oriented representation. Hence, by mimicking human walking, a behavior scheme is proposed and endowed the agent with the skill of approaching stimuli. A significant contribution to object discrimination was obtained, by exploiting the redundancies and the statistical regularities induced in the sensory-motor coordination, thus salience is anticipated from the fusion of visual and proprioceptive information in a Bayesian network. The solution was implemented on the humanoid platform Nao, where the task was accomplished in an unstructured scenario.","['info', 'spi']"
Sliding wear behavior of magnetron sputtered chromium carbide thin films,"Purpose – The purpose of this technical paper is to investigate the friction and wear behavior of inexpensive and durable cutting tools, developed for wood machining using duplex treatment. Design/methodology/approach – Cr–(WC–Co) coatings were eposited onto carburized low-alloy steel substrate by a reactive magnetron sputtering. The total coating thickness was approximately 2 m. Unlubricated wear tests have been performed using a disc sample sliding against an alumina ball (Al2O3) and a wood (beech) pin. Findings – The paper provides information about the effect of duplex reatment on the surface properties of low-alloy steel against wood and offers practical help for the researchers in coating topic. Originality/value – Experimental results showed that sliding wear properties of the selected coatings are strongly dependent on the counter-face material. When tested against alumina balls, the wear mechanisms are oxidative wear followed by a combination of adhesive and abrasive wear, while a combination of an oxidative and adhesive wear was the main wear mechanism observed against a wood pin.",['spi']
Choice of a methodological approach for the estimation of recoverable resources with uranium deposits in central Jordan,"Choosing a resource estimation approach for uranium deposits central Jordan needs to consider various issues; the particular geological context of these deposits, the varying degree of reliability of input data and the level of selectivity that can be reasonably envisaged at a production stage. These issues make this resource estimation challenging from a geostatistical perspective. Here, we provide details of the approach used during resource estimation for the surficial part of uranium deposits in central Jordan; as a more standard approach has been applied to the deeper parts of these deposits. The workflow is as follows: (i) Interpolation of the geometry of the mineralised formation. Kriging with external drift is applied to model hangingwall and footwall surfaces. (ii) Estimation of global resources by 2D estimation of layer thicknesses and uranium accumulation using channel samples within delineated areas. (iii) Accounting for vertical selectivity and development of grade tonnage curves using uniform conditioning (UC) followed by localised post-processing (called LUC) delivering, a 3D block model at the selective mining unit support scale. A description of the UC/LUC approach and the adaptations made in order to account for the variable thickness is presented in this paper. This approach involves performing UC on each panel in turn with a thickness varying from panel to panel. This leads to a specific change of support coefficients for each panel. The illustrations of this approach are taken from one specific zone within the Central Jordan deposits. © 2015 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and The AusIMM.",['math']
Neutron diffraction measurements of residual stress distribution in large zirconia based refractory bricks produced by electro-fusion and casting,"Electro-fusion and casting is used to produce large refractory bricks (∼250 kg) containing a high amount of ZrO2. These bricks are used in glass-making furnaces where good mechanical performance is required at very high temperatures (>1500 °C). During the manufacturing procedure, they develop large residual stresses as a result of the cooling conditions and structural phase transformations they underwent. This leads to stress concentration and crack formation at different length scales. In order to characterize these phenomena, a ‘multi-scale’ analysis approach is under development, where different internal strain measurement methods are combined. In this approach we benefit from different gauge volumes provided by various diffraction methods, ranging from a few hundred nanometres to a few tens of millimetres. In the present paper, the results of neutron diffraction measurements on large ZrO2 blocks are given. These results show the level of internal strains at the millimetre scale, based on <img height=""17"" border=""0"" style=""vertical-align:bottom"" width=""39"" alt=""View the MathML source"" title=""View the MathML source"" src=""http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0955221917300225-si4.gif"">(3¯11) reflection of the monoclinic ZrO2.

New highly efficient amine-free and peroxide-free redox system for free radical polymerization under air with possible light activation,"Efficient redox initiating systems for radical polymerizations under air usually show some severe drawbacks such as handling and toxicity of the oxidizing agent (peroxides, persulfates, peroxidiphosphates, disulfides, etc.), toxicity of the reducing agent (aromatic amines such as 4-N,N-trimethylaniline), and more generally a low top surface conversion due to high oxygen inhibition. The originality of the proposed paper relies on the development of new redox initiating systems for the polymerization of (meth)acrylate monomers that does not contain any hazardous compound (no peroxide) and is amine-free (low toxicology issues). And these new systems that possess the advantages of redox-initiated polymerization (possibility to cure thick samples) can also be photoactivated in order to have a faster and better curing of the surface of the sample (advantages of the photopolymerization to overcome the oxygen inhibition). The light activations presented in this work have been done with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as they have a low energy consumption and are safer to the user than UV light. Two wavelengths have been used: 405 nm (in the blue range of the spectrum) and 780 nm (in the near-infrared) showing the versatility of these new photo/redox initiating systems. In particular, the reactivity in the near-IR (not related to any heating of the sample) is a very original result. In addition with the presentation of the performance of the new systems in polymerization and photoactivated polymerization, a full analysis of the chemical mechanisms and species involved has been performed. Remarkably, the new proposed Cu(acac)2/2dppba system is also able to overcome the oxygen inhibition for free radical redox (photo)polymerization.",['chim']

Asymptotic analysis of a thin rigid stratified elastic plate – viscous fluid interaction problem,"A three-dimensional model for the interaction of a thin stratified rigid plate and a viscous fluid layer is considered. This problem depends on a small parameter $\varepsilon$ which is the ratio of the thickness of the plate and that of the fluid layer. The right-hand side functions are 1-periodic with respect to the tangential variables of the plate. The plate’s Young’s modulus is of order $\varepsilon^{-3}$, i.e. it is great, while its density is of order 1. At the solid–fluid interface, the velocity and the normal stress are continuous. The variational analysis of this model (including the existence, uniqueness of the solution and its regularity) is provided. An asymptotic expansion of the solution is constructed and justified. The error estimate is proved for the partial sums of the asymptotic expansion. The limit problem contains a non-standard boundary condition for the Stokes equations. The existence, uniqueness, and regularity of its solution are proved. The asymptotic analysis is applied to the partial asymptotic dimension reduction of the solid phase and the derivation of the asymptotically exact junction conditions between two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of the plate.","['math', 'phys']"
Thermo-mechanical characterization of the Ti17 titanium alloy under extreme loading conditions,"Understanding the physics of chip formation in machining operations is often difficult due to the complexity of the phenomena involved, such as the extreme and complex loading conditions that occur in the cutting zone.

In this context, this paper presents a study of the mechanical behavior of the Ti17 titanium alloy at high strain rates and high temperatures. This has been achieved by undertaking compression and shear tests over a wide range of strain rates (from 10−1 s−1 to 100 s−1) and temperatures (from 25 to 800 ◦C). The results show that the Ti17 alloy is sensitive to strain rate, especially for strain rates greater than 1 s−1. In addition, the alloy retains good mechanical properties at high temperature (up to 500 ◦C). Based on the experimental results, the parameter of the Johnson-Cook constitutive equation have been identified using the inverse method. Some weaknesses in the model have been highlighted after the identification phase, especially in terms of the m and C parameters. A modification of the model has been proposed.",['spi']
Contribution in the evaluation of a performance index of hot forging dies,The present paper focuses on a new concept of evaluation of a performance index of hot forging dies through the combination of a process behaviour model and a reliability approach analysis of the forging process. The process behaviour is modelled and simulated using the computer-aided engineering FORGE® tool that allowed optimizing the forging parameters and determining the stresses and strains together with temperatures during the forging process and also identifying the factors affecting the die life. The respective reliability mechanical model is developed and reliability simulations have been conducted using PHIMECASoft tool in order to evaluate the reliability index β and determine the sensitivity of the variations in the random values of the input parameters of the forging process. The concept of this contribution has been applied to real industrial dies used to forge automotive steering levers produced in the forging workshop of the Ferrovial Company of Annaba in Algeria. The performance index is given by the number of forged parts corresponding to the reliability index of the dies before failure occurs.,['spi']
Modeling and optimization of a ball-burnished aluminum alloy flat surface with a crossed strategy based on response surface methodology,"In this work, a new ball-burnishing strategy, in two crossed passes, was applied on the flat machined surface of 2017A-T451 aluminum alloy to investigate the influence of three classical ball-burnishing factors (burnishing speed Vb in mm/min, depth of penetration ab in μm and lateral feed f in mm) on the treated surface integrity enhancement. Experimental work is based on the application of an experimental face-centered composite design (CCD) formed by three factors at three levels. The mathematical modeling of the average roughness Ra, of the mean spacing of roughness profile irregularities Sm and of the surface hardness HIT of the treated surfaces was performed by the response surface methodology (RSM). Best ball-burnished surface integrity has been established by the application of optimal ballburnishing studied factors (Vb = 500 mm/min, ab=40 μm, and f = 0.2 mm). High surface quality is then characterized by a gain in average roughness Ra of 81 %, an enhancement in the mean spacing of profile irregularities Sm of 34%and an improvement in surface nano-hardness HIT of 17 % when compared to the machined surface. Machined and ballburnished optimized surface characterization confirms surface finishing process power and contribution to surface integrity enhancement of treated flat surface.","['spi', 'phys']"
Investigating surface roughness of ZE41 magnesium alloy cast by low-pressure sand casting process,"The sand mold 3D printing technologies enable the manufacturing of molds with great dimensional accuracy. However, the roughness of as-cast components is higher when cast in a 3D printed mold rather than in a traditional sand mold. Coating the inner cavity is an efficient solution but can be costly and, in the narrowest cavities, not achievable. Finding a procedure to reduce the as-cast roughness without coating would ease the casting procedures. In the present work, surface analysis of ZE41 magnesium alloy is presented after being cast in 3D printed furan sand molds without coating using the low-pressure casting process. The molten metal temperature was measured during casting at different positions along the cast cavity. The as-cast surface roughness was correlated to the molten metal temperature and solid fraction at the time of contact against the sand mold surface.",['spi']
Generalised cutting force model including contact radius effect for turning operations on Ti6Al4V titanium alloy,"Current constraints on aeronautical parts have led to the introduction of materials like titanium alloys as well as new part geometries featuring large dimensions and reduced thickness. Inappropriate cutting forces during turning operations could lead to high deflections and damage to the machine. In order to ensure the respect of final part geometry and the optimal use of resources, cutting forces have to be known, to anticipate the deformed shape during and after machining operations on thin parts. Current models are offering a solution which can be optimised by the modelling influence of the ploughing effect on cutting forces. Therefore, a mechanistic model is developed in order to improve the prediction of cutting forces during turning operations on titanium alloy Ti6Al4V: this model includes the effect of the clearance face contact radius and comprises two main steps. First, the effect of the clearance contact radius and the effect of the cutting edge lead angle are determined independently, via a direct identification method based on elementary cutting tests. Secondly, this analysis is extended to cutting trials in boring, cylindrical turning and face turning. Then, based on a mechanistic approach, a model is defined according to the previous results and the coefficients are identified thanks to cutting trials in real conditions. The results of the proposed model are then compared to a commonly used model which takes into account mostly the uncut chip thickness effect. It is demonstrated that the proposed cutting force model provides a more accurate prediction of cutting forces.",['spi']
Numerical analysis of constitutive coefficients effects on FE simulation of the 2D orthogonal cutting process: application to the Ti6Al4V,"In this paper, a deep study of constitutive parameters definition effect is done in order to guarantee sufficient reliability of the finite element machining modeling. The case of a particular biphasic titanium alloy Ti6Al4V known by its low machinability is investigated. The Johnson-Cook (JC) elasto-thermo-visco-plastic-damage model combined with the energy-based ductile fracture criteria is used. Segmentation frequency, chip curvature radius, shear band spacing, chip serration sensitivity and intensity, accumulated plastic strain in the formed chip segments, and cutting forces levels are determined where their dependency to every constitutive coefficient is examined and highlighted. It is demonstrated from the separate variation of every plastic and damage parameters that an interesting finite element modeling (FEM) relevance is reached with the adjustment of JC strain hardening coefficients term, thermal softening parameter, exponent fracture factor, and damage evolution energy. Moderate and high cutting speeds are applied to the cutting tool in the aim to test their impact on shear localization, chip segmentation, and numerical forces levels as well as to approve previous highlighted findings related to constitutive parameters definition. In general, this study focuses on a prominent decrease in identification process cost with the previous knowledge of the most affecting constitutive coefficients while keeping an interesting agreement between numerical and experimental results.",['spi']
Inviscid approach for upwind sails aerodynamics. How far can we go?,"This work presents a full-scale experimental study of a yacht rig and sails in real upwind sailing conditions and a comparison with Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations with the ARAVANTI model (Finite Element Method for the structure and Vortex Lattice Method for the fluid). An specific on-board instrumentation system simultaneously measures loads in the rig and sails, sailing data (wind, boat attitude and speed) and the shape of sails in real navigation conditions (flying shape). Flying shape parameters are extracted using the camera-based VSPARS system to characterize the effects of sail trims and to be compared with the results of the simulation. The potential flow solver gives fast and accurate predictions of both the flying shape and the loads in the rig in most conditions. The inviscid approach, commonly used in the early stage of design, must be checked, as in particular cases where the sails are heavily loaded, flow separation is significant and results from a potential flow solver are inaccurate. A new version of the model including the heel angle as an additional degree of freedom in the structural solver enables to detect when the inviscid flow approach overestimates the aerodynamic load. This upgrade improves the utility and reliability of the inviscid flow approach which remains relevant at the early stages of design as it is much more cost-effective than RANS models.",['spi']

Intervertebral disc swelling demonstrated by 3D and water content magnetic resonance analyses after a 3-day dry immersion simulating microgravity,"Background Vertebral deconditioning is commonly experienced after space flight and simulation studies. Disc herniation (DH) is quadrupled after space flight. Purpose The main hypothesis formulated by the authors is that microgravity results in intervertebral disc swelling. Study Design The aim of the study was to identify the morphological changes of the spine and their clinical consequences after simulated microgravity by 3-day dry immersion (DI). The experimental protocol was performed on 12 male volunteers using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy before and after DI. Methods All the experiment was financially supported by CNES (Centre national d’études spatiales i.e. French Space Agency). Results We observed an increase in rachis height of 1.5 ± 0.4 cm and a decrease in curvature, particularly for the lumbar region with a decrease of -4 ± 2.5°. We found a significant increase in intervertebral disc (IVD) volume of +8 ± 9% at T12-L1 and +11 ± 9% at L5-S1. This phenomenon is likely associated with the increase in disc intervertebral water content (IWC), 17 ± 27%. During the 3 days in DI, 92% of the subjects developed back pain in the lumbar region below the diaphragmatic muscle. This clinical observation may be linked to the morphological changes of the spine. Conclusions The morphological changes observed and, specifically, the disc swelling caused by increased IWC may contribute to understanding disc herniation after microgravity exposure. Our results confirmed the efficiency of the 3-day DI model to reproduce quickly the effects of microgravity on spine morphology. Our findings raise the question of the subject selection in spatial studies, especially studies about spine morphology and reconditioning programs after space flight. These results may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying disc herniation and may serve as the basis to develop countermeasures for astronauts and to prevent IVD herniation and back pain on Earth.",['sde']
How to Best Nest Regular Path Queries,"Regular path queries (RPQs) define query patterns in terms of regu-lar expressions and are therefore well-suited to query for paths over roles in DL. RPQs can be extended to 2-way RPQs (with converse), CRPQs (with conjunc-tions), or PRPQs (arbitrary positive Boolean combinations), all of which have been explored in DL research. Another natural extension of any query language is nesting, where query predicates can be defined in terms of subqueries. In this pa-per, we discuss several ways of introducing nesting to PRPQs, and show that they lead to increasingly expressive query languages: CN2RPQs, which were stud-ied in the context of DLs recently; nested P2RPQs; and positive queries with transitive closure on binary predicates. The latter is one of the most expressive languages for which query answering can still be decided over DL knowledge bases. We present initial complexity results that show query answering to be non-elementary in the worst case, with an exponential increase for each level of nest-ing of the transitive closure operator.",['info']
Is there a win-win scenario with increased beef quality and reduced consumption?,"In the scientific literature, the debate on health and environmental benefits of a reduction in the share of animal-sourced food, in particular beef, in consumer diets is mostly focused on demand-side vs. supply transitions. We discuss in this paper the necessary conditions for a win-win scenario to exist, where consumer preferences for diets with less red meat are accompanied by a transition in livestock production systems towards higher average quality of beef. Trade-offs between quantity and quality of beef at the consumer level, and between domestic and international markets for producers are presented, as well as the determinants of reduced beef consumption, productivity gains, innovation in quality and environmental impacts in the case of France. We present a simplified model of aggregate consumer surplus and producer profit, with decisions on beef demand, output price and quality, to explore the necessary combination of changes in consumer preferences, producer strategies and public policies, required to produce a win-win scenario. Our experiment provides conditions for a win-win scenario, including increased efficiency on domestic and international beef markets and enhanced consumer awareness. We suggest research priorities and policy recommendations for accompanying transition in food preferences and cattle production system.",['shs']

"GMT-based geological mapping and assessment of the bathymetric variations of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, Pacific Ocean","This manuscript summarizes the results of the geospatial analysis undertaken by means of Generic Mapping Tools (GMT). The comparative assessment of the bathymetry of the Kuril-Kamchatka hadal trench was performed for southern and northern segments separated by the Bussol Strait. The formation of the hadal trench is affected by the impacts of local geological and geophysical settings varying along the trench. The methodological approach is as follows. The profiling was undertaken using GMT modules 'grdimage', 'grdtrack' and 'psxy'. The modelling consists of the collected data of 10706 observation samples from 52 profiles in southern part and 12726 from 62 profiles in the northern segment. The GMT modules 'psrose' and 'pshistograms' were used to plot histograms and rose diagrams visualizing bathymetric variables of depths. The geology was mapped using GMT modules 'pscoast', 'grdcut', 'grdcontour' and 'psxy' to plot lineaments and geological objects (ophiolites, faults, earthquakes, trench, magnetic anomalies, tectonic slabs, fracture zones and volcanoes). The base map is based on the ETOPO Global Relief Model. The comparison of the bathymetry shown variations in the northern and southern segments: southern part reaches-8,200 m maximal depths while northern has-7,800 m. This is influenced by the geological settings: earthquakes magnitude and seismisity are higher in the southwest. The submarine terraces and floodplains were observed at-4000 m depth forming landforms located southwards off the Bussol Strait. This geospatial analysis contributes to the development of the geological mapping with an example of the Kamchatka area, a region with high seismisity and repeated earthquakes.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"
K-means Clustering in R Libraries {cluster} and {factoextra} for Grouping Oceanographic Data,"Cluster analysis by k-means algorithm by R programming applied for the geological data analysis is the scope of the presented paper. The research object is the Mariana Trench, a hadal trench located in west Pacific Ocean. The study evaluates the similarity of the geological data by the analysis of their attributes. The original observation data set contained samples varying in parameters: geology (sediment thickness), tectonics (locations on the tectonic plates), volcanism (igneous volcanic areas), bathymetry (depth ranges) and geomorphology (slope steepness and aspect). The data pool was divided to the clusters using k-means algorithm with aim to detect similarities. Clustering was chosen as a main statistical method, since it enables detecting similar groups within the original data set by unsupervised classification. Technically, the research was performed using R language and its statistical libraries. The main R libraries include {cluster}, {factoextra}; minor libraries include {ggplot2}, {FactoMiner}, {openxlsx}, {carData}, {rio}, {car} and {flashClust}. Several clusters were tested from two to seven, the optimal number is defined as five. The results show visualized computations: correlation matrix of the factors; comparison of the bi-factors showing pairwise correlation; pairwise comparative analysis showing influence of the variables as bi-factors: sediment thickness correlating with slope angles ; correlation of the volcanic igneous areas with slope angles and aspect degree. Four variables affect geomorphology: slope angle, sediment thickness, aspect degree, bathymetry and volcanism. The paper includes listings of R programming codes for repeatability of the algorithms in similar research.","['info', 'phys']"
Will Eisner and the evolution of the graphic novel,"This year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of American cartoonist and writer, Will Eisner. Important exhibitions have been organised to commemorate his artistic legacy – including one in Angoulême, France at the Musée de la Bande Dessinée and another in New York at the Museum of Illustration. In the course of his long career, Eisner (1917–2005) had a lasting influence on comics, not only through his works – from The Spirit in the 1940s to A Contract with God in 1978 – but also by initiating new ways of thinking and talking about comics. Championing and teaching “sequential art”, he also contributed to popularisation of the term “graphic novel”. Poster for the Will Eisner exhibition in Angoulême (France). Angoulême Museum of Comics This catch-all label now refers primarily to the format, but also a literary genre, the most celebrated examples of which are marked by a sense of seriousness and ambition – Art Spiegelman’s Maus, for example. As the term has spread since the 1980s, however, its outlines have become blurry. The ambition of the expression “graphic novel” was initially one of distinction – its promoters wanted to break with a mainstream comics production they saw as childish.",['shs']
Interpreting chemistry and technology of lime binders and implementing it in the conservation fieldInterpretação da química e da tecnologia de ligantes à base de cal e sua implementação no campo da conservação,"The objective of the paper is the compilation, review and dissemination of updated scientific knowledge on lime theory and technology in the field of heritage conservation.The strong evidence of the last decade's research on the positive effect of the -not demonstrable by a chemical equation – 'key' missing link of the maturation process is highlighted. It is demonstrated that the exceptional perfor-mance characteristics of durable lime based mortars predominately rely on the capacity for rapid, efficient and extensive carbona-tion of the air-hardening phase of limes, in particular when matured (nanoparticle wet slaked) lime putties are used; and on the chemical and mechanical stability of the strength components (principally CSHs) of the hydraulic phase of limes, which is higher in their more crystalline forms of historical lime-pozzolan mixtures than in their amorphous forms of modern cements. Hence, physicochemical adhesion and cohesion bonds both at the lime matrix and at the binder/aggregate interfaces are ensured imparting minimization of cracks and durability to lime based mortars and historic masonries.The comprehensive documentation of the former leads to optimal materials and procedures to preserve our cultural heritage.O objectivo do presente artigo é a compilação, revisão e disseminação do actual conhecimento científico sobre teoria e tecnologia da cal no campo da conservação do património. Com base na investigação da última década, são destacados os fortes indícios do efeito positivo – não demonstrável por equação química – do elo perdido 'chave', o processo de maturação. É demonstrado que as excepcionais características de desempenho das argamassas à base de cal mais duráveis dependem predominantemente das suas capacidades para uma rápida, eficiente e extensa carbonatação da fase de presa aérea da cal, em particular quando é usada cal em pasta com maior tempo de maturação (extinção húmida ao nível das nanopartículas); e da estabilidade química e mecânica dos com-ponentes de resistência (principalmente silicatos de cálcio hidratados (CSHs)) da fase hidráulica da cal, que é mais elevada nas for-mas mais cristalinas das misturas históricas de cal e pozolana do que nas formas amorfas dos cimentos modernos. Deste modo são asseguradas as ligações fisico-químicas por adesão e por coesão, quer na matriz de cal, quer nas interfaces ligante/agregado, conferindo minimização de fissuras e durabilidade a argamassas à base de cal e alvenarias históricas. Uma abrangente documentação destes proces-sos permitirá a obtenção de materiais e procedimentos progressivamente mais adequados à preservação do nosso património cultural.",['spi']
Chessboard,"The color change allows the folder to make some patterns appear on a paper with one color on each side. One is used for the foreground, the other one, for the background. It is typically a folding sequence related to an 'edge effect': Usually, the color cannot change on a model without crossing one edge of the paper. There are some exceptions, but as an edge of the paper is hidden, it cannot be used anymore for color change; consequently, this situation is close to the previous one. When folding a chessboard from an initial square of paper, the color changes are numerous. There are several chessboards folded from a strip of paper, or using modular origami; much less models use a unique square of paper. It is not surprising that a large square is needed for folding (without cutting) a quite small chessboard. Can a 8x8 chessboard be folded from a small square of paper? What is the smallest one?",['info']
"Can origami be a source of innovation for science, engineering and architecture?","Origami is the ancient art of paper folding. It started with traditional designs, and then came to creation of new models, and more recently transpires into scientific applications and researches. One of the first topic deals with geometry; apart from being used for educational purposes, it raises non trivial questions.The dedicated field of computational origami emerged since 1996, making use of algorithms for optimization and design. The folding process itself is linked to the kinematics of mechanisms and materials; it is also a source of innovation for designing deployable, foldable, and shape-adaptive structures: stents, airbags, temporary roofs, compliant mechanisms, spatial applications… Both these features and the artistic background of origami are also used for design of architectural structures.The aim of this presentation is to give an overview of the synergy of origami and scientific topics, to illustrate its potential source of innovation, and to present recent advances in engineering field.",['phys']
Puzzle Game about Connectivity and Biological Corridors,"Landscape fragmentation prevents some species from moving as they should. This fragmentation, mainly due to urbanization, agriculture and forest exploitation, is a major cause of biodiversity loss. One of the options commonly envisaged to remedy this fragmentation - restore some connectivity - is the development of biological corridors. These corridors are natural spaces, usually linear. They allow species to move between different areas that are natural habitats for them. The aim of this game is to raise awareness among different audiences about issues related to biodiversity conservation, and more specifically the notion of landscape connectivity. The question is approached in a playful way: to determine, in a hypothetical landscape, the network of biological corridors, at the lowest cost, that would connect a fragmented set of natural habitats. The costs associated with sites that could be protected to form a corridor include monetary costs, ecological costs and social costs. This game also makes it possible to evoke human activities likely to develop in unprotected sites and have a negative impact on the preservation of biodiversity. It is a very simple game that cannot, of course, take into account all the complexity inherent in connectivity problems.","['info', 'sde']"
Semantics-based Profiles Modeling and Matching for Resources Access,"Heterogeneity of resources (information, users, hardware devices, etc.) placed at disposal has raised the problem of defining a generic model, which could be used as a basis for describing resources in various applications. In this article, we propose a profile generic model, which describes the logical structure, the contents and the semantics of non predefined resources. The goal is to clarify the semantics of profiles descriptive elements and to use this semantics for the definition of means for an automatic deduction of elements with compatible semantics between profiles described differently. The defined semantics is not limited to a particular application (it could be shared) and should then allow interoperability between profiles models coming eventually from different applications. In order to evaluate profiles interoperability, we define a flexible matching algorithm and we discuss the results of its implementation.L'hétérogénéité des ressources (informations, utilisateurs, dispositifs matériels, etc.) mises à disposition a soulevé le problème de la définition d'un modèle générique, qui pourrait être utilisé comme base de description de ressources dans différentes applications. Dans cet article, nous proposons un modèle générique de profil qui décrit la structure logique, le contenu et la sémantique de ressources non prédéfinies. Le but est d'expliciter la sémantique des éléments descriptifs d'un profil et d'utiliser cette sémantique pour définir des moyens de déduction automatique d'éléments de sémantique compatible entre profils décrits différemment. La sémantique définie n'est pas limitée à une application particulière (elle peut être partagée) et doit donc permettre de faire interopérer des profils issus éventuellement d'applications différentes. Afin d'évaluer l'interopérabilité de profils, nous définissons un algorithme d'appariement flexible et nous discutons des résultats de son implémentation.","['info', 'shs']"

An autoethnography of a patient with kidney renal failure - How experiences and social ties promote therapeutic mobility,"This paper deals with the determinants that encourage therapeutic mobility from Senegal to France. I am both a patient and a researcher and my thesis focused on how health professionals make decisions to refer patients to a dialysis method. I also underlined how patients with kidney failure construct their choice of dialysis method. As a patient in Senegal, a low income country, I experienced some difficulties due to insufficient human resources in the health sector, the little number of dialysis centers, medical pluralism and low performance of the health system.. Choosing a dialysis method depended on many factors such as doctors’ opinions, my family’s approach and my student status at that time, among other things. That situation resulted in the involvement of health professionals, of my family, who both talked me into going to France in order to get a kidney transplant. Therefore, I will analyse therapeutic mobility as the outcome of social factors and personal experience beyond social bifurcations. Then, I propose here, from my experience, how to move from low performance health system (Senegal) to a high performance one (France) through an autoethnography analysis.",['shs']
A data-driven temperature compensation approach for Structural Health Monitoring using Lamb waves,"This paper presents a temperature compensation method for Lamb wave structural health monitoring. The proposed approach considers a representation of the piezo-sensor signal through its Hilbert transform that allows one to extract the amplitude factor and the phase shift in signals caused by temperature changes. An ordinary least square (OLS) algorithm is used to estimate these unknown parameters. After estimating these parameters at each temperature in the operating range, linear functional relationships between the temperature and the estimated parameters are derived using the least squares method. A temperature compensation model is developed based on this linear relationship that allows one to reconstruct sensor signals at any arbitrary temperature. The proposed approach is validated numerically and experimentally for an anisotropic composite plate at different temperatures ranging from Formula to Formula . A close match is found between the measured signals and the reconstructed ones. This approach is interesting as it needs only a limited set of piezo-sensor signals at different temperatures for model training and temperature compensation at any arbitrary temperature. Damage localization results after temperature compensation demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness.","['info', 'spi']"
Experimental Estimation of the Elastic Modulus of Non-Hazardous Waste Incineration Bottom Ash Aggregates by Indentation Tests - Microanalysis of Particles by Scanning Electron Microscopy,"An original experimental campaign never conducted until now on Non-Hazardous Waste Incineration aggregates is presented in this paper. The experiments were conducted in two phases: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and instrumented indentation. A cartography followed by a series of Quantitative Chemical Microanalysis (QCM) was carried out on the 0/12.5 mm fraction of the particle size distribution. Instrumented indentation tests were carried out on isolated particles of 25 mm in diameter. Observations at the SEM yielded the exact chemical composition of the bottom ashes. It has been found that the proportions of the chemical elements composing the material are slightly different from those of other studies. This difference has made it possible to note that the zone of production of the bottom ash significantly influences their physicochemical characteristics. From the indentation curves obtained, the “Olivier and Pharr” method was used to determine the reduced modulus of elasticity “Er”. Mean values of approximately 65 GPa and 40 GPa were obtained respectively for vitreous phases and less vitreous ones.",['spi']
On stream selection for interference alignment in heterogeneous networks,"This paper proposes a stream selection algorithm to deal with the interference and increase the sum capacity in the context of heterogeneous networks where cells of different types coexist. Due to the different transmit powers between the macro and small cells, interference levels are also different. Since the small cells are densely deployed, fully connected interference network between small cells is considered in this paper. The proposed algorithm performs the selection of a stream sequence among a predetermined set of sequences. Those selected sequences are the ones that mostly contribute to the sum rate when performing the exhaustive search. As a consequence, since the search space is reduced, the complexity is significantly decreased. These stream sequences form a regular structure where the first stream is associated to a pico user. Another distinguishing property of the proposed approach is that the stream sequences include at least one stream for each user. When selecting the streams, the channel matrices of the unselected streams are projected orthogonally to the virtual transmit and virtual receive channels of the selected stream in order to align the interference in the null space of these virtual channels. The performance evaluations are carried out by considering different scenarios with different numbers and locations of pico cells. It is shown that the proposed method can significantly reduce the computational complexity while achieving a very close performance to the exhaustive search.",['spi']
Fatigue performance evaluation of a Nickel-free titanium-based alloy for biomedical application - Effect of thermomechanical treatments,"In the present work, structural fatigue experiments were performed on a Ti-26Nb alloy subjected to different thermomechanical treatments: a severe cold rolling, a solution treatment and two aging treatments at low-temperature conducted after cold rolling in order to optimize the kinetics of precipitation. The aim is to investigate the effect of microstructural refinement obtained by these processes on fatigue performances. Preliminary tensile tests were performed on each state and analyzed in terms of the microstructure documented by using X-Ray diffraction and TEM analysis. These tests clearly promote the short-time-aged cold-rolled state with a fine α and ω phases precipitation. An interesting balance between mechanical properties such as high strength and low Young's modulus has been obtained. Cyclic bending tests were carried out in air at 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3% imposed strain amplitudes. At low straining amplitude, where the fatigue performances are at their best, the cold-rolled state does not break at 3×10E6 cycles and the long-time aged precipitation hardened state seems to be a good competitor compared to the cold-rolled state. All failure characteristics are documented by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs and analyzed in term of microstructure.","['sdv', 'spi']"
Mechanical properties of a nanoporous membrane used in implantable medical devices. Correlation between experimental characterization and 2D numerical simulation,"Nanoporous membranes are used for the elaboration of implantable medical devices. In order to guaranty their integrity after implantation in a patient body, it is necessary to characterize the microstructure and the mechanical behavior of such membranes. They present randomly distributed pores around 1 µm in diameter at the surface. X-ray nanotomography permits to get the geometry of the pores through the thickness with a reduction of the diameter in the core. A multiscale study is done to characterize the membranes: macroscopic tensile tests permit to get the behavior law of the non porous material and in situ tensile tests are carried on in a Scanning Electron Microscope in order to observe the evolution of pores and cracks during loading. A 2D Finite Element Model is also developed in parallel. The confrontation between experiments and numerical simulations permit to validate the accuracy of the model. The latter is then used to simulate several types of loadings considering various pore distributions and sizes.","['sdv', 'spi']"

Profiling oil-water flows in microchannel: preliminary results using Optical Feedback Interferometry,We study oil-water flows in a Y-shaped rectangular cross-section microreactor with different parameters at each inlet. A theoretical model based on a Couette flow approximation is proposed and Navier-Stokes equation is solved for the relative movement in between oil and water plates. The model is further validated with preliminary measurements for flow profile reconstruction using optical feedback interferometry. The proposed method shows potential applications in assessment of immiscible flowing fluids,"['spi', 'phys']"
Analysis of X-Band SAR Sea-Clutter Distributions at Different Grazing Angles,"Modeling sea clutter is a difficult problem due to the interaction of the sea surface characteristics (wind speed and wind direction), the geometry of acquisition (grazing angle and azimuth angle), and radar parameters (frequency, polarization, and resolution). In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, the effect of coherent averaging and motion from the sea will also influence the statistics. An accurate description of the sea surface amplitude probability density function is important for robust target detection. The goal of this paper is to identify a common distribution which matches two different airborne SAR X-band data sets obtained from different locales and at different grazing angles. The first data set was collected by the French Aerospace Laboratory (ONERA) SETHI radar off the coast of France, at low grazing angles (3° and 10°). The second is the Ingara medium grazing angle (15°–45°) sea clutter data set collected by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation off the coast of Australia. In this paper, a number of recently developed distributions are considered, including the K+Rayleigh and Pareto+noise, both of which account for thermal noise. To measure the effectiveness of the model fit, the Bhattacharyya distance and the threshold error are computed with particular attention given to the tail region, where the threshold is determined in a detection scenario.",['spi']
A Psychophysical Investigation of Size as a Physical Variable,"Physical visualizations, or data physicalizations, encode data in attributes of physical shapes. Despite a considerable body of work on visual variables, "" physical variables "" remain poorly understood. One of them is physical size. A difficulty for solid elements is that "" size "" is ambiguous – it can refer to either length/diameter, surface, or volume. Thus, it is unclear for designers of physicalizations how to effectively encode quantities in physical size. To investigate, we ran an experiment where participants estimated ratios between quantities represented by solid bars and spheres. Our results suggest that solid bars are compared based on their length, consistent with previous findings for 2D and 3D bars on flat media. But for spheres, participants' estimates are rather proportional to their surface. Depending on the estimation method used, judgments are rather consistent across participants, thus the use of perceptually-optimized size scales seems possible. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of data physicalizations and the need for more empirical studies on physical variables.",['info']
‘Black Boxes’ and ‘fracture points’: the regulation of gender equality in the UK and French construction industries,"Gender equality was a founding principle of the European Union (EU) and has remained on its policy agenda ever since, yet delivery of policy goals has been uneven across countries and economic sectors. We draw on theoretical and empirical literatures from human resource management and policy science to explore EU gender equality initiatives and their enactment within one sector which has seen virtually no improvements in gender-based employment equality: construction. To help understand the possible reasons for this, we compare practice and experiences in two countries; the UK and France. In both, the construction industry remains resolutely male-dominated, with women employed primarily in support and administrative roles. We deploy the concept of Europeanisation, to provide an analytical framework to understand the potential gaps between policy goals and on-the-ground implementation, whilst a comparative approach allows us to see if different national approaches to EU policy implementation can help explain these policy failures. We identify three potential ‘fracture points’ where breaks in policy transmission and enactment may occur: between the EU and national levels; between the national and industry levels; and within the industry itself. We identify areas for further research, where unpacking the ‘Black Boxes’ of policy development and industry practices, can help more effective policy-targeting to deliver policy goals on gender equality.",['shs']
Housing and ageing in France and Germany: the intergenerational solution,"Purpose – In France and Germany, intergenerational housing is put forward as an option by public authorities. This kind of housing scheme seems like a good solution for seniors and young people, from both an economic and a social point of view. But beyond this common philosophy, there are differences in the way intergenerational housing is being implemented in the two countries. France mainly favours the studentsenior home-sharing model whereas the intergenerational collaborative housing (co-housing) model based on solidarity between seniors and families is gaining ground in Germany. The purpose of this paper is to explore the reasons for these differences and present results from field surveys conducted in both countries. Design/methodology/approach – The qualitative methodology of the field surveys consisted essentially of semi-structured interviews with the young people and seniors living in these types of housing, in order to understand how they experienced intergenerational solidarity. Findings – The authors’ surveys revealed that certain conditions are essential for this intergenerational solidarity to be fully effective, notably voluntary participation and commitment to the project, and possibly external support to ensure that it is designed and implemented in the best possible way. Originality/value – This paper provides useful recommendations for decision makers who wish to support this type of housing concept based on intergenerational solidarity.",['shs']
Folding optimal polygons from squares,"What is the largest regular n-gon that fits in a unit square? Can it be folded from a square piece of paper using standard moves from origami? Answering the first question is relatively easy, using simple ideas from geometry. The second is more interesting; our answer illustrates the difference between origami and the standard compass-and-straightedge constructions of the Greeks, where, for instance, the 7-gon cannot be constructed. Not only can we fold a 7-gon, but we can fold the largest one possible from a given square piece of paper.

X-ray Diffraction Residual Stress Measurement at Room Temperature and 77 K in a Microelectronic Multi-layered Single-Crystal Structure Used for Infrared Detection,"The electronic assembly considered in this study is an infrared (IR) detector consisting of different layers, including (111) CdHgTe and (100) silicon single crystals. The processing steps and the low working temperature (77 K) induce thermomechanical stresses that can affect the reliability of the thin and brittle CdHgTe detection circuit and lead to failure. These residual stresses have been quantified in both CdHgTe and silicon circuits at room temperature (293 K) and cryogenic temperature using x-ray diffraction. A specific experimental device has been developed for 77 K measurements and a method developed for single-crystal analysis has been adapted to such structures using a laboratory four-circle diffractometer. This paper describes the methodology to obtain the deformed lattice parameter and compute the strain/ stress tensors. Whereas the stresses in the CdHgTe layer appear to be negative at room temperature (compressive values), cryogenic measurements show a tensile biaxial stress state of about 30 MPa and highlight the great impact of low temperature on the mechanical properties.",['spi']
Modeling of a Complex-Shaped Underwater Vehicle for Robust Control Scheme,"The two critical issues of robust control are stable controller synthesis and control performance guarantee in the presence of model uncertainties. Inside all robust stable solutions, small modeling parametric uncertainties lead to better performance controllers. However, the cost to develop an accurate hydrodynamic model, which shrinks the uncertainty intervals, is usually high. Meanwhile, when the robot geometry is complex, it becomes very difficult to identify its dynamic and hydrodynamic parameters. In this paper, the main objective is to find an efficient modeling approach to tune acceptable control design models. A control-oriented modeling approach is proposed for a low-speed semi-AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) CISCREA, which has complexshaped structures. The proposed solution uses cost efficient CFD (computational fluid dynamic) software to predict the two hydrodynamic key parameters: The added mass matrix and the damping matrix. Four DOF (degree of freedom) model is built for CISCREA from CFD and verified through experimental results. Numerical and experimental results are compared. In addition, rotational damping CFD solutions are studied using STAR-CCM+TM. A nonlinear compensator is demonstrated to tune linear yaw model for robust control scheme.",['spi']
Study of the interaction between a Zirconium thin film and an EN C100 steel substrate: temperature effect,"Zirconium thin films were grown on high carbon steel substrates EN C100 (1 %wt. of carbon) by RF magnetron sputtering. In order to study the reactivity of the film/substrate system as a function of the temperature, one hour vacuum annealing was carried out for different temperatures between 600°C and 1100°C. The films were then analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) and nanoindentation. The obtained results showed a progressive transformation of zirconium film to zirconium carbide. Carbon atoms diffusion from substrate toward the film induced this transformation. The sample annealed at 900°C exhibited the best mechanicals properties (H =17 GPa and E = 220 GPa). Samples treated at higher temperature were affected by oxidation and high microporosity. Even if the conversion is uncomplete, annealing significantly promotes adhesion of the film on the substrate.",['spi']
Critical angles in DC magnetron glad thin films,"The objective of this study is to examine the sudden drop in properties of aluminum, titanium and chromium thin films prepared by the glancing angle deposition method. The thin films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering under identical deposition conditions. A substrate-holder with seven different orientations with respect to the target normal was used. The thickness and the column tilt angles (β) of the thin films were determined by scanning electron microscopy. The residual stress of the thin films was evaluated using the wafer curvature technique and calculated by the Stoney's formula. The thickness variation and column tilt angle versus the orientation of the substrate indicated that the critical point is around 60° for all metallic materials and a critical angle of 60° is also found for the residual stress. Simulations of the particles transport are compared to the experimental data and moderate the critical angles analyses.","['spi', 'phys']"
The influence of the pressure on the microstructure of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films deposited by dual magnetron sputtering,"Mixed oxide thin films, such as yttria-stabilized zirconia, deposited by dual reactive magnetron sputtering on a non-rotating substrate show a typical microstructure of bended, or tilted columns. Two effects define the tilt. The first effect is the compositional gradient over each column which results in a different lattice spacing. To accommodate this difference, the column bends. As such, the chemical composition has a major influence on the final columnar tilt. The second effect is ballistic shadowing which is controlled by the pressure-distance product. At higher pressure-distances, this second effect plays a more prominent role, and a different behaviour of the columnar tilt as a function of the film composition is noticed. The experimental trends can be understood by the use of a particle trajectory code which provides the angular and energy distribution of the atoms to a ballistic aggregation Monte Carlo code simulating the resulting microstructure.","['spi', 'phys']"
The Brasilia Experiment: The Heterogeneous Impact of Road Access on Spatial Development in Brazil,"This paper studies the impact of the rapid expansion of the Brazilian road network, which occurred from the 1960s to the 2000s, on the growth and spatial allocation of population and economic activity across the country's municipalities. It addresses the problem of endogeneity in infrastructure location by using an original empirical strategy, based on the ""historical natural experiment"" constituted by the creation of the new federal capital city Brasília in 1960. The results reveal a dual pattern, with improved transport connections increasing concentration of economic activity and population around the main centers in the South of the country, while spurring the emergence of secondary economic centers in the less developed North, in line with predictions in terms of agglomeration economies. Over the period, roads are shown to account for half of pcGDP growth and to spur a significant decrease in spatial inequality.",['shs']
"Four challenges in the field of alternative, radical and citizens’ media research","In January 1994 the Zapatista movement in southern Mexico inaugurated a new era of media use for dissent. Since that time, an array of dissenting collectives and individuals have appropriated media technologies in order to make their voices heard or to articulate alternative identities. From Zapatista media to the Arab Spring, social movements throughout the world are taking over, hybridizing, recycling, and adapting media technologies. This new era poses a new set of challenges for academics and researchers in the field of Communication for Social Change (CfSC). Based on examples from Mexico, Lebanon, and Colombia, this article highlights and discusses four such research challenges: accounting for historical context; acknowledging the complexity of communication processes; anchoring analysis in a political economy of information and communication technologies; and positioning new research in relation to existing knowledge and literature within the field of communication and social change.",['shs']
Effect of electrodeposition duration on the morphological and structural modification of the flower-like nanostructured ZnO,"Flower-like morphology of ZnO thin films were successfully electrodeposited via a one-step route only by changing electrodeposition duration and potential at a fixed concentration on n-Si (100) in 78.10(-4) M Zn(NO3)(2), 6H(2)O and 0.1 M KNO3 solution at 70 degrees C without using any catalyst, additives or seed layer. The as electrodeposited products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy and photoluminescence. The effects of the electrodeposition potential and duration on the morphology, structure and photoluminescence properties were studied. The results show that the product morphology changes with a change in the applied voltage and electrodeposition duration. Well defined shape of flower-like ZnO morphology was generated under the limited conditions of -1.2 V for 60 min, with (002) preferred orientation. Strong UV emission is obtained in the case of ZnO flower like morphology electrodeposited at -1.2 V for 60 min. The band-gap energy value of ZnO flower-like, determined from optical reflectance spectra, is 3.37 eV. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",['chim']
"Do preferences to reduce health risks related to air pollution depend on illness type? Evidence from a choice experiment in Beijing, China","This study elicits preferences for clean air in a fast-developing context with increasing regulatory efforts and widespread adoption of self-protection measures against air pollution. We examine whether willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce mortality and morbidity risk depends on the type of illness caused by the pollution. Three major illnesses attributable to air pollution are examined in a choice experiment in Beijing, China. We find robust evidence, testing for both observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity, that WTP does not vary by illness type, and hence, that WTP for policy purposes should not be differentiated based on illness type. We also find that income, education, gender and other factors related with risk vulnerability well predict self-protection, and that respondents who engage more in self-protection have stronger preferences for public interventions. Our results suggest a value of a statistical life (VSL) and value of a statistical illness (VSI) of RMB 5.54 million (USD 1.58 million) and RMB 0.82 million (USD 0.23 million), which are higher than earlier estimates in China. This imply that for societies with strong economic growth and significant pollution, VSL and VSI are likely to increase rapidly, further strengthening the role of policies on pollution control and public health.",['shs']
A review about the effects of structural and operational factors on the gigacycle fatigue of steels,"It is well‐known that the high cycle fatigue (HCF) strength of steel components is influenced by a lot of factors depending on both material, loading (including environment), specimen or component geometry (design), and manufacturing process. Based on a literature review of a lot of experimental data, a synthesis is proposed in this paper to discuss the effect of the structural and operational factors on the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) characteristics of steels. HCF and VHCF regimes are distinguished in terms of failure mechanisms and S‐N curve shapes for high and low strength steels. Then, the effect of the microstructural and mechanical features on the VHCF resistance is debated as different parameters (microstructure, inclusion size type and depth, hydrogen, environment, maximum tensile strength, and residual stresses). Next, the influence of the loading conditions is addressed by taking into account both the frequency effect, the highly stressed volume, the loading type, and loading ratio. Finally, the influence of the testing techniques used in VHCF experiments is discussed.",['spi']
The effect of mean stress and stress biaxiality in high-cycle fatigue,"This article presents a review of selected multiaxial high-cycle fatigue criteria with an emphasis on their ability to take into account the mean stress effect and the effect of a biaxial stress state. It is shown that the predictions of the various criteria are very different for the case of biaxial tensile loads. This is in contrast to the case of combined tension-torsion loads, where the predictions are very similar. The second part of the article investigates which mechanical parameter (eg, the hydrostatic stress or the normal stress) is the most appropriate to take into account these cyclic stress states.",['spi']
Fatigue crack initiation and growth in a 35CrMo4 steel investigated by infrared thermography,The present work is devoted to the investigation of fatigue crack initiation and growth in middle-cycle fatigue (∼105 cycles). Smooth specimens made of 35CrMo4 quenched and tempered steel were loaded in fully reversed plane bending. Temperature field evolution in time was recorded with an infrared camera. The experimental results show that the local heating of metal under fatigue loading is a sensitive and accurate enough manifestation of small fatigue crack initiation. It is shown that the time evolution of the spatial standard deviation of the temperature field can be used to investigate the damage localization and to monitor both the crack initiation and the current location of the fatigue crack tip. This should help to investigate the behaviour of defect during cyclic loading.,['spi']
"Analysis and possible estimation of keyhole depths evolution, using laser operating parameters and material properties","The authors propose an analysis of the effect of various operating parameters on the keyhole depth during laser welding. The authors have developed a model that uses the analysis of the thermal field obtained in 2D geometry, which is mainly defined by the characteristic Peclet number. This allows us to show that the dependence of the aspect ratio R of the keyhole with the operating parameters of the process is a function of two parameters: a normalized aspect ratio R0, controlled by the incident laser power and the spot diameter, and a characteristic speed V0 related to the process of heat diffusion. The resulting general law R = f (R0, V/V0) appears to be very well verified by different experimental data and allows to define mean thermophysical parameters of the used materials. These data can then be used for keyhole depths prediction for any subsequent operating parameters of the same material. This model also allows us to define precisely a criterion for a keyhole threshold generation. The authors will apply the derived procedure to successfully analyze experiments on materials with very different thermophysical properties (such as steel alloys and copper), with various focal spots, incident laser powers, and welding speeds.",['spi']
Experimental Investigation on the Significance of the Conventional Endurance Limit of a Spheroidal Graphite Cast Iron,"Fatigue tests were performed on a spheroidal graphite cast iron in four point plane bending under constant stress amplitude and block loading conditions. The microstructure of this material has a ‘bull’s eyes’ appearance, i.e. the spheroids of graphite are surrounded by ferrite and these nodules and ferrite zones are included in a pearlitic matrix. Scanning electronic microscope observations were carried out at different fractions of life for constant stress amplitude loadings above and below the conventional endurance limit. Non-propagating micro-cracks were observed at a stress level equal to the conventional endurance limit. These observations showed that another limit can be defined below the conventional endurance one, i.e. one below which micro-cracks were not observed to initiate in the matrix. These cracks were found to arrest at the ferrite/pearlite interface when the material was tested below this new limit. This concept was used to rationalize fatigue results from tests with loading in blocks above and below the conventional endurance limit.",['spi']
A non-local theory applied to high cycle multiaxial fatigue,"The stress gradient effect on the fatigue limit is an important factor which has to be taken into account for an efficient transfer of fatigue data from laboratory tests to design of industrial components. A short review of some multiaxial high cycle fatigue criteria considering this effect is presented. On the basis of the two local mesoscopic approaches of Papadopoulos, two new non-local high cycle multiaxial fatigue criteria are developed. These proposals are based on the concept of volume influencing fatigue crack initiation. Their predictions are compared with experimental multiaxial fatigue data on four materials (a mild steel, two high strength steels and a spheroidal graphite cast iron). The accuracy of the two local Papadopoulos criteria and of the non-local proposals are compared and discussed together with the physical interpretation of the threshold defining the volume influencing fatigue crack initiation.",['spi']
Influence of the microstructure and voids on the high-cycle fatigue strength of 316L stainless steel under multiaxial loading,"In the present study, the effects of both the microstructure and voids on the high-cycle fatigue behaviour of the 316L austenitic stainless steel are investigated by using finite element simulations of polycrystalline aggregates. The numerical analysis relies on a metallurgical and mechanical characterization. In particular, fatigue tests are carried out to estimate the fatigue limits at 2.106 cycles under uniaxial and multiaxial loading conditions (combined tension and torsion and biaxial tension) using both smooth specimens and specimens containing an artificial hemispherical defect. The simulations are carried out with several configurations of crystalline orientations in order to take into account the variability of the microstructure in the predictions of the macroscopic fatigue limits. These predictions are obtained, thanks to a probabilistic fatigue criterion using the finite element results. The capability of this criterion to predict the influence of voids on the average and the scatter of macroscopic fatigue limits is evaluated.",['spi']

Thermal analysis in Ti-6Al-4V drilling,"Ti-6Al-4V is commonly used especially in aerospace and biomedical industries. This alloy is known as a difficult-to-cut material. Due to its poor thermal properties, the heat generated during machining processes traps near material deformation zones. This causes detrimental high temperatures for the cutting tools. This article combines the analytical and FEM modeling techniques to estimate the temperature evolution of carbide tools in Ti-6Al-4V drilling. In this article, a novel thermocouple based temperature measurement setup is also introduced. Moreover, the simulated and measured temperatures under various cutting conditions for the drilling of Ti-6Al-4V are presented for the validation.",['spi']
A new route for semi-solid steel forging,"Forging in semi-solid state significantly extends the possibilities of classical hot forging. In order to fully exploit its potential, the process requires a specific and demanding environment, penalizing its industrial deployment. In this context, an alternative route is proposed. In the proposed process, semi-solid zones at the heart of the material coexist with surrounding solid zones within the part. The outcome is an optimized process where the benefits of thixoforging are reached at a significant extent within the classical process framework of hot forging. The paper investigates this proposal up to a full-scale proof-of concept in an industrial setting.",['spi']
Prediction of surface integrity using Flamant-Boussinesq analytical model,"Surface integrity prediction of hard machining using PCBN cutting tools remains a major topic for many high value added applications. A Flamant–Boussinesq (FB) analytical model has initially been applied for surface integrity prediction in orthogonal cutting. In order to extend this model to the general case of 3D cutting process, a cutting force model was developed and incorporated into the FB model. This one was then used to evaluate the plastically deformed layer thickness induced by 3D round cutting tools. It was validated by comparing the predicted plastic strains with the micro hardness distribution induced by 3D cutting tests.",['spi']

Toward a More Equitable Use of Resources,"“Equitable’’ means “dealing fairly and equally with all concerned” [1]. The concerned parties are all current and future stakeholders related to natural resources use, which means not only those diretcly involved in breeding, harvesting or extractive activities, but every human on Earth, as the ways natural resources are used have far reaching implications on biodiversity, climate, environmental and human health, and from there on the world’s future. It also implicitly means that there is a return, a benefit, to share. Further to the impetus of globalisation, resource use activities are no longer limited to the sole satisfaction of the needs of local communities. They are the initial stage of industrial activities that can be located thousands of kilometres away from the site where the resources were harvested or extracted. Using natural capital to turn it into other forms of capital, such as built, social or financial capital can provide benefits that last for generations, well beyond the end of the actual resource using activity. It can also generate negative legacies that can have negative impacts for centuries. How these benefits and negative impacts are distributed is central to equity. Industrial-scale resource use activities in agriculture, cattle rearing, forestry, water supply or mining, involve a wide range of stakeholders. Each one has specific, more often than not conflicting interests in the way the resource is used and the returns or services expected from the resource use. These stakeholders can comprise companies, their suppliers and the downstream supply chains depending on their products and/or services, the consumers that will purchase the goods and services derived from the use of these resources, employees, unions, the local communities impacted by the activities, authorities, media, academia and research, international organisation, banks and insurance companies, NGOs. Nature, the silent stakeholder, is frequently forgotten here, while it provides the resources at the heart of most economic activities as well as essential life-supporting services. Without a healthy, well-functioning ecosystem at global and local scale lasting wealth generation is impossible. There is a nexus of natural resources, whereby tha vailability and quality o one resource, for instance water, has an impact of the availability of another one, for instance minerals and metals. The world faces severe resources constraints due to demographic growth, urbanisation and the development of a large global middle-class (+3 bn people between 2009-2030 [2] with resource-intensive lifestyles. Unsustainable resources use practices are widespread. This makes absolute decoupling [3] between growth, which is needed to foster social well-being, and the diverse negative impacts of growth an absolute must. In such a context humanity needs to re-think the way it uses natural resources and how the benefits are shared form an intra- and intergenerational perspective. Based on the work of the UNEP International Resource Panel the issues and the way forward will be outlined, with a special focus on mineral resources, governance issues and developing countries.

"Vers un permis de conduire progressif en Europe : revue de la littérature sur les pratiques et leurs effets, et recommandation pour un modèle idéalImplementing graduated driving license in Europe: literature review on practices and effects, and recommendation of an ideal model","Graduated Driving License (GDL) systems are since many decades applied in the USA, Canada, Australia and New‐Zealand. GDL‐systems traditionally include three phases. During the first “supervised learning” phase the learner driver can only drive a vehicle when accompanied by an experienced driver. This allows experiencing different traffic situations while being supervised. In the second “autonomous practicing” phase the learner driver can drive alone on the road but under strict restrictions, like no driving at night or with passengers of the same age. This allows automating some driving abilities while avoiding specific situations with increased risk. In the third phase one has a full driving license without restrictions, although sometimes more severe sanctions are foreseen. The idea behind GDL is allowing learner drivers to gain driving experience gradually and with less exposure to risky traffic situations. The main idea behind is “learning through experience”. Although European systems traditionally focus on “learning through (professional) instruction”, an increased attention for the GDL‐approach is seen the last decennia. This is related to the increased opinion that learning to drive safely in traffic does require a long learning time and much practice, and this also goes along with insights on higher order driver educational goals (Goals for Driver Education matrix–GDE). This article synthesizes recent literature on effectiveness of GDL‐systems as well as on current tendencies in Europe that approach the GDL‐structure. Recommendations are formulated and an ideal structure for category BDes systèmes de permis de conduire par étape (Graduated Driving License- GDL) sont appliqués depuis des décennies aux États-Unis, au Canada, en Australie et en Nouvelle-Zélande. Ces systèmes GDL comprennent habituellement trois phases. Au cours de la première phase (d’apprentissage), le candidat-conducteur peut uniquement conduire un véhicule s’il est accompagné d’un conducteur expérimenté, ce qui lui permet de vivre différentes situations de trafic en étant supervisé. Durant la deuxième phase (pratique indépendante), le candidat-conducteur peut conduire seul dans la circulation mais sous certaines restrictions strictes : il ne peut par exemple pas conduire la nuit ni accompagné de passagers du même âge. Cette phase permet au conducteur d’automatiser certaines capacités de conduite tout en évitant des situations spécifiques comportant un risque accru. Pendant la troisième phase, l’on dispose d’un permis de conduire sans restriction même si des sanctions plus sévères sont prévues dans certains cas. Le système GDL a pour but de permettre aux candidats-conducteurs d’acquérir progressivement de l’expérience de conduite tout en étant moins exposés aux situations de trafic à risque. L’idée derrière ce concept est d’ « apprendre par l’expérience ». Bien que des systèmes européens se concentrent généralement sur un « apprentissage au travers d’instructions (professionnelles) », l’on a observé une attention accrue pour les approches GDL au cours des dernières décennies. Ceci est dû à l’opinion croissante selon laquelle apprendre à conduire dans la circulation en toute sécurité requiert une longue période d’apprentissage et beaucoup de pratique. Par ailleurs, ceci correspond également aux points de vue concernant les objectifs de niveau supérieur pour la formation des conducteurs (matrice Goals for Driver Education- GDE). Cette étude synthétise la littérature récente sur l’efficacité des systèmes GDL et sur les tendances actuelles observées en Europe concernant la structure GDL. Des recommandations ont été formulées et une structure idéale pour la catégorie B (voiture) formation des conducteurs a été proposée.",['shs']

Local FMC and high resolution sensors,"In order to have a local scale estimation of vegetation water status and to have a more precise water stress mapping of some areas, NOAA AVHRR data are no more adequate and one has to rely on high resolution satellite. Two types of high resolution data have shown some utility for fuel moisture assessment in previous studies and have been tested during the MEGAFIRES project : Landsat Thematic Mapper data and multi-temporal ERS-1 or ERS-2 SAR images. The low temporal repetitivity of these data (twice a month) does not allow to provide daily or weekly fire risk estimations as it would be necessary from an operational point of view. However, their interest is to give fuel moisture content estimations at a scale that is more comparable to the ground measurement ones (approximately 100 meters) and they could be of some use to test the effects of change of scale in the correlation derived from NOAA-AVHRR.",['sde']
New development in low-field NMR for the characterisation of food microstructure,"Fats are present in most food products and they have a significant importance for fat-containing products such as chocolate and butter. The physical properties of fats depend on the polymorphic behaviour and inter-solubility of their major triacylglycerol components and the phase behaviour of these mixtures is of paramount importance for the food industry. Indeed, fat structures formed by their crystals determine the functional properties of fat-containing products such as their texture, plasticity and morphology. DSC and XRD are the two techniques generally used to characterise fats. Crystal size is another important parameter for determining the physical properties of fats because it affects the rheological properties and consequently modifies taste, graininess and texture.",['sde']

"Large complexes: Cloning strategy, production and purification","Membrane proteins can assemble and form complexes in the cell envelope. In Gram-negative bacteria, a number of multiprotein complexes including secretion systems, efflux pumps, molecular motors or pilus assembly machines comprise proteins from the inner and the outer membrane. Beside the structures of isolated soluble domains, only few atomic structures of these assembled molecular machines have been elucidated. To better understand the function and to solve the structure of protein complexes, it is thus necessary to design dedicated production and purification processes.

Radioactive isotopes produced for medical applications: setting up an accurate measurement method for production cross sectionIsotopes radioactifs produits pour des applications médicales : mise en place d'une méthode de mesure précise de sections efficaces de production.,"The nuclear medicine is a medical specialty that uses radionuclides for diagnosis or therapy. Several modalities are used in diagnosis (PET/SPECT, Positron Emission Tomography/Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) which takes advantage of the photon emissions occurring during the decay of the radionuclide. In therapy, strongly interacting particles obtained through the radioactive decay are used such as alpha, beta or Auger electrons. They mostly used coupled to a vector for targeted therapy. The trend followed by nuclear medicine is to become more and more personalized to each patient. To reach that goal, a wide variety of radionuclides (different decay particles, different half-lives, different chemical properties) must be available to meet the patient’s need. Their production is achieved using reactor or accelerator and has to be well controlled. The aim of this PhD thesis is to study the production means of radionuclides having an interest for medicine using an accelerator. To do that, a good knowledge of the radionuclide production cross section is required. In collaboration with the GIP ARRONAX[1] which possesses a multi-particle high energy cyclotron, the project is to get an accurate measurement of production cross sections for a wide variety of radionuclides but also explore alternative production route and assess the final product quality. To measure cross sections, the “stacked-foils” technique is used. Among the information requires for a precise measurement, the flux of the incident particle is the more important one. The data about the particle flux of the beam can be evaluated using a monitor reaction with a well-known cross section whose values are recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The uncertainty (around 10%) associated to the monitor cross section values results in a high uncertainty on the measured ones. Another method is to measure the amount of charges crossing the stack. This method allows reducing the uncertainty on the measured cross section (expected uncertainties are of the order of few percents). In order to use this technique, a new experimental cross section measurement device has been set up and is being tested in well-known conditions. The results obtained show that the new device works well and the results are in good agreement with the IAEA recommended cross section values and other available data in the literature. This satisfying results show that device can be used to measure cross section and it will allow tocomplete production cross section data base for radionuclides of interest.

HISTORY & MATHEMATICS Political Demography & Global Ageing,"Among different important issues, which are discussed in Political Demography the issue of global ageing becomes more and more pressing every year. It is sufficient to take into account the point that within two forthcoming decades a rapid global increase in the number of retirement-age persons will lead to its doubling within this fairly small historical period. The concerns about population ageing apply to both developed and many developing countries and it has turned into a global issue. In forthcoming decades the population ageing is likely to become one of the most important processes determining the future society characteristics and the direction of technological development. The present volume of the Yearbook (which is the fifth in the series) is subtitled ‘Political Demography & Global Ageing’. It brings together a number of interesting articles by scholars from Europe, Asia, and America. They examine global ageing from a variety of perspectives. This issue of the Yearbook consists of two main sections: (I) Aspects of Political Demography; (II) Facing Population Ageing. We hope that this issue will be interesting and useful both for historians and mathematicians, as well as for all those dealing with various social and natural sciences.",['shs']
GLOBALISTICS AND GLOBALIZATION STUDIES Global Transformations and Global Future,"The present volume is the fifth in the series of yearbooks with the title Globalistics and Globalization Studies. The subtitle of the present volume is Global Transformations and Global Future. We become more and more accustomed to think globally and to see global processes. And our future can all means be global. However, is this statement justified? Indeed, in recent years, many have begun to claim that globalization has stalled, that we are rather dealing with the process of anti-globalization. Will not we find ourselves at some point again in an edifice spanning across the globe, but divided into national apartments, separated by walls of high tariffs and mutual suspicion? Of course, some setbacks are always possible, because the process of globalization cannot develop smoothly. It is a process which is itself emerging from contradictions and is shaped by a new contradiction. They often go much further than underlying systemic changes allow. They break forward, as the vanguard of a victorious army, and then often meet resistance of various social and political forces and may suddenly start to roll back just at the moment when everyone expects their further offensive. We believe that this is what is happening with globalization at present. The yearbook will be interesting to a wide range of researchers, teachers, students and all those who are concerned about global issues.",['shs']

EEVEE : the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment,"Empathy is a multifaceted emotional and mental faculty that is often found to be affected in a great number of psychopathologies, such as schizophrenia, yet it remains very difficult to measure in an ecological context. The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar's behavior to the observer's neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar's face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. This innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in various populations, notably individuals suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders.","['info', 'shs']"
Refinement of Knowledge Sharing Platforms to Promote Effective Use: A Use Case,"This work focuses on the improvement of a line of corporate knowledge management systems, knowledge repositories. For the implementation of such systems, companies can deploy important means for small gains. Indeed, management services often notice very limited use compared to what they actually expect. We present a use case of a five-step redesigning user-centered approach that combines a top-down content architecture, integration with other corporate information systems and adapted interfaces and interactions design to increase the use of these artifacts. Our implementation is done on the knowledge repository used by operators from Société du Canal de Provence (SCP), a French water management company. Their system was taken into production but very occasionally used. We describe the reasons for this limited use and we propose a design methodology adapted to the context. Promoting the effective use of the system, our approach has been experimented and evaluated with a panel of users working at SCP. Results of our semi-structured questionnaire reveal that more than half of the participant are satisfied and present a positive attitude towards the redesigned system.",['info']

Design of a spatial database to analyze the forms and responsiveness of an urban environment using an ontological approach,"This paper introduces a spatial database and ontology-enabled framework that models and operationalizes the relation between urban forms and their responsiveness to the needs of its user. The objective is to offer a framework that provides a practical implementation of the concept of responsive environment introduced by Bentley, Alcock, Murrain, McGlynn and Smith (1985) in order to provide enough reusability and flexibility to reflect different urban modeling viewpoints and conceptualizations. The developed system is organized in three modules: the first and second modules model the ontology of a responsive environment and the layout of an urban environment while the third module is a spatial database that supports further computational analysis of urban forms. We applied several spatial data metrics that analyze the structural properties of urban forms and the emerging opportunities as identified by the notion of responsive environments. The framework is experimented and applied to the district 12, region 4 of the city of Tehran in Iran. The modeling abstractions lead to the generation of several semantic bridge rules and map layers that reflect different levels of urban responsiveness. The emerging patterns are qualitatively evaluated and found to be correlated with inhabitants' own perception of an urban environment. The results show that the suggested framework can be applied to the analysis of the responsive environments of urban forms.","['info', 'sde']"
Kondratieff Waves. Juglar – Kuznets – Kondratieff. Yearbook,"In the period from the 1920s to 1930s the theory of economic cycles underwent dramatic changes. Due to the research of such famous economists as Nikolay Kondratieff, Joseph Kitchin, Wesley Mitchell, Simon Kuznets, and Joseph Schumpeter the idea of a whole system of economic cycles (with characteristic periods between two and sixty years) was developed. The idea of a system of intertwined economic cycles is nowadays paramount to the school of evolutionary economics and its development promises rather interesting future outcomes. That is why this issue of our ‘Kondratieff Waves’ Yearbook is devoted to the interconnections between various economic cycles. As to the subtitle of this volume, one should note that many of the contributors refer to the system of cycles and the fact that real economic cycles make up a system, whereas among different types of cycles, the Juglar, Kuznets, and Kondratieff cycles are the most important ones for the present-day economic dynamics. Although Kondratieff himself considered long waves as above all an economic phenomenon, the theory of the long waves became, however, very actively developed in connection with their political and geopolitical aspects. In this Yearbook, the political aspect of Kondratieff waves is the subject of several articles in the second section. The last section of this Yearbook is devoted to the heritage of Kondratieff and other prominent economists. The year 2015 marks the 150th anniversary of the outstanding Russian economist, one of the most prominent researchers of medium-term economic cycles, Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, and the volume is concluded with Kondratieff's article about him. Concerning 2015, we should mention another anniversary, namely, 30 years since the death of Simon Kuznets (1901–1985). This edition will be useful for economists, social scientists, as well as for a wide range of those interested in the problems of the past, present, and future of global economy and globalization.",['shs']
GLOBALISTICS AND GLOBALIZATION STUDIES ASPECTS & DIMENSIONS OF GLOBAL VIEWS,"Nowadays globalization processes have become all-embracing. But at the same time, despite the ever-increasing flow of publications on globalization, our understanding and knowledge of it still leaves much to be desired. Especially it concerns the global processes in general, of which globalization is a part. We also need to systematize our ideas about globalization and Global Studies to somehow fit the realities. In particular, this concerns the education process, because the current state of education will determine the way people will perceive reality in the forthcoming decades. This yearbook aims at contributing to the solution of these important tasks. It is the third in the series of yearbooks titled Globalistics and Globalization Studies. This year it has the following subtitle: Aspects & Dimensions of Global Views. Its authors consider globalization and Global Studies in different dimensions and aspects: philosophical, methodological, and pedagogical, in terms of various processes, problems and perspectives. Of course, to some extent this means that this yearbook presents rather diverse materials. But globalization itself is very diverse. And its comprehension may proceed in the framework of different theoretical approaches and points of view. In the present yearbook one can find perceptions of globalization and Global Studies by a number of scholars from different countries of the world and learn rather peculiar visions of globalization by the Russian scientists and educators. The yearbook will be interesting to a wide range of researchers, teachers, students and all those who pay attention to global issues.",['shs']

The unique approach of Big History, the interdisciplinary genre of history that deals with the grand narrative of 13.8 billion years, has opened up a vast amount of research agendas. Big History brings together constantly updated information from the scientific disciplines and merges it with the contemplative realms of philosophy and the humanities. It also provides a connection between the past, present, and future. Big History is a colossal and extremely heterogeneous field of research encompassing all the forms of existence and all timescales. Unsurprisingly, Big History may be presented in very different aspects and facets. In this volume the Big History is presented and discussed in three different ways. In its first part, Big History is explored in terms of methodology, theories of knowledge, as well as showcasing the personal approach of scholars to Big History. The second section comprises such articles that could clarify Big History's main trends and laws. The third part of this book explores the nature of teaching Big History as well as profiling a number of educational methods. This volume will be useful both for those who study interdisciplinary macroproblems and for specialists working in focused directions, as well as for those who are interested in evolutionary issues of Astrophysics, Geology, Biology, History, Anthropology, Linguistics and other areas of study.",['shs']
Travaux de recherche internationaux sur la qualité sensorielle de la viande ovine et bovine,"Teagasc (Irish R&D institute in agriculture) hosted a United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) workshop focusing on eating quality, beef and lamb carcass grading to underpin consumer satisfaction and the implementation of UNECE standards. The workshop was also supported by Meat Livestock Australia (MLA). Prior to the workshop, scientists from six countries had decided to use MSA consumer testing protocols to develop a global DATAbank under the auspices of a Not for Profit Foundation established for this particular purpose. MLA offered to facilitate a data development project to ensure data compatibility. Consequently, a Foundation under the name, “International Meat Research 3G Foundation” had been established on June 12, 2017. The purpose of this foundation, in addition to hosting the data bank, is to add MSA (Meat Standard Australia) grading inputs and MSA consumer testing protocols to the research in eating quality worldwide.Le Teagasc (institut irlandais de recherche-développement en agriculture) a organisé un workshop de la Commission Economique des Nations Unies pour l’Europe (CEE-ONU) sur la qualité sensorielle de la viande et la classification des carcasses ovines et bovines pour une meilleure satisfaction des consommateurs et la diffusion des normes de la CEE-ONU. Ce workshop a également été soutenu par le “Meat Livestock Australia” (MLA). Avant le workshop, des scientifiques de six pays ont décidé d’utiliser les protocoles du système MSA (“Meat Standards Australia”) afin de construire une base de données internationale dans le cadre d’une association à but non lucratif créée pour cet objectif. Le MLA a proposé de faciliter ce projet afin d’assurer l’interopérabilité des données. Ainsi, une fondation nommée ""International Meat Research 3G Foundation” a été établie le 12 juin 2017. Son objectif est non seulement d’héberger la base de données, mais aussi de promouvoir au niveau mondial les protocoles du système MSA de classement des carcasses et d’évaluation sensorielle de la viande.",['sdv']
"The Quest for Statistical Significance: Ignorance, Bias and Malpractice of Research Practitioners","There is a growing body of evidence on the prevalence of ignorance, biases and malpractice among researchers which questions the authenticity, validity and integrity of the knowledge been propagated in professional circles. The push for academic relevance and career advancement have driven some research practitioners into committing gross misconduct in the form of innocent ignorance, sloppiness, malicious intent and outright fraud. These, among other concerns around research data handling and reporting, form the basis for this in-depth review. This discourse also draws attention to the recent official statement on the correct use of the p-value and the need for professional intervention is ensuring that the outcomes of research are neither erroneous nor misleading. The expositions in this review express cogent implications for institutions, supervisors, mentors, and editors to promote high ethical standards and rigor in scientific investigations.","['math', 'shs']"
How to Develop Indicators to Assess the Sustainability of Recycling Processes?,"The circular economy offers a partial answer to resource depletion. Recycling is inherent in the circular economy strategies that why industrial companies look for stepping recycling rates up. But recycling approaches are often motivated by economic considerations. Yet the recycling paths are multiple and it is important to determine the best path according to different categories of indicators and not only profit. We worked with MTB, an engineering and manufacturing company of recycling equipment. Our work aims to determine which are the most relevant indicators to assess the sustainability performance of recycling processes. We selected 8 indicators in 3 different categories: technical, environmental and economic. The technical indicators are determined based on a common framework established using the Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) protocol. Environmental and economic indicators results are given using a process Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database. Information stored in the database using both variable and invariable unit process. The calculation is respectively done with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) methodologies. During the design phases, specific information is provided to establish the unit process performance of each recycling scenario. In this article, we present how the performance indicators were selected and calculated in regard with the decision support methodology build up.",['sde']

Flood regimes - recent development and future under climate change,"In the past thirty years, knowledge on flooding has greatly increased by moving away from purely hydrological and hydraulic science and opening up to other disciplines such as economics or human and geographical sciences. It is as part of this multidisciplinary approach that this book proposes a review of current knowledge on flood risk. It starts with the ever-increasing impact of flooding in order to conceptualize and understand the constituents of risk. Although risk knowledge in modeling methods or naturalist approaches remains essential, it is further developed by the fields of economics, human sciences, geography, environmental psychology and history. This integrated approach to flood risk contextualizes current conclusions on the eventual effects of climate change by showing that human factors are of paramount importance in understanding the process of “risk production . The book sets a state of art around the ""flood issue"" from the description of the phenomena to the management of risk (dikes, dams, reducing vulnerability, management of crisis...). The chapters are written by specialists but are accessible to the ""mainstream scientist"". Each chapter exposes knowledge, methodologies, scientific locks and the prospects of each discipline on the theme of floods.",['sde']

A Large Input Voltage Range 1 MHz Full Converter with 95% Peak Effic iency for Aircraft Applications,"This paper presents a design methodology of a 50 lV isolated DC/DC converter serving as a power supply for aircraft equipment like a FADEC (Full Authority Digital Electronics Control). The particularity of this work is the design of a full converter regarding two antagonistic requirements which are a wide input voltage with an high efficiency. To fulfill those requirements an optimization regarding three different levels is done: 1- A suitable topology for wide input voltage range, 2- Proper technologies for high frequency operation and 3- A converter architecture to minimize the surface. A 50W, 18 - 80 V input voltage, 1MHz switching frequency converter is built using GaN transistors and a planar transformer. The proposed converter operates under optimized soft-switching conditions in order to minimize Switching losses and reached a peak efficiency of 95 %. This converter is compared with 2 other converters: an hard-switching 400 kHz Flyback topology which is the industrial standard equipment and an 1MHz soft-switching topology without the architecture optimization.",['spi']

In this switching frequency range, GaN transistors and planar transformer are used in order to improve the efficiency.",['spi']
Inégalité de genre dans les études éthiopiennesGender inequality in Ethiopian Studies,"I’d like to draw the attention of the scholar community on the gender inequality at the recent ICES20 in Mekelle. Very broadly, the figures are the following (using the book of abstract as main source). For panel presenters, 74% of men and 26% of women. Among whom, 50% of Ethiopian men for 7,5% of Ethiopian women, and 23,5% of foreign men for 18,5% of foreign women. Then, for panel organisers: 70% of men and 30% of women. Among whom, 39% of Ethiopian men for 3% of Ethiopian women, and 39% of foreign men for 27% of foreign women. This is not so surprising to see the involvement of women in organising the panels (in comparison with the figures of women in presenters), but Ethiopian women remain dramatically under-represented in this role. The 3 keynotes speech were delivered by men exclusively (one Ethiopian and two foreigners), despite the tentative done by some members of the scientific board to promote women researchers at this role. The main organising committee was almost exclusively masculine, when the scientific international committee was composed of 2/3 of men and 1/3 of women, with no Ethiopian among the later.

The Holographic Universe,"I give a critical review of the holographic hypothesis, which posits that a universe with gravity can be described by a quantum field theory in fewer dimensions. I first recall how the idea originated from considerations on black hole thermodynamics and the so-called information paradox that arises when Hawking radiation is taken into account. String Quantum Gravity tried to solve the puzzle using the AdS/CFT correspondence, according to which a black hole in a 5-D anti-de Sitter space is like a flat 4-D field of particles and radiation. Although such an interesting holographic property, also called gauge/gravity duality, has never been proved rigorously, it has impulsed a number of research programs in fields as diverse as nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, general relativity and cosmology. I finally discuss the pros and cons of the holographic conjecture, and emphasizes the key role played by black holes for understanding quantum gravity and possible dualities between distant fields of theoretical physics.",['phys']
Existence of a Critical Layer Thickness in PS/PMMA Nanolayered Films,"An experimental study was carried out to investigate the existence of a critical layer thickness in nanolayer coextrusion, under which no continuous layer is observed. Polymer films containing thousands of layers of alternating polymers with individual layer thicknesses below 100 nm have been prepared by coextrusion through a series of layer multiplying elements. Different films composed of alternating layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) were fabricated with the aim to reach individual layer thicknesses as small as possible, varying the number of layers, the mass composition of both components, and the final total thickness of the film. Films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and a statistical analysis was used to determine the distribution in layer thicknesses and the continuity of layers. For the PS/PMMA nanolayered systems, results point out the existence of a critical layer thickness around 10 nm, below which the layers break up. This critical layer thickness is reached regardless of the processing route, suggesting it might be dependent only on material characteristics but not on process parameters. We propose this breakup phenomenon is due to small interfacial perturbations that are amplified by (van der Waals) disjoining forces",['spi']
Role of Charge of Micellar Worms in Modulating Structure and Rheological Properties of Their Mixtures with Nonionic Polymer,"The paper describes phase behavior, microstructure, and rheological properties of the mixtures of surfactant micelles of varying negative charge with nonionic hydrophilic polymer poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) weakly interacting with the micelles. To reduce the charge of micelles, a cationic surfactant n-octyltrimethylammonium bromide was gradually added to the anionic surfactant potassium oleate. No appreciable interactions between the micelles and polymer were revealed by NMR spectroscopy. At the same time, the system shows a broad range of compatibility, which may be due to surfactant counterions preventing the demixing. The higher the concentration of added polymer, the higher the charge density of micelles necessary to prevent macrophase separation. However, SANS data demonstrate that upon the addition of polymer the intermicellar distances decrease, which suggests that the micelles are expelled from some area filled by PVA macromolecules, indicating a local demixing. A decrease of micellar charge density induces the growth of micelles from short nonoverlapping cylinders to long entangled wormlike chains both in the presence and in the absence of polymer, which is accompanied by an increase of viscosity by up to 5 orders of magnitude. Despite very weak interactions with the micelles, PVA makes their growth in length much more pronounced and forms the entanglements with micellar chains, thereby enhancing significantly the viscoelastic properties. The effect of polymer on micellar length was attributed to polymer-surfactant microsegregation increasing the local surfactant concentration and consequently the length of micelles. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the addition of weakly interacting polymer for the modulation of rheology of wormlike surfactant micelles, thus opening a new way for manipulating the rheological properties of viscoelastic surfactants.",['chim']
On the role of hydrogen bonding on water absorption in polymers,"A kinetic model is proposed for the absorption of water in polymers. The process of bonding-debonding water molecules is described by two opposite reactions with different rate constants, and the key role of the concentration of traps by hydrogen bonding in the polymer matrix is highlighted. These three parameters are combined such that an equation is obtained that generalizes the model proposed by Carter and Kibler, with an additional, crossed, term. Numerical application is performed for the diffusion-absorption of water in a plane polymer sheet, and the parameter ranges where a quasi-Fickian water uptake curve is obtained are defined. The associated apparent diffusivity is shown to obey a hyperbolic variation with equilibrium water uptake for homologous series of polymers, which is in agreement with previous experimental observations.","['chim', 'spi']"
Uncertainty quantification applied to the radiological characterization of radioactive waste,"This paper describes the process adopted at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) to quantify uncertainties affecting the characterization of very-low-level radioactive waste. Radioactive waste is a by-product of the operation of high-energy particle accelerators. Radioactive waste must be characterized to ensure its safe disposal in final repositories. Characterizing radioactive waste means establishing the list of radionuclides together with their activities. The estimated activity levels are compared to the limits given by the national authority of the waste disposal. The quantification of the uncertainty affecting the concentration of the radionuclides is therefore essential to estimate the acceptability of the waste in the final repository but also to control the sorting, volume reduction and packaging phases of the characterization process. The characterization method consists of estimating the activity of produced radionuclides either by experimental methods or statistical approaches. The uncertainties are estimated using classical statistical methods and uncertainty propagation. A mixed multivariate random vector is built to generate random input parameters for the activity calculations. The random vector is a robust tool to account for the unknown radiological history of legacy waste. This analytical technique is also particularly useful to generate random chemical compositions of materials when the trace element concentrations are not available or cannot be measured. The methodology was validated using a waste population of legacy copper activated at CERN. The methodology introduced here represents a first approach for the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the characterization process of waste produced at particle accelerators.",['phys']

"Quelles relations entre la mer, les nappes souterraines et les eaux de surface dans le delta du Rhône ?","Les échanges d'eau sont contrôlés par un système de vannes et pertuis qui relient les étangs à la mer à travers la « Digue à la mer ». Sur la période 1994-2010, les volumes d'eau moyens échangés au niveau du pertuis de la Fourcade sont d'environ 11 millions de m 3 / an d'entrée marine et 20 millions de m 3 /an de sortie vers la mer. Malgré ce système, de grandes variations interannuelles se produisent. En effet, les flux restent dépendants des différences de niveau d'eau de part et d'autre, qui eux dépendent des facteurs environnementaux « internes » (apports d'eau par l'irrigation des rizières) et « externes » : les précipitations et le vent qui influencent le niveau d'eau des étangs, ainsi que les variations du niveau de la mer. Ces variations se produisent à court terme en fonction de la marée et des conditions météorologiques, avec notamment les phénomènes de surcotes marines, et à long terme en relation avec la remontée du niveau de la mer (1 à 7,5 mm/an-voir question 17 : « Changement climatique et surcotes marines, quel avenir pour les plages camarguaises ? »). Les relations entre les eaux souterraines et la mer Il existe une continuité des formations géologiques de part et d'autre du trait de côte permettant des échanges d'eau entre les eaux souterraines et la mer (fig. 1). Les différences de niveau entre la mer et les nappes régissent la direction et l'intensité des flux d'eau. Le bilan de ces flux se produit majoritairement en direction de la mer. Mais il existe néanmoins une intrusion saline, qui explique la salinité plus élevée des eaux de la nappe captive le long de la côte. L'augmentation progressive du niveau de la mer favorise l'intrusion de l'eau de mer dans les terres, ce qui entraînera à plus ou moins long terme une accentuation de la salinisation des eaux. L'eau partout présente en Camargue provient soit de la mer, soit des précipitations, soit de son fleuve. Depuis l'endiguement du Rhône, ce sont essentiellement les canaux d'irrigation et de drainage qui déterminent la distribution de l'eau du fleuve à travers son delta (photo 1). Les eaux continentales souterraines et en surface L'île de Camargue reçoit à la fois des eaux de pluie (470 millions de m 3 /an en moyenne) et des eaux d'irrigation issues du Rhône (296 et 362 millions de m 3 /an pour 1996 et 1993, Fondation Sansouire). En surface, le système lagunaire du Vaccarès est le réceptacle principal des flux hydriques de la zone (photo 2). Dans le sous-sol, on distingue deux types de nappes (fig. 1). Les sédiments récents du Rhône se trouvent sur une épaisseur variant de quelques mètres vers Arles jusqu'à environ 50 m vers le littoral et abritent des nappes plus ou moins connectées et de salinité très variable : douce, salée et même sursalée (jusqu'à 110 g/l, la mer étant à 38 g/l). Au-dessous, une formation de cailloutis grossiers abrite une nappe captive (séparée de la surface par une couche imperméable), dont la salinité augmente progressivement en direction de la mer depuis des eaux presque douces (≈2 g/l au nord) à des eaux de composition marine au sud. Les relations entre les eaux de surface et les eaux souterraines Les échanges d'eau entre la surface et le sous-sol sont complexes et se produisent soit par infiltration d'eau, soit par remontées artésiennes (sous pression). En fonction de l'occupation du sol, les eaux qui s'infiltrent proviennent de l'irrigation des rizières ou de la pluie dans les zones naturelles. Les remontées d'eau vers la surface se produisent quand la pression de l'eau souterraine le permet. On observe ce phénomène là où la topographie est légèrement plus basse, par exemple en bordure nord du Vaccarès où se trouve un forage artésien, mais il est le plus souvent invisible et difficile à quantifier. Ainsi, les étangs de Camargue, et de Vaccarès en particulier, reçoivent une quantité importante d'eau souterraine, estimée à environ un quart des apports de surface. Quelles relations entre la mer, les nappes souterraines et les eaux de surface dans le delta du Rhône ?",['phys']
Money and monetary policy in the Eurozone: an empirical analysis during crises,"This paper analyzes the role of money and monetary policy as well as the forecasting performance of New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with and without separability between consumption and money. The study is conducted over three crisis periods in the Eurozone, namely, the ERM crisis, the dot-com crisis, and the global financial crisis (GFC). The results of successive Bayesian estimations demonstrate that during these crises, the non-separable model generally provides better out-of-sample output forecasts than the baseline model. We also demonstrate that money shocks have some impact on output variations during crises, especially in the case of the GFC. Furthermore, the response of output to a money shock is more persistent during the GFC than during the other crises. The impact of monetary policy also changes during crises. Insofar as the GFC is concerned, this impact increases at the beginning of the crisis, but decreases sharply thereafter.",['shs']
Mathematical and numerical analysis in thermo-gradient-dependent theory of plasticity,"In this paper, we develop new governing equations for thermo-gradient-dependent theory of plasticity. They include the coupled effects of thermal elastic-plastic theory, including balance and constitutive equations. To demonstrate the salient feature of the gradient-dependent model of plasticity, particular attention is addressed to isotropic hardening with second sound effects to eliminate the paradox of infinite speed of thermal signals. The resulting system of partial differential equations formally describes the coupled thermomechanical behavior of the gradient-dependent elasto-plastic system. Then, we develop an appropriate state-space form and, by using the semigroup theory, we prove the well-posedness and the exponential stability of the thermo-gradient-dependent elasto-plastic one-dimensional problem. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to validate the proposed model and to show its capability.",['spi']
"Naphthalimide derivatives: substituent effects on the photoinitiating ability in polymerizations under near UV, purple, white and blue LEDs (385 nm, 395 nm, 405 nm, 455 nm or 470 nm)","Naphthalimide derivatives (NDAs) with amino- or alkylthio-substituents have been synthesized and combined in photoinitiating systems (PIS) with an iodonium salt, N-vinylcarbazole, an amine, or 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine to produce radicals, cation radicals, or cations. The photochemical mechanisms are investigated by fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, and steady state photolysis techniques. The generated reactive species are capable of initiating the cationic polymerization (CP) of epoxides under air or the free radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylates in laminate upon exposure to visible lights delivered by a halogen lamp, a cold white light-emitting diode (LED), or LEDs at 385, 395, 405, 455, or 470 nm. Compared to the well-known camphorquinone based systems, the novel NDA containing PISs exhibit higher efficiencies both for CP and FRP. Remarkably, the photo­bleaching of some NDAs is significant, and colorless final polymer coatings are obtained. The structure/photochemical property relationships of NDAs are discussed in detail (redox potentials, fluorescence, rate constants of reactions, etc.) to shed some light on their respective photoinitiating ability.",['chim']
Cationic photoinitiators for Near UV and visible LEDs: A particular insight into one-component systems,"The observed development of one-component photoinitiators of cationic polymerization reactions in the last forty years is briefly described. Cationic photoinitiators can usually be activated by short wavelengths (<300 nm) and relatively hard conditions (high intensity). The search for cheaper and safer light sources has led to the use of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). In this review, a special emphasis is provided on the most recent and promising cationic initiators operating under near UV and visible LEDs. Ferrocenium salts exhibit the broadest visible light absorption and are probably, from this point of view, the most versatile near UV and visible light cationic initiators. Excellent photoinitiation performance has been found with the ferrocenium salts as one-component initiators, and the effect of ferrocenium salts based multi-component photoinitiating systems on the relevant photoinitiation performance has also been investigated.",['chim']

They address the present and future challenges facing photopolymerization: requirement of high extinction molar coefficients, absorption over the whole visible spectrum, ability to easily withdraw or release electrons. Interestingly, these compounds initiate the cationic polymerization of epoxides or the free radical polymerization of acrylates upon exposure of the photocurable formulations to a LED emitting at 405 nm. Some of them can potentially operate under blue, green, or red laser diodes.",['chim']
"A high quality reprocessed ground-based GPS dataset for atmospheric process studies, radiosonde and model evaluation, and reanalysis of HyMeX Special Observing Period","In the framework of the HyMeX project, measurements from more than one thousand ground-based GPS receivers located in the north-western Mediterranean area are reprocessed using a single GPS software for the period from 1st September 2012 to 31 March 2013. A special screening procedure is developed for the removal of outliers in the GPS ZTD data. ZTD data are converted to IWV using surface pressure information from AROME-WMED operational analysis. The reprocessed ZTD and IWV data are used to assess the accuracy of the near real time E-GVAP ZTD data assimilated in operational NWP systems and to validate the IWV data from AROME-WMED operational analysis and AROME-WMED reanalysis 1, and from radiosonde observations. The mean differences between E-GVAP and reprocessed ZTD data are not negligible and lie in the range from −3 to +3 mm. The standard deviations of differences are between 4 and 8 mm. The comparisons of IWV from AROME-WMED analyses and the reprocessed GPS data show high quality of the analyses where operational GPS data are assimilated and lower quality where no GPS data are assimilated. Small but significant biases are found in the radiosonde data at daytime (−0.5 to +1.4 kg m−2), but their origin is not determined so far. Thanks to the high spatial density of the reprocessed GPS stations, both the large scale and small scale variations in IWV can be documented. The case of HyMeX Intensive Observing Period 8 is presented as an example of heavy precipitation event. This work suggests that improved quality of the humidity fields can be expected of the future AROME-WMED reanalysis 2 as a result of the assimilation of the reprocessed GPS data.",['phys']

"A Language and Methodology based on Scenarios, Grammars and Views, for Administrative Business Processes Modelling","In Business Process Management (BPM), process modelling has been solved in various ways. However, there are no commonly accepted modelling tools (languages). Some of them are criticized for their inability to capture both the lifecycle, informational and organizational models of processes. For some others, process modelling is generally done using a single graph; this does not facilitate modularity, maintenance and scalability. In addition, some of these languages are very general; hence, their application to specific domain processes (such as administrative processes) is very complex. In this paper, we present a new language and a new methodology, dedicated to administrative process modelling. This language is based on a variant of attributed grammars and is able to capture the lifecycle, informational and organizational models of such processes. Also, it proposes a simple graphical formalism allowing to model each process's execution scenario as an annotated tree (modularity).

For tracking, we employ a Monte Carlo implementation of a Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD)-filter, whereas scene context (road and lane information) is taken from annotated street maps. The novel aspect of the presented work is the tightly coupling of context information and the particle filtering process. This is achieved by injecting a priori particles representing locally expected motions, which are in turn determined by the local road and the lane configuration. This approach is evaluated on objects (tracklets) from the public KITTI benchmark database. Our experimental findings demonstrate a considerable tracking precision increasing when including this kind of a priori knowledge. At the same time, the approach is able to determine objects whose movements differ from the locally expected motion, which is an important feature for safety applications.",['info']
Are Wolves Becoming Bolder? Wolves hurt livestock and local communities in the United States and France.,"Grey wolves were reintroduced in the northern Rocky Mountains (NRM) in the mid-1990s, at about the same time wolves discretely came on their own to France, crossing the Alps from Italy. Twentyfive years later, about 1,800 wolves inhabit the NRM while over 500 wolves live in France. The number of wolf packs (72) in the French Alps is similar to that in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The main difference, apart from the different landscapes, land tenures, and uses by humans, lies in the number of animals depredated in the two countries: a few hundred per year in the NRM; and more than 10,000 per year, mostly sheep, in France. Since 2008, yearly livestock killings due to wolves in France have grown linearly, reaching 12,515 in 2018. Why the differences between NRM and France? What went wrong in France? Don’t French wolves have access to wild ungulates as prey in the Alps? Aren’t livestock protected in France?",['sde']
Aluminium cables recycling process: Environmental impacts identification and reduction,"Life cycle impact of European generic primary and secondary aluminium are well defined. However specific end-of-Life scenario for aluminium products are not available in the literature. In this study, the environmental assessment of cable recycling pathway is examined using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The data comes from a recycling plant (MTB Recycling) in France. MTB Recycling process relies only on mechanical separation and optical sorting steps on shredder cables to obtain a high purity aluminium (above 99.6%). The life cycle assessment results confirm the huge environmental benefits for aluminium recycled in comparison with primary aluminium. In addition, our study demonstrates the gains of product centric recycling pathways for cables. The mechanical separation is a relevant alternative to metal smelting recycling. This work was done firstly to document specific environmental impact of the MTB Recycling processes in comparison with traditional aluminium recycling smelting. Secondly, to provide an environmental overview of the process steps in order to reduce the environmental impact of this recycling pathway. The identified environmental hotspots from the LCA for the MTB recycling pathway provide help for designers to carry on reducing the environmental impact.","['sde', 'spi']"
"An empirical classification-based framework for the safety criticality assessment of energy production systems, in presence of inconsistent data","The technical problem addressed in the present paper is the assessment of the safety criticality of energy production systems. An empirical classification model is developed, based on the Majority Rule Sorting method, to evaluate the class of criticality of the plant/system of interest, with respect to safety. The model is built on the basis of a (limited-size) set of data representing the characteristics of a number of plants and their corresponding criticality classes, as assigned by experts. The construction of the classification model may raise two issues. First, the classification examples provided by the experts may contain contradictions: a validation of the consistency of the considered dataset is, thus, required. Second, uncertainty affects the process: a quantitative assessment of the performance of the classification model is, thus, in order, in terms of accuracy and confidence in the class assignments. In this paper, two approaches are proposed to tackle the first issue: the inconsistencies in the data examples are “resolved” by deleting or relaxing, respectively, some constraints in the model construction process. Three methods are proposed to address the second issue: (i) a model retrieval-based approach, (ii) the Bootstrap method and (iii) the cross-validation technique. Numerical analyses are presented with reference to an artificial case study regarding the classification of Nuclear Power Plants.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
French teacher perceptions of student learning about force: a preliminary study,"Background Many researchers have investigated student reasoning in Newtonian mechanics. In 1979 Viennot revealed that most students associate the concept of force with the velocity or acceleration of a motion. Forty years later, student understandings remain a major challenge for teachers. The implications of this challenge are still unclear, however, including the effect on the instructions given by teachers. Purpose This paper investigated the perceptions that French teachers of science, technology and engineering have of core student misconceptions about, and learning difficulties with, the subject of force, and the extent to which these are dependent on a teacher’s subject knowledge, and how they affect grade levels. Sample One hundred teachers in the Académie d'Aix-Marseille, an educational organisation in the southeast France, were questioned randomly about their views on student learning issues of force. Design and method Teacher views were collected using an exploratory study based on an online questionnaire which included Likert-based and closed questions. The data was analysed using nonparametric tests. Results The analysis revealed four major outcomes: (1) main perceptions of misconceptions related to student ‘impetus force’ and ‘force linked to an object weight’, (2) key learning difficulties included ‘knowledge transfer’ and ‘knowledge construction’, (3) teachers believed that the Aristotelian view was still a common barrier to learning Newtonian mechanics, and (4) differences in perceptions were due, essentially, to the teachers’ subject domain and not to the grades they taught. The only statistically significant difference in perceptions between teachers was linked to the idea of impetus force, with this corresponding to discipline philosophy. Conclusion This paper provides baseline evidence about teacher perceptions of student learning about force, which suggests that more systemic teaching approaches are crucial to foster student conceptual understanding, transfer and knowledge construction. Some implications for teachers and curriculum developers are discussed.","['scco', 'phys', 'shs']"
Thermal response of DP600 dual-phase steel under ultrasonic fatigue loading,"The present work employed in situ infrared thermography to investigate the thermal response and dissipative mechanisms of a dual-phase steel under ultrasonic tension-compression fatigue testing. A classical thermal response occurred for stress amplitudes below 247 MPa but an abnormal thermal response was observed for stress amplitudes above 247 MPa, in that the temperature stabilized after a steep increase of up to 350 °C. The mean dissipated energy per cycle was estimated based on temperature measurements using the heat diffusion equation. The relationship between the mean dissipated energy per cycle and the stress amplitude was studied, and mechanisms related to the observed thermal response were discussed.","['phys', 'spi', 'chim']"
The effects of the Fenton reaction are limited by zeolites in vitro,"We report the effects of zeolite pore systems in limiting the oxidation of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in plasma using the mixing of FeCl2 and H2O2 (“Fenton solution”) as an oxidant. We tested three homemade zeolites and nineteen natural zeolites. Six polar zeolites were effective in restricting the oxidation of vitamin C and the majority of them acted by chelation of ferrous/ferric chloride. Faujasite (FAU13x) was the most active ROS scavenger. On the other hand, two natural zeolites, Goosecreekite and Stilbite (GOOnat and STInat), inhibited the oxidation of vitamin C by action on the reduction of hydrogen peroxide concentration to form H2O. Our hypothesis suggests that effective zeolites have the advantage of never being saturated in the time. Here, for the first time, we identified a substrate (zeolite) which acts directly on the two substrates (Fe2+/H2O2) to limit ROS formation.",['chim']

Tiananmen: Lives of the PoetsAn illustrated history of Chinese poets in 1980s Peking and their first years of exile after the Tiananmen Massacre,"An illustrated history of Chinese poets in 1980s Peking and their first years of exile after the Tiananmen Massacre The year 1989 was meant to be a year of taking stock: 40 years since the founding of the People’s Republic, 70 since the May 4th protests against the ignominious Versailles Peace Treaty—protests which also ended with brutal suppression on Tiananmen Square—and 10 years since the “demolition” of Democracy Wall and the arrest of pro-democracy activist Wei Jingsheng. At the beginning of 1989 the astrophysicist Fang Lizhi in his open letter to Deng Xiaoping had highlighted the significance of these anniversaries and called for clemency and the early release of Wei. In 1989, expectation was in the air. But no-one expected the sudden death of disgraced, liberal-minded former Premier Hu Yaobang. It was represented by reformers as a re-run of 1976 when Zhou Enlai’s death prompted protestors onto the streets. It would prove to be a spark igniting the 1989 protests. There were two further anniversaries in 1989. One that would be ignored was the 10th March 1959, the Tibetan Uprising and the invasion of Tibet by the PLA. Protests had been ongoing since September 1987, but were brutally put down within days of the anniversary in March 1989. The New China News Agency reports that I analysed at the BBC said the situation was fine, which meant it wasn’t. And yet this clue to the government’s ability to resort to lethal suppression of protest was ignored by pundits and ordinary citizens alike. In Xinjiang, too, taking advantage of the province’s isolation, Uighur protests were bloodily put down in the month of May. Another warning sign that went unheeded. Perhaps, after all, these were mere troublesome fringe elements? And the Communist Party would never treat its own in such a fashion, would it? All of which is reminiscent of the admonition in Pastor Martin Niemöller’s post World War II “Confession”:”First they came for the Jews…” The other major 1989 event due to be celebrated, especially in China, was the bicentenary of the French Revolution. Two hundred years since the outbreak of the mother of all revolutions. China was to have been officially represented on the Champs Elysées in the Bastille Day parade. Instead, on 14th July 1989, black-clad Chinese students, now officially refugees, observed by a crowd of 800,000, pushed bicycles down the avenue in silent homage to their compatriots who had perished together with their ideals, a month before on the Square.",['shs']
The Commonplace of “Work as Freedom” and why the Left is so attached to its virtues,"In recent years, there has been a growing political interest in the idea of a basic guaranteed revenue for all. In the current French presidential election campaign, the Socialist Party candidate Benoît Hamon in his political programme initially proposed a “universal revenue”, or basic income for all. However, in the face of widespread dismay at the very idea of paying people not to work, even from within his own party, he has gradually whittled down his proposition to a means-tested allowance for those in or out of work for 18 to 25 year-olds with a revenue of less than 1.9 times the minimum wage. In attempting to understand this politically global (left-wing and right-wing) attachment to the “virtue” of work, we may turn to Jacques Ellul’s work. “Work as freedom” is one of the “commonplaces” that the late political theorist, ecological activist, protestant and anarchist, Jacques Ellul analysed in his 1966 book Exégèse des nouveaux lieux communs [Exegesis of new commonplaces];new or nouveaux since the title alludes to the turn-of-the-century work Exégèses des lieux communs by the essayist and polemicist Léon Bloy (1846-1917).",['shs']

Integration of Passive and Active Microwave Remote Sensing to Estimate Water Quality Parameters,"In this paper, a new method has been presented to estimate of the Water Quality Parameters (WQPs) such as Electrical Conductivity (EC), salinity and Total Dissolved Salt (TDS). This method is mainly depended on the thermal and SAR images as an active and passive input satellite data. A Small Perturbation Method (SPM) using the Elfouhaily spectrum has been used as a physical model to calculate the electromagnetic scattering by the river surface. This method is basically used in the inversion process to find the physical parameters of water. The inversion process is fallen into three steps: first step includes, the estimation of the reflectivity coefficients via SAR image; then, the second step, the polarization coefficient (in VV or HH polarizations) is used to find the water dielectric constant; finally, the Debye formulation is used to find the salinity value. In this study, the thermal band is used to obtain the temperature of the water surface which we used in our proposed method. Total Dissolved Salts (TDS) is estimated by calculation of the electrical conductivity (EC) which is directly derived from the salinity value. To validate our methodology, a dataset of in situ data is used and the comparison between the WQP estimated using the proposed method and those obtained from in situ data is achieved. The obtained results shows, that the using of thermal image is helped to estimate salinity ranges close to in situ, consequently, enhance the produced TDS. The results also show that the thermal-TSX is helpful to improve the estimation and mapping of WQP for the practical use in the study area with high accuracy.",['spi']
"Clustering Algorithm in ILWIS GIS for Classification of Landsat TM Scenes (Mecsek Hills Region, Hungary)","Current research has been performed at Eötvös Loránd University, Institute of Cartography. - RESEARCH EMPHASIS: application of clustering spatial analysis of the open source ILWIS GIS. - RESEARCH AIM: agricultural mapping of land cover types: south-west Hungary, Mecsek Hills. - RESEARCH PROCESS: Landsat TM scenes were classified into different land use types: natural veg- etation coverage, anthropogenic areas and agricul- tural fields, sub-divided to various crop types. - RESEARCH OUTPUT: three independent agricultural thematic maps of land cover types for years 1992, 1999 and 2006, created in ILWIS GIS. - RESEARCH DATA: Landsat TM on 14.09.1992, a) 09.08.1999 b) 19.07.2006 - METHODS: The research methodology is based on cluster classification algorithm available in ILWIS GIS. The work is organized in several research steps summarized in the research workflow: The research area was classified into a set of land cover categories, labelled to following land units: 1) winter wheat 2) spring barley, 3) maize 4) sugar beet 5) maize for ensilage 6) oak and beech forests 7) potato 8) other crops 9) shrubland 10) water 11) not agricult. areas 12) grassland 13) other land cover types Field crops (e.g. maize, winter wheat) were detected on the images. The species with unclear nature of crop or not easily recognized were defined as ’other crops’. A Google Earth aerial imagery was used for visual control inspection. Once all clusters are grouped, the layout was created using representation palette defined in the domain ’Land Cover Types. The research results in 3 maps of land cover types for 1992, 1999 and 2006. Clustering method can be applied for other agricultural areas, since it enables objective classification in regions with high land heterogeneity and complex landscape structure. PRINCIPLE Clustering is based on principle of spectral distinguishability of digital cells. The Digital Numbers (DNs) of pixels create unique spectral signatures for various objects. Clustering extracts info on pixels and analyses similarity of their DNs. Pixels with similar value of DNs are assigned to thematic categories (clusters). The grouping is done according to pixels’ similarity, which is larger within a group than among other groups. ADVANTAGES Clustering is objective technique, useful in situations when fieldwork is not available. It enables to avoid misclassified pixels and ignore external factors (e.g. atmospheric conditions), which significantly facilitates spatial analysis of the images.",['info']

Optic-Flow Based Car-Like Robot Operating in a 5-Decade Light Level Range,"In this paper, we present (i) a novel bio-inspired 1-D OF sensor which is robust to high-dynamic-range lighting conditions and independent of the visual patterns encountered, and (ii) a low-cost car-like robot called BioCarBot, which estimates its velocity and steering angle by means of an Extended Kalman Filer (EKF) using only the OF measurements delivered by two downward-facing sensors of this kind. Indoor experiments were carried out, in which the robot was driven in the closed-loop mode, using a proportional integral (PI) controller based on the velocity and steering angle estimates. The results presented here show that our novel OF sensor can deliver a wide range of high-frequency (333 Hz) OF measurements (from 1 to 10 rad s) with a relatively high resolution (up to 0.05 rad s) in a 5-decade high-dynamic range of light levels. Neither the refresh rate nor the resolution of the OF sensors presented here depended on either the visual patterns or the lighting conditions, and could be theoretically set at whatever value required.",['spi']
Validation formelle d’implantation de patrons de sécurité : Application aux SCADA,"Les systèmes de contrôle et d’acquisition de données (SCADA) sont des systèmes spécifiques, avec leurs propres exigences fonctionnelles et contraintes, dont la sécurité est quasi absente.

Cascade of Nonlinear Entropy and Statistics to Discriminate Fetal Heart Rates,"—Fetal heart rate discrimination is an evolving field in biomedical engineering with many efforts dedicated to avoid preterm deliveries by way of improving fetus monitoring methods and devices. Entropy analysis is a nonlinear signal analysis technique that has been progressively developed to improve the discriminability of a several physiological signals, with Kernel based entropy parameters (KBEPs) found advantageous over standard techniques. This study is the first to apply KBEPs to analyze fetal heart rates. Specifically, it explores the usability of the cutting-edge nonlinear KBEPs in discriminating between healthy fetuses and fetuses under distress. The database used in this study comprises 50 healthy and 50 distressed fetal heart rate signals with severe intrauterine growth restriction. The Cascade analysis investigates six kernel based entropy measures on fetal heart rates discrimination, and compares them to four standard entropies. The study presents a statistical evaluation of the discrimination power of each parameter (paired t-test statistics and distribution spread). Simulation results showed that the distribution ranges in 80% of the entropy parameters in the distressed heart group are higher than those in the healthy control group. Moreover, the results show that it is advantageous to choose Circular entropy then Cauchy entropy (p < 0.001) over the standard techniques, in order to discriminate fetal heart rates.",['sdv']

Hans Jonas theory and its applicability for teaching computer ethics in the information age,"In the information era, the power of the so-called ICT (Information & Communication Technologies) has greatly increased the responsibility of each citizen within the global society. Information professionals are not unaware of this fact. We have always defended the need to include humanistic courses, and, specifically, professional ethics and deontology, in the curricular content of future information specialists. In today's world, with the challenge of globalization, in order for us to respond as individuals and as a society, that need has grown. The work of information professionals has an impact on all systems, whether social, economic or political. Thus, they must be conscious at all times of the implications of every type derived from their activities. The aim of this paper is, first, to stress the fact that universities continue to be the setting for the preparation of the human resources that our society needs, and that this, and this alone, remains their basic task, despite their often having opted for a criteria of technical training with a very scarce humanistic component and lacking in social consciousness. Looking toward the future, it is difficult to imagine that the ethical problems derived from the use of the ICT are going to disappear or even diminish over the coming years. Thus, the new information professionals of the 21st century will have to continue to address all these questions, making the presence of professional ethics and deontology in their curriculum nearly indispensable. Moreover, we consider the teaching method known as ""saturate the curriculum"" to be positive but insufficient. It may prove highly beneficial that students of the information sciences reflect on ethical dilemmas or situations that arise in the course of their more technical subjects. They would thus begin to familiarize themselves with these questions. However, if this is not backed up later on by the inclusion of a more specific course, their ethical training at the time of graduation will clearly be deficient. There are several reasons for this. To begin with, the instructor of this more technical course probably lacks the necessary philosophical background to be able to properly explain to his or her students how to make an ethical decision, on what criteria to base it or which theories are more suitable in each case. In fact, an inadequate explanation of all these questions could even be counterproductive. On the other hand, the explanation of isolated cases without including them in a more solid theory and, ideally, a complete course, with sufficient time to develop a subject matter that provides a minimum knowledge of the most important ethical issues, might create a greater confusion among the students with regard to these matters. This brings us to another important question, whether or not it is appropriate to include a section dedicated to ethical theory in the course subject matter. Opinions concerning this point range from proposals to reduce the course to lessons on applied ethics, completely ignoring philosophical theory, to others supporting a program based on the ideas of the major philosophers, keeping the elements of informatics deontology to a minimum. We consider an intermediate pathway to be the best, dividing the program into two part to include both aspects, necessary, in our opinion, for the student of information engineering to achieve the proper ethical training. As would appear to be obvious, the only way to accomplish this goal is to offer a course devoted to this topic. We analyze here the theory of one of the authors whose inclusion in our pedagogical proposal we consider most suitable because of the emphasis he has placed on the power of the ICT and on the responsibility derived from this circumstance for mankind. We refer to Hans Jonas who, in his work The principle of responsibility states, among other things, that wherever there is power, there is also responsibility. His affirmation is based on a reflection on the relationship between man and nature, a relationship that had not previously been considered in an ethical context. However, with the arrival on the scene of the ICT, nature, which we had exploited uncaringly until now, has been rendered fragile, vulnerable. This signifies that man himself is vulnerable. Therefore, our obligation is to conserve it; that is our responsibility, a responsibility that is indefinite. Given the material power conferred by the ICT on the individual even to destroy humanity, he must feel responsible not only for his own behavior and its most direct consequence, but for possible indirect and much more distant effects and consequences as well. Thus, we consider Jonas' work to be especially applicable for teaching a course on professional ethics and deontology within the framework of the present information era. After analyzing his theory, in the final section of our paper, we propose several ways of applying it to the course, especially with regard to case studies and the explanation of some of the topics that are most frequently included in the study program and in informatics deontological codes. The ultimate objective is to establish a new approach, a new teaching model adapted to the present circumstances, and we think that Jonas offers an ideal one.",['shs']
On Urban Planning -B. Marchand Planning : Some Lessons for Eastern Europe from France and Western Europe,"Planning developped at the beginning of the XX th Century, particularly in Fascist dictatorships (Germany and Italy) and in Communist Countries. It was particularly popular after the Great Depression (1929-1931), which seemed to announce the end of the capitalist model. In France, it appeared under the Pétain Régime (1940-1945). Its main task was to organize the production of goods and services on a national basis. It was reinforced after WW II, when most European economies were largely destroyed. During the 1970's, for different reasons, the goal of planning changed radically : it was not to foster production any longer but to fight regional inequality, unemployment and to advance urban development and ecological goals. In this endeavor, European Western nations have imagined new tools, met difficult challenges and made many errors. Eastern nations, opening to the West, may hopefully learn from them and find better ways.",['shs']
Treasures of Chinese Culture: Painting and Opera,"Current presentation discusses question of the Chinese culture and among others, painting, calligraphy and opera. Painting and calligraphy are of the same origin and are regarded as two treasured arts in China. They are both liked with free movement and distribution of lines in expression. Together with music and chess, they formed the four skills for a learned scholar to pursue in ancient China. They have also been held as a good exercise to temper one’s character and cultivate one’s personality. Chinese painting has a long history and excellent tradition. Through thousands of years, it has developed its own style, its own techniques, and a complete system of art which expresses the aesthetics of the nation. Through its unique style and features, it has established supremacy in the world of art, Chinese painting emphasizes the point that “Inspiration comes from close observation and understanding of Nature.” Traditional Chinese painting is the art of painting on a piece of Xuan paper or silk with a Chinese brush that was soaked with black ink or colored pigments. It is regarded as one of the three “quintessence of Chinese culture”. Chinese paintings are usually in the form of hanging pictures or of horizontal scrolls, in both cases they are normally kept rolled up. The latter paintings, often of great length, are unrolled bit by bit and enjoyed as a reader enjoys reading a manuscript.There is no fixed or standard viewpoint or perspective. Chinese painting is far less concerned with notions of symmetry, balance and proportion than its European counterpart. Because it lacks a single focal point, Chinese artists are free to paint on long strips of paper (or silk) and can compose pieces of amazing complexity in a rather comic book-like manner.Artists could paint a whole chain of pictures to depict continuous scenery. Many pictures include objects that are both far away and near, but they are depicted as being of the same size. It is more likely that the artists were trying to paint life exactly as they saw it. The presentation was held at OUC, 2017.",['shs']
Bayesian source localization with uncertain Green’s function,"The localization of an acoustic source in the oceanic waveguide is a difficult task because the oceanic environment is often poorly known. Uncertainty in the environment results in uncertainty in the source position and poor localization results. Hence, localization methods dealing with environmental uncertainty are required. In this paper, a Bayesian approach to source localization is introduced in order to improve robustness and obtain quantitative measures of localization uncertainty. The Green’s function of the waveguide is considered as an uncertain random variable whose probability density accounts for environmental uncertainty. The uncertain distribution over range and depth is then obtained through the integration of the posterior probability density (PPD) over the Green’s function probability density. An efficient integration technique makes the whole localization process computationally efficient. Some results are presented for a simple uncertain Green’s function model to show the ability of the proposed method to give reliable PPDs.",['spi']
Some evidence from the geographical analysis of agri-urban fringes and farm-city interactions. A French perspectiveEléments d’analyse géographique des franges agri-urbaines et des interactions ville-campagne. Une perspective française,"The lecture is focused on 5 short geographical questions in concern with the rural-urban interface. First, at metropolitan scale, the main food industries are not necessarily located in the main cities, and that means that agricultural centralities and regional centralities are often disconnected. Second, through the food short supply chains, the disconnection between cities and their agricultural surroundings is challenged by farmers we call, following Augustin Berque’s theory, ecumenal mediators. Third, it is possible to get a more acute comprehension of agri-urban interactions by drawing an analysis of their spatial interfaces. Fourth, access to the countryside by city dwellers is a major issue of social interaction (out of the few countries were trespass is an offence). Fifth, the urban agriculture, defined as the agriculture conducted and experienced in an agglomeration by farmers and inhabitants at the scale of their lived space or at the scale of the local public policies, is opening new opportunities for urban planning.La communication propose 5 approches géographiques à propos de l’interface rural-urbain. Premièrement, à l’échelle métropolitaine, les bassins de productions ne se superposent généralement pas aux aires urbaines. Deuxièmement, au travers des circuits courts, la déconnection entre les villes et leur ceinture agricole est combattue par des agriculteurs que nous appelons, en suivant Augustin Berque, des médiateurs écouménaux. Troisièmement, il est possible de mieux comprendre les rapports agri-urbains en traçant l’analyse de leur interface spatialisé. Quatrièmement, les loisirs en espace agricole des citadins sont un enjeu majeur d’interaction sociale (sauf dans les quelques pays où le « trespass » est un délit). Cinquièmement, l’agriculture urbaine, définie comme l’agriculture conduite et vécue dans une agglomération par des agriculteurs et des habitants à l’échelle de leur espace vécu ou à l’échelon des politiques publiques locales, ouvre de nouvelles perspectives d’aménagement urbain",['shs']
Policy design and technological substitution: Investigating the REACH regulation in an agent-based model,"This article proposes an agent-based model to study the impact of the European regulation REACH on industrial dynamics. This new regulation was adopted in 2006 and establishes a new philosophy of how to design environmental protection and health, especially through the authorization process and the extended producer responsibility. The main contribution of this article is to investigate how different combinations of flexible and stringent mechanisms create the incentives and constraints to shape market selection and innovation. The model outcomes stress that (1) stringency is the most determining feature of policy design (timing is also decisive but it appears to be of secondary importance); (2) technology substitution that brings radical technological change and significant pollution reduction is possible only if regulation is stringent enough but after many sacrifices, especially in terms of market concentration and number of failures; and (3) soft regulation does not lead to technology transition because of weak incentive and selection effects.",['shs']

Impact of charged species transport coefficients on self-bias voltage in an electrically asymmetric RF discharge,"In this paper, we use a fluid model to simulate the excitation of a hydrogen radio-frequency discharge, and employ tailored voltage waveforms to assess the effect of charged species transport properties. Results of the fluid simulation are compared with experimental data and previous results obtained with a hybrid model. Several expressions for electron and ion transport coefficients are compared, and their impact on the self-bias potential is studied. The self-bias is shown to be insensitive to the choice of electron transport coefficients, while remarkably sensitive to variations in ion mobility. Besides, our results show that fluid models can be competitive with hybrid models, provided self-consistent ion transport models and rate constants are used.",['phys']

Erosion of the molecular network in the amorphous layers of polyethylene upon high- strain deformation,"Samples of linear polyethylene, neat and crosslinked by irradiation with electron beam, were subjected to heavy plastic deformation by plane-strain compression up to the true strain exceeding 2 (deformation ratio λ > 8) at room temperature. Structural studies of deformed samples and investigation of long-term strain recovery demonstrated that the deformation of the neat, non-crosslinked HDPE is completely reversible above the melting point of the crystalline phase, provided that the applied true strain does not exceed e = 1.0 (λ = 2.7). At higher applied strains, e > 1, an irreversible deformation component emerged gradually, and at e = 2.1 (λ = 8.2), the permanent, truly irreversible, residual strain was approx. eres = 0.36 (λ = 1.4). In contrast, samples of crosslinked HDPE above Tm exhibited complete reversibility of deformation, irrespectively of an applied strain, and eres ≈ 0. The source of permanent irreversible strain component in neat HDPE is a deformation-induced partial destruction of the molecular network of entangled chains within amorphous interlamellar layers. The principal mechanism found was chain disentanglement, which was supplemented by a very limited chain scission. In the case of crosslinked materials, the dense and relatively homogeneous molecular network appeared robust enough to avoid any damage. Consequently, the strain appeared here fully reversible upon melting of crystalline phase.","['chim', 'spi']"
Effect of grain direction on cutting forces and chip geometry during green beech wood machining,"Proper valorization of the sawing wastes in industrial sawmills is a permanent issue with strong economic and environmental stakes. Most industrial sawmills are equipped with chipper-canter heads reducing the outer part of the logs into chips used in the pulp and paper industry. Optimization in canter use would increase the acceptable proportion of exploitable chips for this industry. With chipper-canters, the cutting direction varies along the cut. This study investigates the impact of the angle formed between the cutting direction and the grain direction on the required cutting force and the chips’ geometry. Orthogonal cutting is conducted to simulate the chipper-canter machining operation on green beech. To lower the cutting forces when machining, aiming for a cutting direction as parallel as possible to the wood fiber is necessary. However, if this angle is too low, the chips’ generated geometries prevent them from a proper valorization of this resource. A compromise with grain direction between 50° to 70° both limits the cutting forces and improves the steadiness of the chip fragmentation.",['spi']

Stability of zinc stearate under alpha irradiation in the manufacturing process of SFR nuclear fuels,"The manufacture of new fuels for sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) will involve powders derived from recycling existing fuels in order to keep on producing electricity while saving natural resources and reducing the amount of waste produced by spent MOX fuels. Using recycled plutonium in this way will significantly increase the amount of 238Pu, a high energy alpha emitter, in the powders. The process of shaping powders by pressing requires the use of a solid lubricant, zinc stearate, to produce pellets with no defects compliant with the standards. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of alpha radiolysis on this additive and its lubrication properties. Experiments were conducted on samples in contact with PuO2, as well as under external helium ion beam irradiation, in order to define the kinetics of radiolytic gas generation. The yield results relating to the formation of these gases (G0) show that the alpha radiation of plutonium can be simulated using external helium ion beam irradiation. The isotopic composition of plutonium has little impact on the yield. However, an increased yield was globally observed with increasing the mean linear energy transfer (LET). A radiolytic degradation process is proposed.","['chim', 'spi']"

"The Territory Agronomy Approach in research, education and training","Farming Systems Research has three core characteristics: it builds on systems thinking, it depends on the close collaboration between social and biophysical sciences, and it relies on participation to build co-learning processes. Farming Systems Research posits that to contribute towards sustainable rural development, both interdisciplinary collaborations and local actor engagement are needed. Together, they allow for changes in understanding and changes in practices.This book gives an overview of the insights generated in 20 years of Farming Systems Research. It retraces the emergence and development of Farming Systems Research in Europe, summarises the state-of-the-art for key areas, and provides an outlook on new explorations, especially those tackling the dynamic nature of farming systems and their interaction with the natural environment and the context of action.We hope this book will serve as an inspiration for all those who seek an alternative approach to research in farming and rural development. One that builds on the reflexivity of researchers, one that takes the role of human subjectivities and perceptions seriously, one that gives voice to farmers, one that emphasises participation and co-learning processes, one that focuses on interactions between the elements, one that allows to capture interdependencies and their dynamics.There is no doubt that Farming Systems Research has much to offer to answer the challenges faced by rural areas in the current turbulent and uncertain times. The book is thus aimed at practitioners, at graduate students and at researchers who seek new inspiration outside the mainstream, who take into account the ethical dimension of their work, and who seek encouragement to deepen their reflexivity about the meaning of professional practice and about their approach to research.","['sde', 'shs']"
Hierarchical micromechanical modeling of the viscoelastic behavior coupled to damage in SMC and SMC-hybrid composites,"The aim of this paper is to study, through a multiscale analysis, the viscoelastic behavior of glass reinforced sheet molding compound (SMC) composites and SMC-hybrid composites mixing two types of bundle reinforcement: glass and carbon fibers. SMC exhibit more than two distinct characteristic length scales, so that a sequence of scale transitions is required to obtain the overall behavior of the composite. An analytical procedure is used consisting of properly selected well-established micromechanical methods like the Mori-Tanaka (MTM) and the composite cylinders (CCM) accounting for each scale transition. After selecting a representative volume element (RVE) for each scale, the material response of any given length scale is described on the basis of the homogenized behavior of the next finer one. This hierarchical approach is appropriately extended to the viscoelastic domain to account for the time dependent overall response of the SMC composite material. The anisotropic damage has been introduced through a micromechanical model considering matrix penny-shape microcrack density inside bundles. The capabilities of the hierarchical modeling are illustrated with various parametric studies and simulation of experimental data for glass-based SMC composites.",['spi']

Experimental studies of Portevin-Le Chatelier plastic instabilities in carbon-manganese steels by infrared pyrometry,"The dynamic strain aging (DSA) phenomenon that occurs in some materials under certain temperature and strain rate conditions can cause plastic strain localization in the form of Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) bands. Carbon-manganese steels are used commonly and frequently in construction because of their ductility, low cost and ability to form mechanically. In these steels, the DSA phenomenon occurs for common quasi-static strain rates from 150 to 300 °C, which makes band observation complicated. PLC bands on a carbon-manganese steel that was sensitive to DSA were studied using an infrared camera. Specimen heating was achieved using an induction furnace (with an adapted coil inductor), which allows for temperature recording during tensile tests. Thermography with an infrared camera was used to estimate the band characteristics and increments in band plastic strain, which is an important parameter for material behavior identification necessary for DSA phenomenon modeling. This technique had been developed only for PLC phenomenon observation at ambient temperature on aluminum alloys. Band characteristics on the carbon-manganese steels have been compared with results obtained previously on aluminum alloys.",['spi']
"Lands, cities and campaigns face to the climate change and urban sprawl : an innovative IT platform and forecasting decision support tool for local authorities.","The European PRECOS project, that it has just start, proposes an innovative IT platform and forecasting decision support tool (Astuce &Tic) giving a synthetized vision of an area, measuring in real time, pressures, resilience potential and tipping points over natural resource assets and helping to manage ecosystem services under mounting climate and anthropogenic pressures. This has potential for radically transforming land management and resources based services and facilitating the transition of local stakeholders and economic actors to the quaternary economy. The Astuce & Tic approach is the result of a public private collaborative R&D project, financed with the help of French national and regional financing programs between 2008 and 2011. It developed IT tools to model and simulate the complex interactions between economic development, land allocation, climate, underground water, agriculture and irrigation, and applied them on a demonstration area: the Crau area in south of France. On Crau area, we demonstrate that (i) urban sprawl uses up significant surfaces of natural and farmland and we show that between 1997 and 2009 up to 1600 ha have been irreversibly destroyed; (ii) grasslands’ gravity irrigation is a sustainability factor in the area and (iii) agricultural activities are a source of vital ecosystems services and contribute to 75% of the renewal of groundwaters. In a prospective vision to 2030 horizon, the Astuce & Tic approach put to light the fact that the consumption of land resources for economic activities generated too much strain on the water cycle and that, if nothing major is done, in less than twenty years, underground water would function in a reverse mode, i.e. that salt will progressively poison the ground making centuries of efforts wasted in no time. This example highlights both the dramatic reality that the competition for urban land may take, and also the fact that the impact may not always be noticed on the local scale and that governance must also be effective at more global scale than the level of prima facie decision.",['sde']
Diversification of current plant protection strategies to mitigate climate change effects,"Climate change is increasingly perceived as one of the major constraints that limit agricultural productivity. Crop losses due to climate change could be direct, such as damages through flooding or storms, or indirect such as altered distribution of crop pests. The real impact of climate change at global level is yet uncertain and likely variable from one region to another. Within this context, it is difficult to predict effects of climate change, particularly when long-term datasets from the past are missing to develop and test predictive models for the future. Nevertheless, our knowledge of plant-disease interactions, population genetics of pathogens as well as crops, and examples of overwhelming establishment of new diseases in a given region provides insights into how climate change may affect disease incidence and severity. Here we report examples of pest populations which have been established across regions previously considered detrimental for their survival and yield losses associated to these pests. Faced with the uncertainty regarding the effects of changing climate on crop protection, here we propose a number of action points that, to our opinion, may help improve current plant protection strategies. Given this uncertainty, policy, research, and extension should be prepared to promote resilience vis-à-vis pests which, at the biophysical level, entails uncovering what currently makes cropping systems resilient, while at the organizational level, the capacity to adapt needs to be recognized and strengthened (Lamichhane et al 2014). Such action points include increase in human resources, development of resilient cropping systems, more focus on crop-weed competition, anticipating of risks and international monitoring, and more effort on breeding for resistance, development of biological control strategies and pest risks analysis. This diversification could be achieved by improving current plant protection practices which might help mitigate the effect of climate change in future crop protection, particularly in the EU, but also at global level. The vision presented here is that of the ENDURE European Research Group, which brings together some of Europe’s leading agricultural research, teaching, and extension institutes with a special interest in IPM.",['sdv']

"High rate, fast timing Glass RPC for the high {\eta} CMS muon detectors",The HL-LHC phase is designed to increase by an order of magnitude the amount of data to be collected by the LHC experiments. To achieve this goal in a reasonable time scale the instantaneous luminosity would also increase by an order of magnitude up to $6.10^{34} cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ . The region of the forward muon spectrometer ($|{\eta}| > 1.6$) is not equipped with RPC stations. The increase of the expected particles rate up to $2 kHz/cm^{2}$ (including a safety factor 3) motivates the installation of RPC chambers to guarantee redundancy with the CSC chambers already present. The actual RPC technology of CMS cannot sustain the expected background level. The new technology that will be chosen should have a high rate capability and provides a good spatial and timing resolution. A new generation of Glass-RPC (GRPC) using low-resistivity (LR) glass is proposed to equip at least the two most far away of the four high ${\eta}$ muon stations of CMS. First the design of small size prototypes and studies of their performance in high-rate particles flux is presented. Then the proposed designs for large size chambers and their fast-timing electronic readout are examined and preliminary results are provided.,['phys']

Shear Wave Elastography can evaluate Annulus Fibrosus Alteration in Adolescent Scoliosis,"Objectives In vitro studies showed that annulus fibrosus lose its integrity in idiopathic scoliosis. Shear wave ultrasound elastography can be used for noninvasive measurement of shear wave speed (SWS) in vivo in the annulus fibrosus, a parameter related to its mechanical properties. The main aim was to assess SWS in lumbar annulus fibrosus of scoliotic adolescents and compare it to healthy subjects. Methods SWS was measured in 180 lumbar IVDs (L3L4, L4L5, L5S1) of thirty healthy adolescents (13 yo ± 1.9) and thirty adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients (13 yo ± 2, Cobb angle: 28.8° ± 10.4°). SWS was compared between scoliosis and healthy control group. Results In healthy subjects, average SWS (all disc levels pooled) was 3.0 ± 0.3 m/s whereas, in scoliotic patients it was significantly higher at 3.5 ± 0.3 m/s (p = 0.0004; Mann-Whitney test). Differences were also significant at all disc levels. No difference was observed between males and females. No correlation was found with age, weight and height. Conclusion Non-invasive shear wave ultrasound is a novel method of assessment to quantitative alteration of annulus fibrosus. These preliminary results are promising to consider shear wave elastography as a biomechanical marker for assessment of idiopathic scoliotic.","['sdv', 'spi']"
Efficient excitation of photoluminescence in a two-dimensional waveguide consisting of a quantum dot-polymer sandwich-type structure,"In this Letter, we study a new kind of organic polymer waveguide numerically and experimentally by combining an ultrathin (10–50 nm) layer of compactly packed CdSe/ZnS core/shell colloidal quantum dots (QDs) sandwiched between two cladding poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layers. When a pumping laser beam is coupled into the waveguide edge, light is mostly confined around the QD layer, improving the efficiency of excitation. Moreover, the absence of losses in the claddings allows the propagation of the pumping laser beam along the entire waveguide length; hence, a high-intensity photoluminescence (PL) is produced. Furthermore, a novel fabrication technology is developed to pattern the PMMA into ridge structures by UV lithography in order to provide additional light confinement. The sandwich-type waveguide is analyzed in comparison to a similar one formed by a PMMA film homogeneously doped by the same QDs. A 100-fold enhancement in the waveguided PL is found for the sandwich-type case due to the higher concentration of QDs inside the waveguide.",['spi']

"Crowdsourcing for innovation: from knowledge capture to knowledge integration, the key role of absorptive capacities","Crowdsourcing (CS) for innovation is defined as the outsourcing of problem solving or creative tasks to the crowd. The literature points out the benefits for developing absorptive capacities (ACAP). In this specific open CS context, little is known about the integrative actions for this external knowledge. This explorative research tries to fill this gap by considering five cases of CS for innovation. When implementing CS for innovation, we show that firms succeed in developing potential absorptive capacities (acquisition and assimilation of the crowd’s knowledge), yet experience significant difficulties in developing realized absorptive capacities (transformation and exploitation of the crowd’s knowledge). Integrative actions implemented during the realized absorptive capacities (RACAP) step are not sufficiently strong to create new value with captured knowledge, and other factors like organizational integration should be considered.",['shs']
Physical and Chemical Characteristics of Rice Straw,"This study aims to determine the physical characteristics of rice straw and highlights the presence of sugar in rice straw. The use of natural fibers as a reinforcement in construction has existed for millennia. They are mixed with clay to make building materials. This addition avoids cracks and sometimes contributes to flexural strength. Researchers have detected a high level of sugar in natural fibers. This sugar contained in the biomass is at the origin of the setting delay and the hardening of the building materials. Another not least significant defect found in natural fiber is its high water absorption potential. This hydrophilic character is due to the intrinsic porosity of the straws. This article aims to determine the physical characteristics of rice straw and highlights the presence of sugar in rice straw. First, the density and water absorption rate of the rice straw were determined. Then chemical tests were carried out to determine the rate of mineral constituents (ash), lignin, hemicellulose and finally the rate of cellulose is deduced. Like most crop straws, rice straw contains a high level of sugar. It also has a very low density compared to other building materials. It is around 450 kg/m3 . Rice straw also has a high water absorption rate. The absorption rate absorption rate (At) 5 min of immersion in water, its absorption rate reaches 234%.",['spi']

A Technical Approach of Image Segmentation in ENVI GIS to Identify Thematic Clusters for Visualization of Urban Transformations,"The technical study objective is to apply segmentation techniques for clustering image into thematic areas. The data used in this research included Landsat TM and ETM+ multi-band imagery covering chosen research area. The image processing was performed using supervised classification in GIS software. The technical aim of the research is image classification which consists in automatic assignation of all pixels on an image into land cover classes that are typical for this study area. The logical algorithmic approach of clustering segmentation was applied to identify clusters for thematic mapping of land cover types in the selected study area. While using data for spatial modelling and mapping, specific study objectives should always be evaluated, hence the model may have certain limitations and dependencies on the scale and resolution. the satellite scenes of Landsat TM with middle-sized resolution and open distribution have been taken for the research as available and appropriate images for current objective. The data pre-processing include image contrast stretching, which is useful as by default, ENVI displays images with a 2% linear contrast stretch. For better contrast the histogram equalization contrast stretch was applied to the image in order to enhance the visual quality. The number of clusters was assigned to 15, which responds to the selected land cover types in the study area. These cluster centers were then located within the study area. During clustering procedure, each digital pixel on the image is categorized to the respecting cluster, to which the mean DN value of the given pixel is the closest. Upon classification of all pixels in such a way, the revised mean vectors for each of the clusters were computed. The process has been repeated in an iterative way until optimal values of the class groups are received and pixels are assigned to the corresponding classes.",['info']
"Impacts of Climate Change on Landscapes in Central Europe, Hungary","The study area is located in Central Europe and focusing on Mecsek Hills, a low mountain range in the south western part of Hungary. The region of central Europe includes complex mis of elements from mediterranean and continental climate, since the area is located in transitional zone of sub-atlantic and sub-mediterranean climate types. Mecsek Hills is a unique region of the Hungarian environment. Its central European location specifies distribution of diverse landscape types, formed under conditions of transitional climatic settings, mixed from sub-atlantic to sub-mediterranean. The distribution of ecosystems in the region illustrate adaptation of soil properties to actual climate conditions. As determined by the present-day climatic and geomorphological settings, soils in the Mecsek region are rich in nutrients, and landscapes are characterized by various mixed soil types. Brown forest soils predominate on hilltops of Mecsek, while alluvial soils on floodplains. According to the underlying soil types, the landscapes are characterized by mixed vegetation types. The most typical is Pannonian mixed forests of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, common in Euro-Siberian region. There are also forests of Turkey and hornbeam oak in the catchment area of Mecsek region. The dominating vegetation coverage types on the slopes of Mecsek Hills include beech forests, ravine forests and oaks. Some regions of the Mecsek Hills include unique biogeographic areas with endemic species, not founded elsewhere in Carpathian Basin. The overall climate change, especially the global temperature increase, controls balance of heat and water budget on the Hungarian landscapes, and has considerable impact on the agricultural landscapes. In the past decades there were changes in climate, detected in the Carpathian Basin region, which illustrate general fluctuations in the climatic settings in Hungary and change of overall average air temperatures. Combination of the satellite images with GIS techniques is a key method for land patterns identification and classification of ecosystems. Research methodology is based on the GIS spatial analysis tools and classification of Landsat TM image, which was used for visualizing landscapes. An ILWIS GIS was applied to perform spatial analysis and mapping. The research algorithm is clustering, which classifies pixels with similar value of Digital Numbers (DNs) to thematic classes. As a result, spatial analysis on distribution of land cover patterns was performed. Data processing include image pre-processing, enhancement, classification, spatial analysis and interpretation. A land cover map was created by classifying study area into land categories. The core method used in the current work for the interpretation of imagery is clustering algorithm. This method is based on the remote sensing general principle that each unique pixel on a multichannel image has spectral signature defined by the reflectance of its DN in each spectral band. The DNs of pixels create unique signatures for various objects, distinguishable from other objects. Multispectral cluster classification was applied for the Landsat TM image, by extracting information about values of the pixels DNs, analyzing their spectral signatures. Current work demonstrated analysis of climate factors affecting ecological settings of Mecsek Hulls, and local landscapes visualized by means of ILWIS GIS and remote sensing data (Landsat TM). The results consist in recognized distribution of land use patterns. ILWIS GIS is a convenient open source GIS, useful for spatial analysis and land use monitoring. Clustering method is useful for ecological mapping, since it enables objective identification of the land types in regions characterized by high land heterogeneity and complex structure, such as agricultural fields mixed with natural land cover types. The experience of Landsat TM imagery processing by means of ILWIS GIS, described in the current work, is a contribution towards agricultural mapping.","['info', 'shs']"
"Using GIS for Monitoring Lacustrine Ecosystem: a Case Study of Laguna de Gallocanta, Spain","Current research presents study of the hydrological characteristics in the surroundings of the Laguna de Gallocanta (Spain) using remote sensing methods and combination of two GIS: ArcGIS and Idrisi GIS. The methodology includes following workflow: 1) selection of the multi-temporal Landsat images and creating color composites; 2) Masking and overlaying study area out of the whole image; 3) Calculation of the direction and length of stream flow in the lake basin; 4) assessment of possible risks of floods and stability of coastal slopes. The research has aim of hydrological assessment testing GIS tools for environmental monitoring. The images are presented by Landsat ETM+, MSS and TM scenes acquired on years 1976, 1987, 1992 and 2000, respectively, with a cloud cover of 0%. The images were georeferenced in ArcGIS and rectified to the Grid Coordinate System using available vector layers. The georeferenced rectified image was then re-projected to the UTM projection WGS84 datum. The combinations of various bands (channels 2-1-4, 5-4-7, and 2-4-7) were tested and visualized. Second step included processing DEM (Digital Elevation Model) Data acquired by the SRTM providing high quality elevation data. The pre-processing included mosaicing images and cutting out study area. The hydrologically conditioning the DEM was performed: the elevations are modified in order to model flow directions. Modelling flow direction and flow accumulation was performed on the conditioned DEM using ArcGIS. The next step included extracting hydrologic features such as stream directions, length and basin extents from a DEM. The pit removal tool was used to remove error pits from a DEM. Final step included calculations of the flow direction and flow length that demonstrate the direction of flow out of each cell. Finally, using Basin function all cells belonging to the watersheds of one or more target cells were calculated. The results shown that area has sensitive hydrological settings which explains its prone to the environmental change. The research demonstrated successful use of GIS for the purposes of hydrological modeling in the environmental studies.","['info', 'phys', 'sde', 'shs']"

"Landscape metrics as indicator for ecological significance: assessment of Sitno Natura 2000 sites, Slovakia","The study area is Sitno Nature 2000 Site. The “Natura 2000” framework focuses on conservation of valuable landscapes and nature, aims at the sustainable conservation of Europe’s biodiversity and species richness across Europe. The development of a Natura 2000 ecological network is important policy initiative in support of protected sites. Sitno Natura 2000 study area is located in central Slovakia. It has been selected for the richness of its natural environment and anthropogenic impacts. For the last 30 years the areas has been used for the tourism and transmitting of digital and analogue data by army and commercial sphere. Therefore, there was built and developed technical infrastructure. The highest place of the study area called Sitno peak (1009 m), which is very popular and attractive tourism (walking and climbing). Presently, the area is under high priority nature and landscape protection. The area is needed to be zoned separately for human usage and for conservation. Ecological significance of landscape should be the zonation tool in terms of the framework Nature 2000. It is an objective approach to determine ecological values owners, local communities and state organizations. This paper analyses landscape components (habitats), where human impacts are detected due to the intensive tourism. The landscape elements can be defined by attributes of the Earth’s surface as well as by ecological significance of each one land's surface elements. Landscape represents biophysical unit – an aspect of landscape which is determined by its natural components: geological and geomorphologic structure, soil, water, climate, flora and vegetation, fauna. In contrast to the biophysical unit, the term landscape describes elements that are determined by natural conditions as well as human impacts. The main purpose of this study is therefore to measure and interpret landscape's habitats of the study area. Methodological framework of ecological signification is based on quantifying habitats and their patches. Each landscape element can be measured by landscape metrics, e.g. size, density, shape, edge, diversity. The outputs values from landscape metrics directly indicate the quality of the on-going ecological processes at different levels. The result of the quantification process is interpreted by the degree of ecological significance of the landscape elements. The basis of the methodological framework is measurement of landscape elements according to principles of landscape metrics. Most of the landscape metrics are based on the mathematical–statistical approach that measures area, perimeter, length and shape. On the base of the measured variables each habitat's patches were interpreted towards a quality of the on-going ecological processes. The output of the interpretation is determined by the level of ecological significance in the following levels: 1) Very significant land cover patches 2) Significant land cover patches 3) Moderately significant land cover patches 4) Almost insignificant land cover patches 5) Insignificant land cover patches.","['info', 'sde']"
"Opportunities for Classes of Geography in the High School: the Use of ’CORINE’ Project Data, Satellite Images and IDRISI GIS for Geovisualization","Presented work illustrates application of the GIS based processing of various geographic data: satellite images and CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) layers at the lessons of geography in the high schools and universities. The research illustrates GIS application for understanding, visualizing and modeling landscapes of the Earth. Practically, the work aims to demonstrate students, how mapping land cover types can be done using GIS and combination of vector and raster geospatial data. Practical example of this work is application of IDRISI GIS and geospatial data towards a study region, located on the coasts of the Baltic Sea: Pärnu region. The GIS project was performed using Landsat TM satellite image and thematic CORINE layers showing land cover and vegetation types. The CORINE project was started in 1985 in the European Union (EU). This is a cartographic database common and standardized for the EU. The project consists of 44 land cover types in classes, presented as a series of maps at a scale of 1:100 000. This database is available for the most areas of Europe (EU) including Estonia. The image was classified according to the European system of CORINE Land Cover Project classification. The CORINE map was used for the interpretation of this classification. Following this methodology the ""training areas"" were created, i.e. key regions, typical for the landscape types. In totally, 14 land cover types were classified. Classification is based on the detection of land use types. The final result is thematic map of landscape types made using cartographic methods. The work demonstrated how the ecosystems can be studied using combination of CORINE, GIS and remote sensing by the students at the classes of geography at high schools.","['info', 'sde', 'shs']"

Urban-Rural Environmental Gradient in a Developing City: Testing ENVI GIS Functionality,"The research performs urban ecosystem analysis supported by ENVI GIS by integrated studies on land cover types and geospatial modeling of Taipei city. The paper deals with the role of anthropogenic pressure on the structure of the landscape and change of land cover types. Methods included assessment of the impact from anthropogenic activities on the natural ecosystems, evaluation of the rate and scale of landscape dynamics using remote sensing data and GIS. The research aims to assist environmentalists and city planners to evaluate strategies for specific objectives of urban development in Taiwan, China. The study aims at the assessment of the landscape development and environmental analysis of the Taipei city based on GIS and remote sensing methods. Methodology includes analysis of the environmental settings of the Taiwan region (land cover characteristics, climatic and topographic settings) and anthropogenic factors of the social landscapes. Research objectives included GIS based geo-visualization, spatial analysis of the raster data, i.e. satellite images and. Different factors involved in the landscape formation were studied and analyzed, both individually and in combination. The paper studies urban processes in Taipei in general and how GIS and remote sensing data can be used for the spatial analysis. The research deals with classification and analysis of the selected landscapes in Taiwanese ecosystems, and suggest development of the effective methods for wetlands assessment using a multi-metric approach. The research included analysis of the degree of landscapes disturbance according to the calculated metrics index values for specific land-use categories within the landscapes. The interplay between both parts of the ecosystem, i.e. the anthropogenic impacts of the global city on the one side, and ecological patterns and processes on the other, is aimed to achieve balanced mutual coexistence within the global ecosystems. Modified land use types affect hydrological components in the surrounding watersheds and results in changes of the land use patterns, namely, landscape composition, configuration, connectivity, variety and abundance of patch types within a landscape, which are the primary descriptors of the landscape pattern. The complex functioning, structure and interrelationships of the landscape components in urban ecosystem are largely influenced by the anthropogenic activities, inasmuch as the population concentrate in the metropolises and large cities. The location of Taipei in the southern subtropical humid climatic zone largely influences its environmental settings. Various disasters and hazards associated with specific climate settings such as torrential rains, occasional floods, rainstorms, seasonal typhoons have serious impacts and environmental consequences on the city functioning. Frequent and intense typhoons together with stormy rains and floods are natural disasters specific for Taiwan. Consequences of hazards include significant property damage, destroyed farmlands, crashed roads, partially or completely destroyed houses, human injures, diseases and lives losses. Urban landscapes of Taipei are being formed during long historical process, as a result of the ongoing entangled interactions between natural forces and anthropogenic social factors. Methodologically, current study is focused on technical approach of raster data processing. There are numerous classification algorithms and techniques that determine natural spectral groups from the initial pixels sets: Parallelepiped classification, Neural Nets, Decision Trees, Mahalanobis Distance, Minimum Distance, and Maximum Likelihood classifiers, ISOCLUST, K-means. Usually, it is not easy to decide, which classifier method is a priori the best cartographic solution for actual research problem, due to different factors that vary significantly: characteristics of raster images, mapping scales, specific situation of the study area, reflectance properties of the local land cover types, landscape structure and heterogeneity. Results: A report on the statistics was generated and recorded as an 'Error Matrix', 'Kappa Statistics' and 'Accuracy'. Afterwards, to visually inspect classification process, the selected areas with the most diverse landscape structure and high heterogeneity of the land cover types were verified and validated by the overlapping of the Google Earth using activated function “connect to Google Earth”. The “Link Google Earth to View” and “Sync Google Earth to View” options enabled to synchronize the view areas between the Google Earth and current image view. This enabled to check up highly heterogeneous areas where questions about land cover type arose. The land cover types were visually assessed and identified. The resulting clusters enabled to analyze spectral and textural characteristics of the land cover types in the selected area. Based on cluster segmentation, homogenous land cover classes were differentiated.","['info', 'shs']"

Linking Data Between the Worksheets and GIS Databases for Effective Management of the Environmental Projects,"The paper focuses on the spatial and attributive data structuring, sorting and effective organizing by means of GIS. Introduction. The effective organization of the data and linking various formats for smart environmental data management is the aim of this work. The research has been done during author's research stay at the Biogeochemistry Group of the Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, University of Kuopio (Eastern Finland). Updating and structuring geodatabase, and data linking from different projects is the essential part of the environmental data management. 1. Data compilation and preparing for the database. The available thematic tables were compiled and stored on a computer, dedicated for database management. These data are mostly MS Excel thematic tables containing several different data: climatic, soil, chemical elements, relevant emissions or flux data (CO2, N2O and CH4). The data were saved in their initial form and used for the main table 'Measurements.xls' containing all information in a standard form. All tables contain their metadata on the projects (coordinates, place and date of the measurements, researcher ID, publications from previous projects etc). The standards for the main table were set up: number, contain and form of the thematic fields. The data were organized according to their requirements and suggestions about the intended database structure. After analysing the data content, the table 'Metadata_Finland.xls' containing common following fields with the explanation of their meaning was created. Once the data are organized in a geodatabase by the workspace, they enables logical and spatial operations: controlling access to datasets with measurements; providing transaction framework for updating and sharing datasets when new data received at the fieldwork; organizing, documentation and storing in a catalog geographic datasets. Final content in the Geodatabase workspace includes: ArcGIS files, e.g. Finland.mxd ArcMap with the Finland shape files (.shp) and maplayer files (.lyr), External datasets of Excel tables; Subfolders containing file geodatabases in different coordinate systems (Finnish national and world ArcGIS coordinate system), Microsoft Access files (.mdb) containing personal geodatabase. Current research demonstrated effective data management for environmental research. So far, the data were stored by individual researchers responsible for their own projects. Now the data are collected together in a very structured system. Thus, it is possible to add further information and relevant data into this database systematically and to use them for the thematic research. The necessary amendments or additions of the information can be done as new data from the field expeditions become available. The data of both terrestrial and acquatic ecosystems of Finland with the key information of fluxes measurements of chemical elements (CO2, N2O, CH4) are collected in one main Table Measurements.xls with a separate catalogue of all this data: Metadata_Finland.xls containing essencial information and site codes.",['info']
Environmental Hazard Prevention: Monitoring and Control of Landslide Risks in Mountainous Forests,"This paper analyses optimal methods for the estimation of the environmental hazards with a case study of landslides causing degradation of the mountainous forest ecosystems. The aim of this work is analysis of possible methods of estimating consequences caused by environmental hazards affecting forest ecosystems. Methodological advances have been made in regional applications of landslides risk studies , including specific research questions, such as vulnerability estimation, economic estimation of the losses, assessment of risk perception and social aspects of risk, cartographic aspects of risk mapping, as well as elaboration of the methodology of the overall risk assessment. The GIS-based mapping is undoubtedly indispensable tool for landslide risk studies, applicable both for spatial and temporal aspect of the hazard risk assessment. Many successful examples of landslide risk assessment and susceptibility analysis based on GIS mapping were done, as well as calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Various example of the thematic mapping of forest ecosystems are provided. For all that, the applications of the risk studies specifically for the mountainous forest landscapes mostly depend on hazard occurrence and data availability, accessibility, compatibility and integration. Usually, scientific reports focus on mountainous Alpine regions, which are well studied. The studies of risk assessment of natural hazards grew from the engineering branch of risk analysis and are being now rapidly developed since 1990s. The understanding of the concept ""risk"" varies at different authors, with the main difference in the degree of objectivity of risk concept: some authors define risk as independent and 'given' value, while others stress the influence of social factor on overall risk. According to the UNISDR, risk is a ""probability of harmful consequences, or expected losses (deaths, injures, property, livelihoods, economic activity disrupted or environment damaged) resulting from interactions between natural or human-induced hazards and vulnerable conditions"". When applying this general concept to the natural context, risk is defined as a product of hazard and vulnerability of the elements disposed to risk. Risk assessment is mainly focusing on risk management of natural hazards, i.e. with a main stress on human-environmental cooperation and coexistence. Management of risk aims to lessen the risk levels, and includes estimation of risk and actions to minimize overall risk level. The evaluation includes identification of main stakeholders and elements at risk, monetary values of losses, strengths, weaknesses of the elements at risk, significant factors in the environment, outcomes expected, established risk criteria. Risk identification involves examining all sources of risk from the perspective of all stakeholders. There are different methods of qualitative and quantitative assessment of landslide risk, including risk analysis, which aims at the identification of hazard consequences and defining possible endangered regions. The level of risk is the combination of the likelihood of a risk occurring and the consequences if it does occur. In the risk estimation there are proposed levels of risk identified for landslide hazards: intolerable, tolerable and acceptable. The results of risk analysis and assessment can considerably lessen potential consequences of landslide hazards. The landslide hazard is expressed as a limited probability that a landslide occurs within a given period of time. There are proposed method of the recurrent intervals for the definition of the landslide hazard zones. Methods of predicting dynamic movements of the landslides and estimating their temporal probability are not well elaborated yet and are hardly available. The assessment of temporal probability of landslides is very difficult to perform. The risk of landslide processes is strongly determined by the wide variety of different factors, among which is the slope angle. Other factors, associated with landslides, are geological structure, material characteristics, water pressure, topography, river erosion, and weathering. These are also important triggers in landslide formation and movements. All objects that can be affected by the landslides are usually defined as elements at risk: it can be humans and valuable objects located in the endangered area. It is assumed that elements at risk include buildings, infrastructure, services, property, population and environment. The population at risk is defined as a number of people present in dangerous areas, whose losses are expressed as health injury and deaths. The risk for population is estimated as possible losses of lives. The sustainable functioning of unique and sensitive forest ecosystems is highly adjusted towards climatic-environmental settings. The proper risk assessment of possible hazards should be included into the monitoring program for better understanding of ecosystem functioning and avoiding deforestation. Current paper contributed towards risk assessment studies by systematization of the existing methodology recommended for the environmental hazard assessment.","['shs', 'sdv', 'sde', 'phys']"

"Environmental Modelling of Coastal Cities: Urban Landscapes as Complex, Vulnerable and Dynamically Developing Structures","The study area is focused on the coastal city of Taipei. Since past decades, Taipei undergone serious urban changes as residential structure of the vacant land areas is developing and requires modifications. The development of urban landscapes in Taipei has unique feature; that is, the Taiwan’s exceptional economic and industrial growth since 1980s, which is often referred as «industrial wonder of Taiwan». The country quickly transformed from an agriculture- based traditional economy into a highly industrialized society. As a result, Taiwan has now a new face of high-technology oriented, economically restructured economy, which is a part of the global network of economies and capitals, playing important role both in the Asia–Pacific region and in the global production chains. Necessarily, this caused notable changes in the face of the country, modifying both its social and natural landscape patterns. Thus, Taiwan is nowadays a highly urbanized country with almost 80% of the total population of Taiwan living in urban areas. However, intensive urbanization necessarily create new conditions for human-nature co-existence, since rapidly growing city and high urbanization rate affect biodiversity and ecosystems sustainability in the coastal area. The process of urbanization includes transformation of landscapes: natural land cover types, typical for the area are being modified into artificial surfaces and the area of city enlarges. At the same time, Taiwan Island has unique natural landscapes with high environmental value, outstanding natural beauty, rare and extinct species. The landscape diversity is higher in the rural and less urbanized areas, while it increases in the urban areas due to the domination of the human-induced landscape types and reduced number of natural patches within the city. The environmental changes of the city were detected by geospatial analysis of the satellite images. The areas occupied by different landscape types were calculated and analyzed. It was detected that various districts were developing with different rate and intensity due to the complex factors of both human and ecological origin. The results showed urban development, decline of green areas, increase of urban spaces since 1990.","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"
"To the question of the environmental education: how Landsat TM, ETM+ and MSS images can be processed by GIS-techniques for geospatial research","The emphasis of this research is to demonstrate application of Landsat satellite imagery as a major resource for student and educational research. Landsat images are highly useful and strongly recommended for educational purposes as they are provided free of charge and timely regular geospatial data with 30-m resolution covering any places of the Earth. The case study describes mapping land cover types in ecosystems. It details how exactly satellite images can be used for geospatial research step by step. The research methodology is based spatial analysis tools of the open source GIS software: Quantum GIS and ILWIS GIS. The pre-processing of the imagery included data import and settings of colors and contrast. The contrast of the Landsat TM imagery has been enhanced using «Stretch To MinMax» function in QGIS viewer. The series of Landsat TM images, which cover Bovanenkovo region in Yamal peninsula with 30-m resolution, were initially stored as raster file in Erdas Imagine (.img) format. The images were imported to ILWIS from .img into ILWIS .mpr raster map format (ASCII) using GDAL. After converting, each image contained collection of 7 Landsat raster bands, as well as theirs metadata stored in Map List (.mpl) file, information about georeference (.grf) and coordinate system in .csy file. The coordinate systems of the Landsat imagery is based on the WGS 1984 datum. To improve the quality of image and visibility of coastal lines, the image enhancement of the Landsat bands was performed using Edge Enhancement linear filter from the Image Processing menu. Stretching filter was applied to the bands, in order to improve color contrast: since not all pixel values have been used in the image, the actual diapason range was stretched linearly to 0-255 values. To visualize spectral information from the Landsat image, a color composite map has been created using combination of three raster images of the individual bands. Supervised classification of the raster imagery includes image analysis aimed at recognizing class membership for each pixel. The main research method used in current research is supervised classification, which enabled to assign land cover classes by adjusting classification parameters and thresholds in DN values of spectral signature of pixels. The principle of Minimum Distance method, used for pixels classification is based on the calculating of shortest straight-line distance in Euclidian coordinate system from each pixel’s DN to the pattern pixels of land cover classes. The researched described successful application of Landsat remote sensing data and GIS for environmental studies.","['info', 'sde', 'shs']"
Innovations in the Geoscience Research: Classification of the Landsat TM Image Using ILWIS GIS for Geographic Studies,"Environmental mapping is a necessary tool for the geoscience research in the university classes of geography, GIS cartography and mapping. However, GIS methods of processing remote sensing data are often being discussed, and the optimal approaches are disputed. This work reports innovative approach of the processing Landsat TM satellite image in ILWIS GIS software using unsupervised and supervised classification methods. The methods of ILWIS GIS are compared and the results described in this paper. The methodology is based on the use of supervised classification of the satellite image, an innovative method in geographic research. Supervised classification of the raster imagery aimes at the recognizing of the class membership for each pixel during image analysis. The supervised classification of the multi-spectral imagery has been performed using 'Classify' operator in ILWIS applied to Landsat TM 1988. The classification process included following steps. First, the models of the classes were defined by creating a ""sample sat"" in ILWIS GIS. Namely, the training pixels with similar spectral values were defined and selected as representations for various classes. These pixels have contrasting colors, visually visible and distinguishable on the image, which serve as training areas for diverse classes. The sample pixels were defined in the Sample Set Editor in ILWIS, which was initially created in the main menu. A created Sample Set has a reference to the set of Landsat bands (1-7), which are needed to create sample statistics. After assigning pixel sets, a raster polygon map was automatically created with .mpr file extension. It contained sample pixels, location and legend, i.e. the names of the classes allocated to pixels. Easy interpretation of the image strongly depends on the optimal color composite map. The classification has been completed in interactive way, using several attempts of creating training samples, selecting various sample sets and respective pixels selected in Sample Set Editor using domain for classification ―Landclasses. The classification was repeated the until the final results were achieved. Shadows of green colors represent grass, shrub vegetation coverage and forest canopy. The results demonstrate successful application of the innovative approach of technical satellite image processing for the studies of the environment. The presented methods can be used by students of geography.","['info', 'sde', 'shs']"

"Assessing and Monitoring Geoecological Status of West Turkish Landscapes for Sustainable Development: Processes, Activities and Problems","The paper reviews current environmental problems of Izmir, Turkey. A third large metropolis of Turkey, Izmir is an industrial city of high importance for the country. It is a key seaport harbor, strategic for the country and the Mediterranean region in general, highly important for the transportation network within the Aegean, Marmara and the Mediterranean Seas. Izmir is also known as an important country’s business and fair trade center, where cross-cultural meetings, Expo exhibitions, international conferences, symposia and workshops being periodically organized. Therefore, the region has intensive anthropogenic activities: well developed transport network, intensive shipping and maritime construction, industrial factories and plants, urban densely populated districts, intensive agricultural cultivation. Nowadays, the most important problem in the Mediterranean basin, and in Aegean Sea area as its part, consists in land degradation. Thus, changes in climate conditions together with human impacts cause degradation of the semi-natural vegetation, which in turn, leads to the intensification of soil degradation, and finally causes erosion hazardous processes. The most important trigger factor for soil degradation is accelerated water erosion. Intensified by the destruction of the vegetation land cover and types, it increases desertification in the Mediterranean basin. Both soil and vegetation degradation are deeply interrelated, because the degree of soil degradation reflects the state of the vegetation that covers it: bare soils are being destroyed more quickly and intensively than the ones covered by forests or shrubs. The main issues of environmental current situation within the terrestrial ecosystems concern deforestation of precious forests communities, desertification and soils erosion and land degradation in the surroundings. The ecological threats to marine ecosystems include chemical contamination of the Izmir bay by detecting traces of mercury that originate from Gediz River and inactive mining sites (again, in Karaburun Peninsula) and come to shelf waters of the Aegean Sea. Apart from “usual” anthropogenic activities typical for the industrial city and its surroundings, the region is being intensively visited by tourists, both international and Turkish ones. The touristic attractiveness of the Izmir region is explained by its natural environmental settings, favorable climate conditions, scenic landscapes and cultural richness. The development of the tourism covers both traditional coastal areas and geothermal hot water springs. Both rich natural resources and human treasures of Izmir (traces of old civilizations, historical, archaeological and ethnographical cultural heritage), traditionally and deservedly attract large number of tourists in western Turkey all year round. This definitely has positive influence on the local economics and tourism development. However, the non-controlled anthropogenic pressure also has potential negative consequences. The described above multifold factors impact the environment, lead to the irreversible consequences, and cause destruction or loss of the elements within the ecosystems.","['sdv', 'phys', 'sde', 'shs']"
Analysis of Landsat NDVI time series for detecting degradation of vegetation,"Calculation of vegetation indices, especially Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), has become one of the most successful, popular and traditional attempts in biogeographical research methods, because NDVI has certain advantages over other vegetation indices or band combinations. Producing vegetation indices has been done in this research using mathematic calculation of the channels: (NIR-VIS) / (NIR+VIS), or a ratio for channels: (Band4-Band3) / (Band4 +Band3). Monitoring spatial distribution, presence and health conditions of the vegetation is traditionally being performed using calculation of the NDVI. To model the NDVI I used Map Calculation tool in command line of the Raster Operations menu in ILWIS GIS, which enables to perform spatial analysis and modeling by combination of queries, arithmetic expressions and overlays of selected raster images. The resulting images shows distribution of the vegetation over the Bovanenkovo region within three (3) years: 1988, 2001 and 2011. The results for the year 2001 show that vegetation has very moderate overall index, reaching value 0,500 as a maximal. The maximal NDVI values in year 2011 are 0.49, while in 1988 it was 0.76, which shows the decrease in the biomass values during the past two decades. The satellite-based monitoring of the northern ecosystems is important tool for detection of the environmental changes, which has been demonstrated in this paper.","['sdv', 'sde', 'info']"

"Chemical Pollution of Coastal Waters in the Izmir Bay, Aegean Sea","During last 30 years in Izmir area (Aegean Sea basin), an industrial growth caused serious environmental contamination of both waters and landscapes. Coastal water pollution caused by the increased industrialization, particularly of Izmir Bay, has been detected recently. Urbanization has impressive rates in Turkey, increasing from 18.5% in 1950 until 62% in 2000. Such uncontrolled urban expansion leads to gradual decrease of fertile landscapes and agricultural areas along the Aegean coasts and increases the pollution of waters. The chemical contamination in Izmir bay (mercury originating from Gediz River and inactive mining sites in Karaburun Peninsula) comes to the shelf waters. Consequently, the detected content of mercury in selected plankton organisms exceeds the acceptable standards as a maximal limit in living creatures. As a result, it has been reported that pollution in Izmir’s overall surface water, chemical quality of groundwaters, lakes and rivers has deteriorated. An increase of water contamination caused by the industrial discharge posed a serious threat to environmental conditions in Izmir area. The ecological threats of water pollution has been documented by many reports, manuscripts and articles reviewed in this paper.","['sdv', 'sde', 'phys']"
Linking GIS and Remote Sensing Data to Study Vegetation Patterns,"The paper studies changes in land cover types in tundra landscapes during the past two decades. The study area is located in the Yamal Peninsula, north-central Russia. The main objective of this research is to analyse changes in vegetation distribution and land cover types over the area of Yamal Peninsula. Methodology of the work aims at technical application of the remote sensing and GIS tools for studies and includes georeferencing, creation of color composites, supervised classification. The research data includes Landsat scenes. The research method consists in Landsat image processing (Fig.1), georeferencing via the Google Earth and spatial analysis performed in ILIWIS GIS. The choice of Landsat scenes for land cover mapping is explained by their well-known advantages of application in geosciences and cartography. The final outcomes show changes in the vegetation coverage and land cover classes in Bovanenkovo region of the Yamal Peninsula, which happened during the past two decades. The results are received by comparing and analyzing of two classified maps covering the same geographic region with time span of 23 years: in 1988 and 2011. The changes mostly concern types of land covers and overall increase of shrubland and willows. It can be explained by the complex environmental changes in Arctic regions, which leads to ―greenness‖ processes, or unnatural increase of willows.","['math', 'info', 'sde', 'scco', 'shs']"

Risks of Cryogenic Landslide Hazards and Their Impact on Ecosystems in Cold Environments,"This paper focuses on monitoring of landscapes downgrading in specific conditions of Arctic ecosystems with cold climate conditions (marshes, permafrost, high humidity and moisture). The paper has a special focus on spatiotemporal assessment of land cover types changes in using GIS answering question “what exactly happens with land cover types over time ?” and “how the landscapes located in specific cold moisture conditions are affected by the landslides”. A specific case study of the current work is cryogenic landslides which are typical for cold environments with permafrost distribution. The research region is located in Yamal Peninsula, north Russia. This work analyses environmental consequences caused by the cryogenic landslides in northern landscapes and overall climate changes affecting sensitive Arctic ecosystems. The thaw of permafrost layer leads to the destruction of the ground soil layer and activates cryogenic landslide processes. After disaster, vegetation coverage needs a long time to recover, due to the sensitivity of the specific northern environment. As a result, land cover types change significantly within the landscapes of the regions affected by the disaster. The application of GIS software was used to analyze and process two satellite images (Landsat TM) taken at different time (1988 and 2011) in order to assess spatiotemporal changes in the land cover types of the Arctic landscapes. This work demonstrates how GIS spatial analysis can be applied to studies of the environmental disasters, as well as monitoring and mapping changes in the landscapes patterns caused by the external factors such as landslide hazards.",['phys']

Why Should We Stand for Geothermal Energy ? Example of the Negative Impacts of Oil and Gas Exploration Activities over the Marine Environment,"Geothermal energy is a clean, environmentally friednly, renewable resource that provides energy around the world. Heat flowing constantly from the interior of the Earth ensure to be an inexhaustible supply of energy. However, existing traditional sources of energy, such as oil and gas are still popular nowadays. Current paper gives a remarkable example of how eco - non friendly and environmentally dangerous these sources of energy are. The given example of oil and gas operations within the Timan-Pechora basin in the shelf and the coast of the Pechora Sea causes contamination of waters by phenol and its accumulation in the bottom sediments and life tissues of the marine habitants. At the same time, the ecosystems of the south-eastern part of the Barents sea, the Pechora Sea, are characterized by their high biodiversity and high level of primary production. The last one is the fundamental biological characteristics for the marine ecosystems meaning the formation of the organic substance in the water by the chlorophyll-contains organisms - phytoplankton. The primary production plays an exceptional role in the functionality of the marine ecosystem's components as the level of primary production is a basic element in the ecological food-chain hierarchy and therefore, the ecosystem with damaged phytoplankton operation and low level of primary production dooms to die. Therefore, the broad objective of the study was to identify location of main carbon deposits as sources of phenol contaminations accordingly to the nature features of the Pechora Sea ecosystem and to compare them with the distribution of the areas with high biological productivity and higher level of the primary production within the Pechora Sea. The results of the research demonstrate that both are located in the south-eastern part of the Pechora Sea. Thus, the major deposits of oil in Pechora Sea and amongst the Prirazlomnoe oil-field with large reserves of hydrocarbons are situated exactly in the eastern part of the Pechora Sea, some of them are located in immediate proximity to the coast. At the same time, shelf zone of the Pechora Sea is distinguished for its high level of the primary production, high bioproductivity and uniqueness of its natural resources, extremely hardly renewable under the conditions of the polar environment. This paper details question of the ecological interrelation of the natural ecosystems and man's activities in this region, where any negative industrial human impacts can have an un-compensable consequences for the unique environment of this little sea.

The Yamal Peninsula is the world's largest high-latitude wetland system covering in total 900,000 km² of peatlands, since lowland region creates ideal conditions for the development of wetlands, dense lake and river network (Kremenetski et al. 2003). The geomorphology of Yamal Peninsula is flat homogeneous land and low-lying plains with maximal elevations lower than 90 meters (Walker et al. 2009). Such environmental settings of Yamal facilitate seasonal flooding, active erosion processing, permafrost distribution and intensive local landslides formation.The dominating vegetation types on Yamal include different types of shrubs and willows, heath, grasses, moss, and lichens. Changes in land cover types in the Russian North are caused by various reasons. These include multiple ecological and social factors, such as permafrost degradation, reindeer grazing and gas-field development, as well as overall environmental changes, including climate (Walker et al. 2009). One of the factors causing changes in vegetation types in landslide formation. Thus, the early-stage vegetation, such as pioneering mosses or lichens usually follows recent landslide formation, while meadows and willow shrubs with high canopy points indicate later stages of vegetation regeneration after landslide activities. Therefore, distribution of the willow shrubs on bare slopes may indicate that these areas were landslide-affected in the past (Ukraintseva and Leibman, 2007; Leibman and Kizyakov, 2007). Current research focuses on application of remote sensing data and GIS methods for land cover change detection in Bovanenkovo region. Technically, the data processing was performed in ILWIS GIS, using methods of image interpretation and supervised classification applied for Landsat TM scenes (1988 and 2011). The classification results indicate changes in land cover types in Yamal ecosystems, namely, the overall increase in woody plants, such as willows and shrub tundra (e.g. ""short shrub tundra"", ""sparse short shrub tundra"" and ""dry short shrub tundra""), and slight decrease in grasses, heath and peatland. The main detected trend in these changes demonstrates process of greening in Arctic tundra, which indicates structural variations in ecosystems within the Bovanenkovo district. These changes can be explained by the complex ecological processes as well as anthropogenic influence, caused by Bovanenkovo gas field exploration and its consequences. Methods The research methods consist of the application of the remote sensing and geoinformation tools for land cover studies. The technical implementation of the imagery processing, spatial analysis and GIS mapping was performed in ILWIS GIS. The research data include two Landsat TM scenes for the years 1988 and 2011. The Landsat data were selected due to their suitability for land cover mapping they enable recurrent remote sensing observations, interpretation and assessment of temporal changes in land cover types in the high north. The research methodology includes supervised classification of the Landsat scenes, GIS mapping highlighting changes in land cover types. And calculation of the areas of various land cover types in 1988 and in 2011. The pre-processing of the imagery includes data import and visual settings of colours and contrast. The images were imported to ILWIS from .img into ILWIS raster map format (ASCII) using GDAL and processed. Final maps are displayed showing land cover changes in 1988-2011.","['info', 'math', 'phys']"
"Water Supply and Usage in Central Asia, Tian Shan BasinСНАБДЕВАЊЕ ВОДОМ И УПОТРЕБА У СРЕДЊОЈ АЗИЈИ, ТИАН ШАН БАСЕН","The paper focuses on analysis of Central Asian hydro-energetic system and water usage in Tian Shan region. Tian Shan system is important water resource in Central Asia: mountains river waters are intensely taken for hydropower energy, urban systems, irrigation. But geopolitics in Tian Shan is difficult: it crosses five densely populated countries. Current problem consists in water delivery between territories located in the highlands with excellent water supply and those located in valleys with water shortage. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan control river basins, and Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan depend on water supply. The problem of water use causes debates among these countries. Besides, climate warming affects glaciers and causes water deficit. Altogether, this leads to difficulties in hydro-energetics. A multidisciplinary analysis was performed in research: geopolitical problems of water supply in Tian Shan, spatial distribution of hydro-energetic resources and climate impact on hydro-energetics.Резиме: Рад се заснива на анализи Централно-азијског енергетског система и искоришћења воде у региону Tian Shan. Tian Shan је важан извор воде у Централној Азији: воде планинских река се интензивно користе за добијање хидроенергије, урбане системе и наводњавање и тако даље. Али, геополитика у Tian Shan је сложена: ту се сусреће пет густо насељених држава. Тренутни проблем је у достави воде између територија које се налазе у планинским крајевима са одличном снабдевеношћу водом и оних које се налазе у долинама са мањком воде. Tajikistan и Kyrgyzstan контролишу речне басене, док Kazakhstan и Uzbekistan зависе од водоснабдевања. Проблем снабдевања водом узрокује дебате између ових држава. Поред тога, глобално загревање утиче на глечере и узрокује дефицит воде. Све у свему, ово доводи до потешкоћа и водоснабдевању и њеном коришћењу.

Object Based Image Analysis for Urban Mapping and City Planning in Belgium,"The 'Object Based Image Analysis' approach (further, OBIA) becomes increasingly popular and is being used for classifying VHR remote sensing images. The use of this innovative approach for urban mapping is highly effective as it makes possible to include information about features, shapes and other characteristics of urban space and to interpret them for the studies of land cover types. Using very high resolution (VHR) image for mapping enables to identify land cover and land use types within urban environment. Hence, the OBIA approach for processing remote sensing data creates effective tools for urban studies. Furthermore, the application of the priori knowledge is necessary for the case studies where additional knowledge can implement detailed information into the existing databases, e.g. information on land cover and land use types, roads, buildings, vegetation units (parks), etc. Particularly useful becomes a priori knowledge for incomplete or outdated databases (containing e.g. missing areas, or those inside of closed blocks, etc). Additional knowledge about the city structures and urban features should be included while interpreting image. The case study of the current research is focused on the eastern part of Brussels, Belgium. The very high resolution image was processed using eCognition software for detecting typical urban objects (e.g. buildings and houses, trees, roads and streets etc). The methodology is detailed below.",['info']
Experimental simulation of spallation elements production in a 9Cr-1Mo martensitic steel 3D atom probe characterisation,"The irradiation damage in the target window of a demonstrator of an Accelerator Driven System (ADS) consists of atomic displacements (dpa) and spallation element production that will affect the in-service properties of the structural material of the target. The atomic displacements (about 100 dpa/year) will promote the formation of point defect clusters, dislocation loops and the precipitation of various phases that contribute to hardening and embrittlement of the structural material. As an example, the Ca and Ti production should harden the material via precipitation, in parallel to embrittlement due to P and S segregation. The purpose of this work was to simulate the spallation element loading, via ion implantation (using the IRMA implanter at CSNSM) and to study at the atomic scale, with the 3D atom probe, their evolution in the 9Cr-1Mo reference martensitic steel. In order to realize this, specific experiments, performed at 300°C, were carried out using low energy ions (Ca, Ti or S) implanted in the extremely small atom probe specimens (needles of 100 nanometers thickness).",['phys']
Atom probe contribution to the caracterisation of CIGSe grain boundaries,"Atom Probe Tomography (APT) technique is the only nano-scale-sensitive analytic tool allowing 3D chemical analysis with atomic scale resolution. For long restricted to conductive samples, implementation of ultra fast laser pulsing extend now the field of applications to the analysis of semiconductor materials. In the present study, high efficiency Cu(In, Ga)Se 2 (CIGSe) thin films have been investigated by APT in order to solve interrogations about grain boundaries (GBs) composition. The analyzed CIGSe layers have been grown by co-evaporation on Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrates following the standard 3-stage process and the atom probe tips prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB) equipment. In order to ensure the presence of GB in the small APT investigated volume, location and misorientation of GBs have been determined by electron backscattering scanning diffraction (EBSD) and one GB interface placed close to the edge of the tip. From APT analyses, spatial distribution of CIGSe elements can be imaged at atomic scale; particular attention has been devoted to the composition profiles at the vicinity of the CIGSe GB interface. New results are compared with usual CIGSe GB passivation models. © 2011 IEEE.",['phys']
Clash of Minds: A BCI Car Racing Game in Simulated Virtual Reality Environment,"Introduction: In this work, we have designed and developed a BCI racing car game in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment using Unity software. The 3D virtual environment consists of two racing cars, tracks, as well as surrounding terrain that includes trees, grass, buildings, mountains, and the sky. Three cameras have been set up to show a driver's view, a bird's-eye view, and a following camera's view. Kinetic parameters of the cars are chosen to simulate physical movements of the car. The two racing cars are separately controlled by two individual drivers' brainwaves. Each driver's EEG brainwaves are monitored in real time using a g.tec Nautilus 32-channels system through Matlab and Simulink. The collected brainwave signals are analyzed online in Matlab using pre-trained machine learning algorithms to decode the intended kinematics. The machine learning algorithms have been trained to classify the driver's instantaneous intention into s categories: moving forward, moving backward, turning left, turning right, and maintaining rest. A control signal is then calculated based on the decoded kinematics and sent through the TCP/IP protocol to Unity to steer the car. Materials and Methods: We implement a hybrid decoding algorithm that combines steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and imagined-body kinematics (IBK) paradigms. SSVEP can provide relatively high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and information transfer rate (ITR) [1] while IBK provides natural imaginary body movement [3]. A two-phase training protocol was designed to train a subject to learn to use the BCI. Signals collected during Phase 1 training are used to train the SSVEP paradigm. Canonical correlation analysis [2] is used to calculate the canonical correlation of the projected EEG and the target frequencies (7.5, 10, 12, and 15Hz) in real-time. In phase two, we train a cross-validated multiple linear regression model for decoding EEG data during IBK paradigms conditioned with two classes of resting and pushing. The overall decoding algorithm is a combination of the SSVEP and the IBK paradigms. We utilize the IBK paradigm as a gating function. If the online model detects the ""pushing"" state, the subject's intended direction by the SSVEP paradigm is translated into the virtual car movement. If the IBK model detects ""resting"" state, the virtual car remains stationary. Results: The platform including GUI interface, Unity 3D environment, training protocol, data acquisition processes, communication protocols, as well as online and offline decoding algorithms, has been fully implemented. The platform has been thoroughly tested to ensure it runs as expected. The current work is focused on recruiting subjects to improve accuracy and robustness of the decoding algorithms. Conclusions: Conventional BCI-based biofeedback systems often fail at maintaining a user's engagement and motivation which makes it difficult to attain a satisfactory level of control. The proposed platform is designed to improve users' experience of motor imagery with a visual feedback of the users' intention on to a virtual car. It serves as a pilot for online BCI-based gaming as well as an educational tool to promote interests in BCI for the public. The setup has potential to use as a research tool for investigators in developmental psychology and behavioral science. Moreover, the developed platform opens the opportunity for us to evaluate users' immersion in virtual reality (VR) using the proposed platform in future study. The platform may suggest an effective visual feedback of vision, which can lay a foundation for BCI application.

"Rural Sustainability and Management of Natural Resources in Tian Shan Region, Central Asia","The research examines aspects of natural and cultural heritage and environmental management in Tian Shan region, Central Asia. This region is outstanding for the richness of natural resources, landscapes and ecosystems. Natural resources of Tian Shan are exceptional: the ecosystems include numerous protected and rare species, endemics, unique coniferous forests, rich biodiversity. However, nowadays the ecosystems experience environmental and anthropogenic impacts. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union (1990s), there is a clear shift of the Central Asian society back to the subsistence agriculture with recovered traditional style of life: private land use and cattle grazing on mountain pastures. Therefore, the anthropogenic impacts are presented by the livestock husbandry and nomadic pastures, since the majority of the local population now maintain traditional style of life. The livestock is increased, and strong grazing pressure become transform to overgrazing. This leads to unsustainable agriculture and overgrazing caused by cattle herds, and affects sustainability in mountainous landscapes. Given the unique ecology of the region, special measures should be taken to maintain ecosystems’ sustainability. The sustainable management of natural resources in this unique region needs stimulating balanced co-existence of man and nature, and requires quality insights and acquaintanceship. Nevertheless, the information about Tian Shan environment is the least available comparing to other Eurasian mountains, and there is lack of regular environmental monitoring programmes cooperated at the cross-country level. This research contributes to regional monitoring of Tian Shan, providing analysis of its environmental situation and examining ways for the sustainable use of natural resources","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"
Geo-Information Technologies of Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) for Urban Mapping,"Current work is aimed at the deriving of information from the remote sensed VHR data using a priori knowledge in the Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach. OBIA technology is new and effective tool for urban mapping, as it enables dealing with raster images for detailed and precise cartography. Specific focus of this study is selected urban areas of the city of Brussels, Belgium. The study is performed using panchromatic very high resolution (VHR) image processed in the eCognition software. The operation “Multi-resolution Segmentation” was chosen for image processing, as this is one of the most important image processing tools. During segmentation the image was divided up into large homogeneous regions and isolated shapes into the separate polygons within the study area. This procedure was performed at a different scale factors to adjust local conditions, such as urban structures, contrast factors, topology, etc. The four first layers in the layers legend represent multispectral image, while the fifth layer belongs to the panchromatic image. These two images were processed, in order to benefit from the high spatial and spectral resolution of the images which have different properties. Besides, processing of both of them gave various results: the panchromatic VHR image enabled to achieve very detailed segmentation of the image. The nearest neighbour classifies subdivide image into objects based on the image sample using mean spectral signature values of the objects. The results are presented by accurate geographic classification of the raster image. The objects are grouped into the separated classes connected with each other according to the hierarchical values of their features. The target objects are detected using existing knowledge which helped to find out what information exists in the objects based on training test areas. The classification is done using nearest neighbour principle after the manual defining of the number of sample objects. The method of the multiresolution segmentation procedure using OBIA approach was applied to the image in eCognition software and the image was processed. The classification is based on the segmentation of the whole image into meaningful polygons, according to the fuzzy logic approach and nearest neighbour classifier which is similar to the supervised classification in usual image analysis software. The work proved effectiveness of the object based image analysis approach for satellite data processing in urban mapping.","['scco', 'info', 'phys', 'shs']"

Current development of tourism and recreation on Baltic Sea coasts: new directions and perspectives,"Research work analyzes current situation and development of tourism in the region of Baltic Sea. Specific case study of this paper is Pärnu Bay, Estonia. This region is known for unique environmental settings: mild maritime climate, broad beaches, coniferous pine forests on the coastal zone and high esthetic value of the surrounding landscapes. However, after the end of USSR, Estonia survived a difficult period of restructuring of economic and social system. This affected touristic cluster, rapidly developing in new directions. Soviet touristic areas became abandoned and reconstructed , new hotels are being actively created, intensive privatization of recreation houses is actively ongoing. Main problem in the touristic cluster in Estonia consists in its specific location on the Baltic Sea with cold climate in summer period. It causes low popularity among tourists, comparing to Mediterranean. Another problem consists in ongoing development of the country, reflected in low investments into tourism, comparing to other European countries. Therefore, the main perspective for the tourism development in Estonia includes active redirection towards eco-style sustainable tourism: camping, biking, sea side recreation, construction of summer cottages for vacations, organized tours to Natural Parks. This paper, supported by fieldwork, has analytical character reviewing current Estonian tourism dynamics. Sociopolitical effects on current tourism directions are discussed, while modern touristic system in Estonia compared to Soviet. The overview of the recreation resort places was performed in Häädemeeste municipality, Pärnu district, and resulted in series of thematic author photos.

It has been proved that in the Wallachian dialect of Bregovo and in the official Romanian language the model is identical – the final Turkish vowel “e” is replaced by “a”, following a soft consonant (in the Romanian language it is marked by the grapheme “ea”). The presence of this group of nouns in the Romanian language and in the Wallachian dialect of Bregovo is evidence of the existence of soft consonants in the two linguistic formations – official and dialect.

Ils subissent cependant des pressions accrues en raison du changement climatique et de l'augmentation de la population humaine, de ses besoins et de leurs répercussions. Ces pressions accrues rendent dans la plupart des cas les pratiques de gestion et les politiques publiques actuelles inadéquates, celles-ci ne parvenant alors plus à atténuer ou réguler de telles pressions et à maintenir le niveau de bénéfices fournis par les écosystèmes. Des approches intégrées centrées sur les écosystèmes peuvent aider à identifier les bénéfices divers fournis par ces écosystèmes, les synergies ou les conflits. Cette identification dépend du niveau d'utilisation ou de conservation des écosystèmes. L'approche par les services écosystémiques peut aider à structurer la production d'évaluations exhaustives s'appuyant sur des connaissances scientifiques et les expériences des gestionnaires. Un processus itératif de « triage » peut être utilisé pour structurer l'interaction et le dialogue entre les acteurs et les scientifiques afin d'établir des études qui soient faisables, utiles et pertinentes en lien avec les questions, les besoins et les projets des gestionnaires et décideurs publics. L'approche par les services écosystémiques permet d'établir une photographie à un temps donné des écosystèmes et activités humaines qui en dépendent. Elle doit être appliquée à intervalles réguliers afin de pouvoir appréhender l'évolution des différents bénéfices fournis par les écosystèmes. L'approche par les services écosystémiques peut être combinée avec le cadre DPSIR (facteurs, pressions, états, impacts, réponses) afin de permettre une identification des facteurs de changement dans les écosystèmes. La combinaison de ces deux approches peut venir enrichir les discussions visant à l'établissement de plans de gestion et de politiques publiques pour la conservation du milieu marin, notamment lorsque ces écosystèmes sont soumis à des pressions liées au changement climatique, et maintenir des écosystèmes productifs et en bonne santé, contribuant au bien-être humain.","['sde', 'shs']"
Informing climate investment priorities for Coastal Populations,"Since the 1990s, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has used global level analyses of vulnerability to inform investment and action against the effects of climate change. Beyond the IPCC, the practice has been used widely to understand the vulnerability of coastal areas to a variety of hazards, including climate change. These analyses, however, have been driven by objectives that change from one assessment to the next, with very different conceptualisations of vulnerability. Over time these analyses have become increasingly data intensive and complex, drawing from an ever-expanding number of indicators. Such variations in objectives, conceptualisations and data have led to different and often contradictory rankings of priority areas for climate change action. The increased complexity makes it more difficult to disentangle the root causes of these different rankings and the degree to which climate change influences vulnerability rankings, compared to other factors such as local environment factors and the adaptive capacity of populations to deal with environmental change. If these global indicator analyses were deconstructed, climate decision-makers could use them as scoping studies rather than expect them to provide comprehensive and robust priorities for investment. Such scoping studies, if they are to be truly useful to climate decision-makers, need to be simplified and harmonised to isolate climate change specific drivers. They can help target the locations for more in-depth local level analyses and should be supplemented by global level analyses of costs of climate action including technical, social and economic factors.","['sde', 'shs']"
Ecosystem services and marine conservation,"Marine and land ecosystems provide many benefits to society. Marine ecosystems are under increased pressure because of climate change, expanding human populations and needs. Increased pressures and associated impacts on ecosystems often render current management and conservation policies inappropriate to mitigate or regulate such pressures and maintain the level of ecosystem benefits provided. Integrated approaches centred on ecosystems can help assess synergies and trade offs for delivery of benefits provided by ecosystems for management options with different levels of usage and conservation. The ecosystem service framework can help structure the production of comprehensive assessments drawing from multi-disciplinary academic knowledge and management experience. Interaction and dialogue with stakeholders structured by a step-wise iterative ‘triage’ process can help ensure ecosystem assessment outputs are meaningful, salient (reflecting the interests of those involved), useful to management and policy concerns, needs and projects, and feasible under available knowledge and resources. The ecosystem service framework needs to be applied at regular intervals to gain an idea of how the benefits derived from ecosystems evolve in time. Using the ecosystem service framework in combination with the DPSIR framework to identify Drivers, Pressures, States, Impact, Response can provide very rich insights to discussions for establishment of management plans and policies for marine conservation, especially those aiming to mitigate or adapt to climate change pressure, for delivery of healthy ecosystems and associated human well-being.","['sde', 'shs']"

"THE INFLATIONARY AND DEFLATIONARY TRENDS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OR 'THE JAPANESE DISEASE' IS SPREADING","The danger of deflation has been rather frequently mentioned recently among numerous concerns over the European and partly American economies.

Similarly, notwithstanding many trillions of dollars, euro, pounds and yen that were invested in economies over the past few years, the inflation in the Western countries still remains low. On the whole, there are reasons to maintain that European countries suffer from ‘the Japanese disease’, and this disease can progress or even become chronic. The USA, although to a lesser extent, has the signs of the disease as well. As a result, the financial infusions can become permanent, as it happened in Japan.

"Global Population Ageing, the Sixth Kondratieff Wave, and the Global Financial System","Concerns about population ageing apply to both developed and many developing countries and it has turned into a global issue. In the forthcoming decades the population ageing is likely to become one of the most important processes determining the future society characteristics and the direction of technological development. The present paper analyzes some aspects of the population age-ing and its important consequences for particular societies and the whole world. Basing on this analysis, we can draw a conclusion that the future technological breakthrough is likely to take place in the 2030s (which we define as the final phase of the Cybernetic Revolution). In the 2020s – 2030s we will expect the upswing of the forthcoming sixth Kondratieff wave, which will introduce the sixth technological paradigm (system). All those revolutionary technological changes will be connected, first of all, with breakthroughs in medicine and related technologies. We also present our ideas about the financial instruments that can help to solve the problem of pension provision for an increasing elderly population in the developed countries. We think that a more purposeful use of pension funds' assets together with an allocation (with necessary guarantees) of the latter into education and upgrading skills of young people in developing countries, perhaps, can partially solve the indicated problem in the developed states.",['shs']

The contributions to this yearbook present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of global historical, political, economic and demographic processes, as well as their mathematical models. This issue of the yearbook consists of three main sections: (I) Long-Term Trends in Nature and Society; (II) Cyclical Processes in Pre-industrial Societies; (III) Contemporary History and Processes. We hope that this issue of the yearbook will be interesting and useful both for historians and mathematicians, as well as for all those dealing with various social and natural sciences.",['shs']
Modeling of Biological and Social Phases of Big History,"In the first part of this article we survey general similarities and differences between biological and social macroevolution. In the second (and main) part, we consider a concrete mathematical model capable of describing important features of both biological and social macroevolution. In mathematical models of historical macrodynamics, a hyperbolic pattern of world population growth arises from non-linear, second-order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. Based on diverse paleontological data and an analogy with macrosociological models, we suggest that the hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by non-linear, second-order positive feedback between diversity growth and the complexity of community structure. We discuss how such positive feedback mechanisms can be modelled mathematically",['shs']
Global History and Future World Order,"The present article analyzes the world order in the past, present and future as well as the main factors, foundations and ideas underlying the maintaining and change of the international and global order. The first two sections investigate the evolution of the world order starting from the ancient times up to the late twentieth century. The third section analyzes the origin and decline of the world order based on the American hegemony. The authors reveal the contradictions of the current uni-polar world and explain in what way globalization has become more profitable for the developing countries but not for the developed ones. The authors also explain the strengthening belief that the US leading status will inevitably weaken. In this connection we discuss the alternatives of the American strategy and the possibility of the renaissance of the American leadership. The last section presents a factor analysis which allows stating that the world is shifting toward a new balance of power and is likely to become the world without a leader. The new world order will consist of a number of large blocks, coalitions and countries acting within a framework of rules and mutual responsibility. However, the transition to a new world order will take certain time (about two decades). This period, which we denote as the epoch of new coalitions, will involve a reconfiguration of the World System and bring an increasing turbulence and conflict intensity.",['shs']
Cyclical Dynamics in Economics and Politics in the Past and in the Future,"Nikolay Kondratieff is known primarily for his theory of long cycles. However, it is worth recalling that he was among the first who started to investigate the nature of different economic cycles and their systematic interaction. Actually the primary classification of cycles into short, medium and long belongs to Kondratieff. In 1922, in his book The World Economy and its Conjunctures during and after the War Nikolay Kondratieff formulated for the first time the basic tenets of the theory of long cycles (Kondratieff 1922 [2002]). As until that time the economic literature hardly knew any other cycles than the ones with a characteristic period between 7 and 11 years (which were called industrial, commercial, and so on), Kondratieff quite logically called them ‘short cycles’ (Ibid.: 323). However, already in 1925, in the Long Cycles of Conjuncture (Kondratieff 1925 [1993]: 25–26), he began to call the same cycles as ‘medium cycles’. 1 Why? The fact is that in those years Kitchin (1923) discovered some cycles (with a characteristic period between 3 and 4 years) manifested in fluctuations in inventories that could be denoted as truly ‘short cycles’. Later, they became known as ‘Kitchin cycles’. Due to the fact that the medium-term cycles often have internal ups and downs, a group of scientists in the Harvard School headed by Wesley Mitchell started to consider cycles statistically (not by their logic, but by the presence of recessions, from a recession to another recession, regardless of the point that different recessions may be significantly different as regards their strength and nature). As a result, they also detected some cycles with a period between 3 and 4 years (which to a certain extent coincided with Kitchin cycles).",['shs']
WHICH GLOBAL TRANSFORMATIONS WOULD THE GLOBAL CRISIS LEAD TO?,This article analyzes the global causes of the contemporary crisis and the possibilities to eliminate the most acute problems that have generated this crisis. It analyzes both the negative role of the world financial flows and their important positive functions including the ‘insurance’ of social guaranties at the global scale. In connection with the outcome of the crisis it analyzes the conditions of possible transformations of the world system and the possibility of various global scripts of its near future. It gives a characteristic of the coming ‘epoch of new coalitions’; it gives some futuristic prognosis,['shs']
"Global Population Ageing, the Sixth Kondratieff Wave, and the Global Financial System","The present paper analyzes some aspects of the population ageing and its important consequences for particular societies and the whole world. Basing on this analysis, we can draw a conclusion that the future technological breakthrough is likely to take place in the 2030s (which we define as the final phase of the Cyber-netic Revolution). In the 2020s – 2030s we will expect the upswing of the forthcoming sixth Kondratieff wave, which will introduce the sixth technological paradigm (system). All those revolutionary technological changes will be connected, first of all, with breakthroughs in medicine and related technologies. We also present our ideas about the financial instruments that can help to solve the problem of pension provision for an increasing elderly population in the developed countries. We think that a more purposeful use of pension funds' assets together with an allocation (with necessary guarantees) of the latter into education and upgrading skills of young people in developing countries, perhaps, can partially solve the indicated problem in the developed states.",['shs']
Interaction between Kondratieff Waves and Juglar Cycles,"Some important correlations between medium-term economic cycles (7– 11 years) known as Juglar cycles and long (40–60 years) Kondratieff cycles are presented in this paper. The research into the history of this issue shows that this aspect is insufficiently studied. Meanwhile, in our opinion, it can significantly clarify both the reasons of alternation of upswing and downswing phases in K-waves and the reasons of relative stability of the length of these waves. It also can provide the certain means for forecasting. The authors show that adjacent 2–4 medium cycles form the system the important characteristic of which is the dynamics of economic trend. The latter can be upswing (active) or downswing (depressive). The mechanisms of formation of such medium-term trends and changing tendencies are explained. The presence of such clusters of medium cycles (general duration of which is 20–30 years) determines to a large degree the long-wave dynamics and the characteristics of its timing. Thus, not medium-term J-cycles depend on the character of K-wave phase as Kondratieff supposed, but the character of the cluster of J-cycles determines significantly the character of K-wave phases.",['shs']
"Global Population Ageing, the Sixth Kondratieff Wave, and the Global Financial System","The concerns about population ageing apply to both developed and many developing countries and it has turned into a global issue. In the forthcoming decades the population ageing is likely to become one of the most important processes determining the future society characteristics and the direction of technological development. The present paper analyzes some aspects of the population ageing and its important consequences for particular societies and the whole world. Basing on this analysis, we can draw a conclusion that the future technological breakthrough is likely to take place in the 2030s (which we define as the final phase of the Cybernetic Revolution).

THE PROCESSES OF SYSTEMIC INTEGRATION IN THE WORLD SYSTEM,"The paper discusses some aspects of integration of different regions and societies in the course of historical globalization. Within historical globalization one can observe a close correlation between such important processes as technological transformations, urbanization, political integration, struggle for political hegemony, etc. In the paper we analyze these correlations to associate historical globalization with phases of expansion. Within the expansion process we point out seven levels from the local level through the planetary one. The most significant changes were associated with crucial technological breakthroughs, or production revolutions, and other related transformations like the Urban Revolution. The latter can be regarded as a phase transition of the Afroeurasian world-system to a qualitatively new level of complexity. There are also several periods which one can define as landmarks in the world-system history. The paper also offers some theoretical ideas about cycles of divergence and convergence.",['shs']
GLOBAL TECHNOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES IN THE LIGHT OF CYBERNETIC REVOLUTION AND THEORY OF LONG CYCLES,"In the present paper, on the basis of the theory of production principles and production revolutions, we reveal the interrelation between K-waves and major technological breakthroughs in history and make some predictions about features of the sixth Kondratieff wave in the light of the Cybernetic Revolution which, we think, started in the 1950s. We assume that the sixth K-wave in the 2030s and 2040s will merge with the final phase of the Cybernetic Revolution (which we call the phase of self-regulating systems). This period will be characterized by breakthroughs in medical technologies which will manage to combine many other technologies into a single complex of MBNRIC-technologies (med-bio-nano-robo-info-cognitive technologies). The article offers some predictions concerning the development of these technologies.",['shs']
ORIGINS OF GLOBALIZATION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE AFROEURASIAN WORLD-SYSTEM HISTORY,"The formation of the Afroeurasian world-system was one of the crucial points of social evolution, starting from which the social evolution rate and effectiveness increased dramatically. In the present article we analyze processes and scales of global integration in historical perspective, starting with the Agrarian Revolution. We connect the main phases of historical globalization with the processes of the development of the Afroeurasian world-system. In the framework of the Afroeurasian world-system the integration began a few thousand years BCE. In this world-system the continental and supracontinental links became rather developed long before the Great Geographic Discoveries and thus, they could quite be denoted as global (albeit in a somehow limited sense). As some researchers are still inclined to underestimate the scale of those links in the pre-Industrial era, it appears necessary to provide additional empirical support for our statement. It also turns necessary to apply a special methodology (which necessitated the use of the world-system approach). We analyze some versions of periodization of globalization history. We also propose our own periodization of globalization history using as its basis the growing scale of intersocietal links as an indicator of the level of globalization development.",['shs']
Research into Global Ageing and Its Consequences,"With the further growth of the world population and the further intensification of the processes of interaction between countries and increasing movements of the masses of people, the role of Political Demography becomes more and more important. Issues of global ageing, migration, low fertility in developed countries (or very high fertility in some African countries), high mortality in many developing states (including deaths from AIDS); rapid change in the ethnic composition in Europe and in several other regions and many other pressing issues are in the focus of this discipline. Some of these problems are analyzed in this yearbook. However, among those issues, the issue of global ageing becomes more and more pressing every year. It is sufficient to take into account the point that within two forthcoming decades a rapid global increase in the number of retirement-age persons will lead to its doubling within this fairly small historical period. The concerns about population ageing apply to both developed and many developing countries and it has turned into a global issue. In the next decades the population ageing is likely to become one of the most important processes determining the future society characteristics and directions of technological development.",['shs']
Cosmic Evolution and Universal Evolutionary Principles,"The present article attempts at combining Big History potential with the potential of Evolutionary Studies in order to achieve the following goals: 1) to apply the historical narrative principle to the description of the star-galaxy era of the cosmic phase of Big History; 2) to analyze both the cosmic history and similarities and differences between evolutionary laws, principles, and mechanisms at various levels and phases of Big History. As far as I know, nobody has approached this task in a systemic way yet. It appears especially important to demonstrate that many evolutionary principles, patterns, regularities, and rules, which we tend to find relevant only for higher levels and main lines of evolution, can be also applied to cosmic evolution. Moreover, almost everything that we know about evolution may be detected in the cosmic history, whereas many of the evolutionary characteristics are already manifested here in a rather clear and salient way. Of course, many of the characteristics are manifested in initial or nonsystematic forms but some features, on the contrary, appear to be more distinct just in the cosmic phase. And at the same time when many characteristics and features which are typical of biological and social evolution unexpectedly reveal their roots or protoforms at earlier phases, one becomes aware that the universal character of evolution is real and it can be detected in a number of manifestations. One should also bear in mind that the origin of galaxies, stars, and other celestial objects is the lengthiest evolutionary process among all evolutionary processes in the Universe. Such an approach opens new perspectives for our understanding of evolution and Big History, of their driving forces, vectors, and trends, it also creates a consolidated field for the multidisciplinary re-search.",['shs']
The Star-Galaxy Era of Big History in the Light of Universal Evolutionary Principles,"Big History provides a unique opportunity to consider the development of the Universe as a single process. Within Big History studies one can distinguish some common evolutionary laws and principles. However, it is very important to recognize that there are many more such integrating principles, laws, mechanisms and patterns of evolution at all its levels than it is usually supposed. In the meantime, we can find the common traits in development, functioning, and interaction of apparently rather different processes and phenomena of Big History. Of special importance is the point that many principles, patterns, regularities, and rules of evolution, which we tend to find relevant only for the biological and social levels of evolution, may be also applied to the cosmic phase of evolution. The present article attempts (within such a framework for the first time in the Big History framework) at combining Big History potential with the potential of Evolutionary Studies. It does not only analyze the history of the Cosmos. It studies similarities between evolutionary laws, principles, and mechanisms at various levels and phases of Big History.

Cybernetic Revolution and Forthcoming Technological Transformations (The Development of the Leading Technologies in the Light of the Theory of Production Revolutions),"The article analyzes the technological shifts which took place in the second half of the 20th and early 21st centuries and forecasts the main shifts in the next half a century. On the basis of the analysis of the latest achievements in innovative technological directions and also on the basis of the opportunities provided by the theory of production revolutions the authors present a detailed analysis of the latest production revolution which is denoted as ‘Сybernetic’. The authors give some forecasts about its development in the nearest five decades and up to the end of the 21st century. It is shown that the development of various self-regulating systems will be the main trend of this revolution. The authors argue that at first the transition to the beginning of the final phase of the Cybernetic Revolution will start in the field of medicine (in its some innovative directions). In future we will deal with the start of convergence of innovative technologies which will form the system of MBNRIC-technologies (i.e. the technological paradigm based on medicine, bio- and nanotechnologies, robotics, IT and cognitive technologies). The article gives a detailed analysis of the future breakthroughs in medicine, bio- and nanotechnologies as well as some other technologies in terms of the development of self-regulating systems with their growing ability to select optimum modes of functioning as well as of other characteristics of the Cybernetic Revolution (resources and energy saving, miniaturization, individualization, etc.).",['shs']
Beyond Global Studies. An Introductory Lecture into a Big History Course,"Global studies can be made not only with respect to the humans who inhabit the Earth, they can well be done with respect to biological and abiotic systems of our planet. Such an approach opens wide horizons for the modern university education as it helps to form a global view of various processes. However, we can also ask ourselves whether the limits of our studies can be moved further. Would not it be useful for the students to understand the evolution of our planet within the context of the evolution of our Universe? The need to see this process of development holistically, in its origins and growing complexity, is fundamental to what drives not only science but the human imagination. This shared vision of the grand narrative is one of the most effective ways to conceptualize and integrate our growing knowledge of the Universe, society, and human thought. Note that the respective discipline already exists and it has been developing quite successfully for more than three decades; it is denotes as Big History.",['shs']

"Introduction Modeling and Measuring Cycles, Processes, and Trends","The present Yearbook (which is the fourth in the series) is subtitled Trends & Cycles. Already ancient historians (see, e.g., the second Chapter of Book VI of Polybius' Histories) described rather well the cyclical component of historical dynamics, whereas new interesting analyses of such dynamics also appeared in the Medieval and Early Modern periods (see, e.g., Ibn Khaldūn 1958 [1377], or Machiavelli 1996 [1531]1). This is not surprising as the cyclical dynamics was dominant in the agrarian social systems. With modernization, the trend dynamics became much more pronounced and these are trends to which the students of modern societies pay more attention. Note that the term trend – as regards its contents and application – is tightly connected with a formal mathematical analysis. Trends may be described by various equations – linear, exponential, power-law, etc. On the other hand, the cliodynamic research has demonstrated that the cyclical historical dynamics can be also modeled mathematically in a rather effective way (see, e.g., Usher 1989; Chu and Lee 1994; Turchin 2003, 2005a, 2005b; Turchin and Korotayev 2006; Turchin and Nefedov 2009; Nefedov 2004; Korotayev and Komarova 2004; Korotayev, Malkov, and Khaltourina 2006; Korotayev and Khaltourina 2006; Korotayev 2007; Grinin 2007), whereas the trend and cycle components of historical dynamics turn out to be of equal importance",['shs']

"Introduction. Once More about Aspects, Directions, General Patterns and Principles of Evolutionary Development.","The present volume is the fourth issue of the Almanac series entitled ‘Evolu-tion’. Thus, one can maintain that our Almanac, which has actually turned into a Yearbook, has succeeded (see below). The title of the present volume is ‘From Big Bang to Nanorobots’. In this way we demonstrate that all phases of megaevolution and Big History are cov-ered in the articles of the present Yearbook. Several articles also present fore-casts about possible future developments. The main objective of our Yearbook as well as of the previous issues (see Grinin, Korotayev, Carneiro, and Spier 2011a, Grinin, Korotayev, and Rodrigue 2011a, Grinin and Korotayev 2013a) is the creation of a unified interdis-ciplinary field of research in which scientists specializing in different disciplines could work within a framework of unified or similar paradigms, using common terminology and searching for common rules, tendencies and regularities. At the same time for the formation of such an integrated field one should use all available opportunities: theories, laws and methods. In the present volume, a number of such approaches including those which will be described below are used.",['shs']

Elucidating the constructs happiness and wellbeing: A mixed methods approach,"In this study we examine the constructs ""happiness"" and ""wellbeing"" in a sample of Canadian women and men in mid-adulthood. Through a sequential mixed-methods approach, we utilize Sen and Nussbaum's conceptualizations of capabilities to inform the themes generated from semi-structured interviews. We find that participants understand happiness and wellbeing as two distinct constructs that are illuminated in the metaphors happiness as balance and the gears of wellbeing. Second, we corroborate these constructs through a principal component analysis of questionnaire data. We conclude that happiness and wellbeing are not static entities, but rather iterative processes that are constantly in flux and determined by the fulfillment of the often contradictory needs for (1) goal-achievement and an acceptance of reality, and (2) freedom along with meaning-making, which often involves creating restraints in one's life. These findings have important implications for those using happiness and wellbeing as policy outcome measures.",['shs']
Degenerate second order mean field games systems,"We consider degenerate second order mean field games systems with a local coupling. The starting point is the idea that mean field games systems can be understood as an optimality condition for optimal control of PDEs.

New role of aminothiazo-naphthalimide derivatives: Outstanding photoinitiators for cationic and radical photopolymerizations under visible LEDs,"Aminothiazonaphthalimide derivatives (ATNDs) can act as photoinitiators (when combined with iodonium salt, amine, 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine or N-vinylcarbazole) to start the ring-opening cationic polymerization of epoxides or the radical polymerization of acrylates upon exposure to visible LEDs (405 nm or 455 nm) or a polychromatic visible light delivered by a halogen lamp. The photoinitiating ability of some of these systems is even better than that of the well-known camphorquinone based systems and the commercial bisacylphosphine oxide type I photoinitiator, unambiguously showing their outstanding performance. The structure/reactivity relationships as well as the particular role played by the position of the aminothiazo-substituent in the ATNDs is revealed by mechanistic studies using steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, fluorescence, laser flash photolysis, and electron spin resonance spin trapping techniques",['chim']
In vitro Evaluation of Biofield Treatment on Enterobacter cloacae: Impact on Antimicrobial Susceptibility and Biotype,"This research work investigated the influence of biofield treatment on Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047) against antimicrobial susceptibility. Two sets of ATCC samples were taken in this experiment and denoted as A and B. ATCC A sample was revived and divided into two parts Gr. I (control) and Gr. II (revived); likewise, ATCC B was labeled as Gr. III (lyophilized). Group II and III were given with biofield treatment. The control and treatment groups of E. cloacae cells were tested with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility, biochemical reactions pattern and biotype number. The result showed significant decrease in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of aztreonam and ceftazidime (≤ 8 μg/mL), as compared to control group (≥ 16 μg/mL). It was observed that 9% reaction was altered in the treated groups with respect to control out of the 33 biochemical reactions. Moreover, biotype number of this organism was substantially changed in group II (7731 7376) and group III (7710 3176) on day 10 as compared to control (7710 3376). The result suggested that biofield treatment had an impact on E. cloacae with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility, alteration of biochemical reactions pattern and biotype.",['sdv']

"Seeking Finance, Perceived Financial Constraints and R&D Engagement","This study empirically examines the association among R&D engagement, seeking finance and perceived financial constraints in high-tech SMEs. R&D engagement includes the decision of R&D engagement (whether a firm was engaged in R&D) and the degree of R&D engagement (actual R&D expenditure). I take into account both financial constraints and the former process, seeking finance. This paper proposes two sequential hypotheses. Firstly, I postulate that the decision of R&D engagement has a positive relationship with seeking finance in high-tech SMEs. Next, for those high-tech SMEs that applied for fund, I presume that perceived financial constraints are negatively related with the degree of R&D engagement. The empirical results are consistent with my expectations and thus the hypotheses are supported.","['math', 'shs']"
Mechanism study of Li+ insertion into titania nanotubes,Li+ insertion into anatase titania nanotubes (TiO(2)nts) employing PEO-based polymer electrolyte has been studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The study shows that Li+ storage in the anatase is dominated by the bulk diffusion (into the lattice) and the increasing contribution of the pseudo-capacitive effect with faster kinetics. We also report that the chemical diffusion of Li+ in self-organized TiO(2)nts is around 2 x 10(-16) cm(2) s(-1) suggesting that the use of a solid electrolyte does not alter the charge transport in the nanostructured electrode.,['chim']
"Sterility, fecundity: what about the men?","Human reproduction is based on the sexual union of a man and a woman. Nonetheless, scientific research on fertlity (births), fécundity (the ability to give birth) or contraception (birth control) is mainly devoted to women and practically ignores men. Some studies on male fecundity have been carried out, however. These focus on the role of men in three aspects of human fecundity: couple infertility, the question of a possible male fecundity decrease with age and the hypothesis that the fecundity of younger male generations may be diminishing.","['sdv', 'shs']"
Performance analysis of space-shift keying over negative-exponential and log-normal FSO channels,"The average bit-error rate (ABER) performance of free-space optical (FSO) communication links is investigated for space-shift keying (SSK) over log-normal and negative-exponential atmospheric turbulence channels. SSK is compared with repetition codes and a single-input single-output system using multiple pulse amplitude modulations. Simulation results show that the signal-to-noise ratio gain of SSK largely increases with greater spectral efficiencies and/or higher turbulence effects. A tight bound for ABER is derived based on an exact moment generation function (MGF) for negative-exponential channel and an approximate MGF for log-normal channel. Finally, extensive Monte Carlo simulations are run to validate the analytical analysis.",['spi']
"Physical, Thermal and Spectroscopic Characterization of Biofield Treated p-Chloro-m-cresol","p-Chloro-m-cresol(PCMC) is widely used in pharmaceutical industries as biocide and preservative. However, it faces the problems of solubility in water and photo degradation. The aim of present study was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physical, thermal and spectral properties of PCMC. For this study, PCMC sample was divided into two groups i.e., one served as treated and other as control. The treated group received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment and both control and treated samples of PCMC were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyser, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The XRD result showed a 12.7% increase in crystallite size in treated samples along with increase in peak intensity as compared to control. Moreover, surface area analysis showed a 49.36% increase in surface area of treated PCMC sample as compared to control. The thermal analysis showed significant decrease (25.94%) in the latent heat of fusion in treated sample as compared to control. However, no change was found in other parameters like melting temperature, onset temperature of degradation, and Tmax (temperature at which maximum weight loss occur). The FT-IR spectroscopy did not show any significant change in treated PCMC sample as compared to control. Although, the UV-Vis spectra of treated samples showed characteristic absorption peaks at 206 and 280 nm, the peak at 280 nm was not found in control sample. The control sample showed another absorbance peak at 247 nm. GC-MS data revealed that carbon isotopic ratio (δ13C) was changed up to 204% while δ18O and δ37Cl isotopic ratio were significantly changed up to 142% in treated samples as compared to control. These findings suggest that biofield treatment has significantly altered the physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties, which can affect the solubility and stability of p-chloro-m-cresol and make it more useful as a pharmaceutical ingredient.",['sdv']
Anion-conducting sulfaminated aromatic polymers by acid functionalization,"A simple synthesis technique for the preparation of anionic conducting membranes is presented. In the first step, poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) reacts with chlorosulfonic acid to produce chlorosulfonated PEEK, which in a second step is transformed by reaction with a secondary amine, dimethyl- or diethylamine, into sulfaminated PEEK. The sulfaminated PEEK is cast and the membranes are functionalized in a last step by reaction with various aqueous acid solutions, including HCl, HBr, HNO3, H2SO4, and H3PO4. The spectroscopic, thermal, mechanical, permeability and electrical properties of the membranes are determined and discussed. The combination of appealing properties, such as high elastic modulus (similar to 1300 MPa), high thermal stability, low cation permeability, respectable anionic conductivity (2-4 mS cm(-1)), and a relatively simple and inexpensive synthesis make these new ionomers very promising for applications especially in acidic media, like in vanadium redox flow batteries.",['chim']

The economics of non-GMO segregation,"Cet article, synthèse d'un document de recherche, examine les coûts liés à la ségrégation d'une filière avec OGM (organismes génétiquement modifiés) et d'une filière non OGM à identité préservée aux Etats-Unis. Ces coûts sont étudiés pour les semenciers, les agriculteurs, les organismes stockeurs et les transformateurs. Il semble qu'un coût important de ségrégation provient d'une perte de flexibilité dans l'utilisation des équipements de stockage, collecte, transport et transformation, qui doivent maintenir séparés les produits des deux filières. Malgré ces coûts, l'ajustement de l'infrastructure de collecte, stockage et transformation sera graduel et lent, en raison des coûts fixes élevés. Les auteurs examinent également les coûts pour contrôler la pollinisation croisée dans le cas du maïs et les coûts des tests de détection du contenu OGM. L'importance cruciale des seuils de tolérance (contenu OGM autorisé dans les produits non OGM) pour les coûts de ségrégation est soulignée.",['shs']

Low Complexity K-Best based Iterative Receiver for MIMO Systems,"Iterative receiver combining multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection with channel decoding is an attractive solution to greatly improve the error rate performance of wireless communication systems. However, such iterative process poses significant challenges for efficient receiver design. In this paper, a modification of soft-input soft-output K-Best decoder is proposed to provide high throughput with low complexity. Moreover, the convergence of combining sphere decoder based detection algorithms with LTE turbo decoder is analyzed with the help of EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts. An optimized scheduling of the number of iterations is therefore proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed decoder and the new schedule achieve almost the same performance compared to the conventional schedule with a large saving in computational complexity.",['info']

DISASTER AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE CONTEXT OF VENEZUELA'S OIL CRISIS,"On August 25, 2012, the Amuay oil refinery in northwestern Venezuela suffered an explosion. This unprecedented accident in the national oil industry killed 48 people and injured 156. In this study, we have adopted a political anthropology approach, in which natural and industrial disaster issues are posited as part and parcel of a nation's history. Our purpose is to examine the relation between the oil industry, the changes that took place within the state during the Venezuelan "" Bolivarian revolution , "" (1) collective attitudes towards disaster anticipation, and social representations of uncertainties and insecurity. Our study of the Amuay explosion and blaze is part of an analytical reconstruction of the oil policies of the Chavez (1999-2013) and succeeding Maduro administra-TEPSIS PAPER 06 / APRIL 2015 Laboratory of Excellence TEPSIS, 96 Bd Raspail 75006 Paris, http://tepsis.hypotheses.org 2 tions. After the new majority won the parliamentary elections of December 6, 2015, it set about closely examining the financial statements and condition of facilities of the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). The new representatives questioned the veracity of the company's financial statements and reports. The country's economy came under serious threat and lapsed into crisis, and the growth model championed by the late President Hugo Chavez (1954-2013) collapsed. Granted, the crisis in that model, which relied heavily on oil revenue, was aggravated by the 2014 drop in the price of the barrel, but a revision of economic data shows that the end of the last oil boom (2006-2014) is not the main culprit. The citizens of Venezuela are confronted with highly unusual situations in their daily lives. During our fieldwork in Caracas, Coro and Punto Fijo (about 600 kilometers west of Caracas) in the summer of 2015, we noted the harsh effects of an inflation rate nearing 120 percent and causing increased shortages of basic foodstuffs and medicine.

REENTRY SUPPORT IN COMMUNITY LEGAL ACCESS POINTS: A LAWYER'S PERSPECTIVE,"Imprisonment cuts off inmates from society. The lack of social, family, or professional bonds leaves inmates feeling empty, forgotten and left out. Time behind bars, regardless of its duration, causes disruption. Not only do inmates have their rights temporarily suspended, but they also experience their accelerated loss – in terms of housing, employment, family, or residence on French territory, etc. Life in prison has an inherent "" unsocializing "" effect on inmates in that it structures their lives for them and robs them of a large part of their daily responsibilities. However, sentences are finite, and men and women behind bars eventually return to the community… They must literally re-learn to live and function in society.

From the Mediterranean to the Far North: A Refugees Corridor at the Russian-Norwegian Border,"A pristine area that has largely been preserved from external influences, the Arctic faces dangers coming from climate change and the growing appetite of energy firms—not to mention the challenges associated with a burgeoning tourism industry. The Arctic’s growing connectedness with the rest of the world became apparent in late 2015 and early 2016, when an “Arctic road” suddenly emerged for refugees fleeing the southern Mediterranean basin. In September 2015 the small industrial city of Nikel, Russia, located about 30 km from the Norwegian border and 125 km from the regional capital Murmansk, faced an unprecedented wave of refugees. Two to three months later, at least 5,000 people had passed through the town to apply for refugee status in Norway.

Unstructured Data Integration through Automata-Driven Information Extraction,"Extracting information from plain text and restructuring them into relational databases raise a challenge as how to locate relevant information and update database records accordingly. In this paper, we propose a wrapper to efficiently extract information from unstructured documents, containing plain text expressed with natural-like language. Our extraction approach is based on the automata formalism to describe the wrapping process running from text documents to Databases. As usual, relevant information in the text document are delimited by regular expressions, which define the extracting automaton. Each automaton is enriched by an output function that automatically generates SQL queries synchronized with the extracting process in order to insert extracted data into database records. We validate our extraction approach with automaton-based prototype to extract legal information about Lebanese official journal decrees and automatically insert them into a relational database.",['info']

A comparative approach for sustainability assessment in historic urban context,"The study of the processes which determine urban sustainability appear to be at the center of the contemporary debate on the future development of the city. This is particularly evident when regarding historic cities. Indeed the city of the future will ideally be smart and sustainable, while keeping intact their heritage and traditional values. But what could be the connection between urban heritage and sustainable development? What tools can be used to promote and assess the sustainability of historic urban landscape? This article reviews, after an international and comparative approach, two different and specific cases: Italy and France. Once explained the operative assessment model of the different countries, attention is drawn to the role of heritage indicators. The last part of the position paper concerns the need expressed by the principal actors of two cities, Turin and Paris, to provide both of the different realities with a diagnostic tool that contains dimensions of both heritage and sustainability, that will be the base for future urban decisions and a fundamental support for decision-makers.","['sde', 'shs']"
Fast Optical methods for real-time monitoring of pulsed laser processing of thin films,"Thin film materials have been attracted many new and promising applications in numerous technology fields from microelectronics to biosensors. Laser processing of those films is still explored to achieve targeted properties as optical and electrical, thermal or mechanical high properties. Fast optical methods were developed during the last decade for the monitoring of the real-time or the time-resolved processing by nano and sub-nanosecond pulsed lasers. More particularly pulsed photothermal (PPT) and real time reflectometry (RTR) were successfully used for the thermo-physical/ themo-mechanical characterization of numerous thin samples such as Ti embedded vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) carpets and/or mesoporous silicon (MeSi) membranes. Those characterizations were achieved using a homemade optical device based on picosecond time-detection in hemi-spherical vacuum chamber. Contribution of real-time RTR to laser induced processes is highlighted through several applications with Excimer and Nd:YAG laser beams processing a high number of materials (sc-Si, sc-ZnO, Fe-C…) related either to sensor fabrication or optical surface properties enhancement. In addition to the surface temperature monitoring, the PPT technique, with less than 2ns response time, allows the evaluation of thermal properties of a wide range of promising thin film materials used for the thermal management of microelectronic power devices. As reducing the size of active surfaces, laser-based nanostructuration of copper and titanium thin films as well as Me-Si substrates was also successfully monitored using RTR from nano to the picosecond scale. A comparative study of the incubation coefficient determined using the ‘Liu’ semi-empirical approach to the one determined by the RTR method would be also detailed","['spi', 'phys']"

In this way thermo-physical properties of AlN, CNT and MeSi films will be discussed leading to predict the best materials fabrication process for a targeted application. As reducing the size of active surfaces, laser-based nanostructuration of copper thin films as well as MeSi was also successfully monitored using RTR at the picosecond scale. This last topic is also illustrated in correlation to thin films thermo-electric properties evaluation, particularly in the case of oxides and polymers films.

Data conversion from ASCII text data format to raster using ArcToolbox / Conversion Tools / ASCII to Raster (Climate precipitation data). Data were projected, processed and several layer formatting and overlays were created. Mapping was created using ArcMap. Victoria Lake has unique environment, important role in the economy of countries supporting 25 M people through fish catchment reaching up to 90-270$ per capita per annum. Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda control 6%, 49% and 45% of the lake surface. Lake catchment provides livelihood of 1/3 of the population of 3 countries with agricultural economy supported by fishing and agriculture (tea and coffee plantations). Quality of the environment is a fundamental factor in maintaining and increasing living standards of the population. Main problem is sustainable development, well-balanced between using natural resources and human economic progress. Essential factors in this problem are population and natural resources management. Following research tasks are performed: Computing how much cropland is needed by 2030. Areas of cropland were estimated using statistics of the raster layer Land cover. Amount of crop per capita was computed by dividing total cropland in each country and total population. Estimation of cropland needed in 2030: multiplying crop per capita needed for the total population by 2030. How much forest can be converted to cropland from protected areas ? Clipped vector layer of the protected areas was converted to raster using Spatial Analyst / Vector to Raster. New raster was re-classified to one class. Land cover raster layer was multiplied to the Protected areas layer. After calculation, raster of Land Cover for the territory of protected area zones was received. Areas for each country were calculated. Outside and inside located areas were estimated by subtraction those areas from the total for each country: Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Results: computed areas of cropland needed in 2030: Kenya – 248,778 km2. Tanzania – 991,469km2; Uganda - 153,992 km2. Percentage converted to cropland in 2030 (from the total forest area): Kenya – 370%; Tanzania – 148%; Uganda - 618%.

"Rural Sustainability and Management of Natural Resources in Tian Shan Region, Central Asia","Current presentation introduces an analysis of the land use and current environmental situation of the Tian Shan region. Tian Shan (the ’Celestial Mountains’) is the largest high mountain systems (800,000 km2) in the World. geopolitically, Tian Shan is located in the heart of Central Asia. It crosses five densely populated countries: China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Tian Shan regions has unique ecosystems, Shrenk mountain forests and endemic species. Tian Shan is composed by large, isolated mountains, surrounded by the Tarim desert basin of north-western China, Lake Issyk Kul and deserts of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Tian Shan region is outstanding for the richness of natural resources, landscapes and ecosystems. Rare species: ca 70\% of species (both animal and plants) have specific south Asian distribution, typical for steppe and desert ecosystems. The ecosystems include numerous protected and rare species (over 4000 wild species), relicts and endemics, unique coniferous forests, rich biodiversity. The slopes of the Tian Shan mountains at altitudes 2000 to 3000m are mostly covered by precious coniferous forests of Schrenk’s Spruce (Picea schrenkiana), recorded in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.

Imperial properties in Roman Hispania: the epigraphical evidence,"The Roman emperors owned several varied properties along the provinces of Iberian Peninsula, among them were: landed states, quarries, slaves and mainly mines. This vast richness was managed by a healthy team of financial procurators, imperial freedmen and slaves. Naturally, these individuals and their activities made a mark in the epigraphical record. However, despite the economic and social importance and the high political role of the properties of Roman emperors, in reality there is not any complete study dedicated to this subject for Hispania, nor throughout Roman Empire. Precisely, the ERC project PATRIMONIVM, in which our research is included and is intended to fill this gap conducting the first comprehensive and multidisciplinary socioeconomic study of the properties of the Roman Emperors from Octavian/Augustus to Diocletian. This project is hosted by the Ausonius Institute at the Bordeaux Montaigne University and it is coordinated by Dr. Alberto Dalla Rosa. In this poster, we offer the main results of the epigraphical survey to be a starting point of this research matter. The final outcome of this epigraphical survey has been 92 inscriptions related, directly or indirectly, with patrimonium Caesaris in Hispania*. To start with, I am going to examine the distribution by provinces and cities. In this regard Hispania Citerior stand out with 56 records, more than half of our catalogue. But this should not surprise us because it is the largest province in Hispania. Tarraco offers 15, Asturica Augusta-mineral capital of northwest-10, Villalís de Valduerna 7, Luyego 3 and Tresminas also 3. On the other hand, Baetica provides 23 records, we should mention also, Italica with 5 epigraphs, and Hispalis, Corduba, and Singilia Barba each having 3. Lusitania, for its part, gave 11 records, 5 of them coming from Emerita Augusta and, the other 3 from the mining region of Vispasca. With this information I have created a map with the dispersal of the epigraphical evidence related to the imperial properties. The big spots represent cities or areas that offer between 10 and 15 epigraphical records, the medium spots between four and five and finally the small spot only offers 1 inscription. In this research matter we are not only interested in the content of the epigraphs, that is to say, the text, but the place of origin is quite important. This map is very interesting because it offers us an initial approach to the geography of the patrimonium Caesaris in Hispania. With regards to the content of our epigraphs, we have divided the inscriptions into four big thematic areas: slaves, mines and quarries, the Kalendarium Vegetianum and the management of the imperial properties. On an average of 56 epigraphical records that may be clearly assigned to a category, 19 of them are connected to the servi Caesaris, 28 to imperial mines and quarries, 6 to Kalendarium Vegetianum and finally, 3 to the financial stewardship of the patrimonium. We have found a large number of epigraphs, concretely 19, that mention imperial slaves. Most of the slaves, and also enough freedmen, occupy management posts in the capitals of provinces ruled by the emperor, like Emerita Augusta and Tarraco. In other cases, their role is not expressed in the inscription. Another aspect that caught our particular attention is the abundance of imperial slaves recognized in the northwest of Hispania. We are speaking about pieces from: Brigantium, Aquae Celenae and Castrofeito. Probably, this servi Augusti may have been related with famous alluvial gold extracted in the rivers of this region. With reference to the mining, the own epigraphy indicates which were these mining areas ruled by the emperor: the Mons Marianus, the northwest mining area and the Iberian Pyrite Belt. 5 of the epigraphs provides us information about the mining of Mons Marianus. According to Tacitus (Ann. VI, 19, 1), Sextus Marius was the owner of both copper and gold mines which were confiscated by Tiberius. We know that this mining district was managed by a procurator. This has been shown by a pedestal found in Hispalis dedicated to Titus Flavius Polychrisus, procurator montis Marianis, and probably, which Dorotheus had. This imperial freedman was procurator massae Marianae according to an epigraph from Ostia. A votive inscription was found in the ancient mine called ""mina del Centenillo,"" this piece names Marcus Ulpius Hermeros, Augusti libertus. Other mining cities of this area were Obulco and Regina Turdulorum. In Obulco Succesianus, Augusti libertus developed his activity. And Privatus, dispensator et verna Augusti was buried in Regina Turdulorum. Nevertheless, the region which has offered more epigraphical evidence is the northwest mining area, mainly the district of El Bierzo, province of León. This should not surprise us because it was the most important gold mining area in the entire Roman Empire. In Villalis de Valduerna, Luyego de Somoza and Truchas an important group of ten epigraphs were discovered. Such inscriptions have the same external and internal features: votives pieces are devoted to Iupiter Optimus Maximus and for the health of emperors: Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, Marcus Aurelius solo and finally Commodus. This epigraphical tribute was done in the anniversary of the aquila, the symbol of a vexillatio, a detachment formed by legionary of the Legio septima. Certainly, this vexillatio was responsible for protecting and guarding this mining district. In fact, all epigraphs were dedicated by a military officer: a decurion and also by a libertus Augusti. We know: Aurelius Eutyches, Hermes, Zoilus and Aurelius Firmus. All of them were procuratores, but only Aurelius Firmus noted his complete position as procurator metallorum. Another piece found in northwest mentions another imperial freedmen, Marcus Ulpius Eutyches, procurator of metallum albocrarensium, probably a gold mining district. Finally, in Tresminas, situated in the north of conventus Bracarensis, were found three military inscriptions. The presence of troops in a mining area suggest that these mines were under imperial control The third large roman mining region in Hispania was the Iberian Pyrite Belt. We know a freedman procurator, surely a procurator metallorum, named Pudens. This inscription was found in a mining town called Fodinae Aeraria situated in the modern Rio Tinto. And, of course we must mention the Metallum Vipascense, mostly known for the Bronze Boards of Vipasca. One of these texts was written formally in the nature of a letter to Ulpius Aelianus, procurator of the mining district. We know another procurator thanks to a base of statue dedicated to Beryllus, Augusti libertus et rationalium vicarius. However, the emperors were not only interested in metal's mines. We have three pieces of epigraphical evidence about imperial marble quarries. In Italica two tabulae marmoreae were donated, one of them by Marcus Caelius Alexander who worked in a statio serrariorum Augusti. This was, according to some scholars, a marble workshop related to a quarry under imperial control. On the other hand, an ara was consecrate to Endovelicus by Hermes, marmorarius and slave of Vibia Aurelia Sabina, daughter of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Moreover, this piece was discovered in the marble quarries region of Vila Viçosa, Borba and Estremoz, one of the most important marble zones in ancient Hispania. Finally, six pieces provided us information about the Kalendarium Vegetianum. In general terms, a kalendarium was a loan funded and used by tenants farmers and clients to finance their agricultural or commercial activities using loans. The functions of the procurators or the economic activity of the kalendarium is not specified by the epigraphy. Nevertheless, the discovery of references to the kalendarium in amphoras Dressel 20 corroborated that the economic activity of this body was also related with the oil and amphora production. On the one hand, Marcus Lucretius Iulianus was procurator kalendarii Vegetiani and was honored in Italica with a statue. On the other hand, an epigraph found in Ilipa, tells us about Lucius Cominius Vipsanius Salutaris who was procurator of the Baetica and previously procurator of this imperial institution. This same position was held by Tiberius Claudius Proculus Cornelianus according with an epigraph of Lambaesis. To conclude, we must name three bases from Singilia Barba. Two of the inscriptions honor Publius Magnius Rufus Magonianus, an equestrian administrator who was procurator Augusti per Baeticam ad kalendarium Vegetianum. The third honors Rufus' wife, Carvilia Censonilla. Lastly, the epigraphical survey also gives us information about the financial management of the patrimonium Caesaris. One of the most important epigraphs of our catalogue is a pedestal found in Italica dedicated to Marcus Rutilius Cosinius Gallus, procurator Augusti patrimonii Baeticae. This is, up to now, the only procurator of imperial state known in the Iberian Peninsula. Additionally, we have information about subordinate staff, an epitaph from Hispalis was dedicated to Felix, probably an imperial slave, who worked as dispensator arcae patrimonii. Also we know a to Aurelius Rufus who served in Emerita Augusta as tabularius provinciae Lusitaniae rationis patrimonii. Dispersal of the epigraphical evidence related to the imperial properties *The total sum does not include the records provided by the amphoric epigraphy.

Modeling the Perceptual Distortion of Dynamic Textures and Its Application in HEVC,"In the quest of perceptually optimized video coding , coding textures is representing a challenging case. While a large body of research was put into the perception of static textures , dynamic textures are still not sufficiently explored. In this paper , we focus on short term consistent patches , known as dynamic textures , with a very limited spatial and temporal extent. We estimated the visual distortion due to HEVC compression via subjective testing. The estimated distortion profile per texture was used to optimize the HEVC coding process. Experimental results showed that this technique can offer a high bitrate saving for the same subjective quality .","['info', 'spi']"
Soil variations in northern French Guiana that could modify forest dynamics,"Des facteurs du milieu tels que le sol et la topographie influencent la productivité et la biomasse de la forêt tropicale humide. Extrapoler à l'échelle d'un pays les données de biomasse qui sont disponibles à une échelle locale demande donc de connaître l'organisation des sols à l'échelle d'un pays. En Guyane française, cette organisation des sols est très bien connue à une échelle locale avec le type de drainage comme principal facteur de différenciation des sols. Mais elle est moins connue à l'échelle plus large de la Guyane. Les objectifs de cette étude sont de donner un premier aperçu de l'organisation des sols forestiers du nord de la Guyane ainsi que de leur niveau de fertilité chimique en tenant compte de la pluviosité annuelle (2000 à 4000 mm), la géologie (quatre substrats) et la topographie (sommet et pentes), facteurs clés avec le temps qui influencent la pédogénèse. Nous avons étudié sept placettes permanentes de forêt naturelle du réseau Guyafor. Nous avons observé des sols homogènes et présentant de meilleures propriétés physiques (sols à drainage vertical libre) au nord-est de la Guyane, région avec les plus fortes pluviosités. Par contre, les sols observés au nord-ouest, région avec de plus faibles pluviosités, ont des propriétés physiques variables selon la topographie et la géologie. L'effet direct de la pluviosité reste cependant incertain compte-tenu d'un dispositif expérimental incomplet. Nous avons aussi observé que la géologie et la topographie exerçaient une influence sur les propriétés chimiques des sols au travers de la texture. Nous avons observé des corrélations positives entre argile, carbone et capacité d'échange cationique et des corrélations négatives entre argile et phosphore assimilable. D'après ces résultats, on s'attend à ce que la productivité et la biomasse de la forêt soient les plus importantes dans les régions avec les pluviosités les plus élevées et avec soient variables en lien avec la topographie et la géologie dans les régions de pluviosités plus faibles.","['sdv', 'sde']"
On a statistical package for non-expert users,"In recent days, statistical methods are applied in a vast extent of different disciplines by a lot of people that, very often, have a rather little knowledge of statistics. This fact can lead to misuse of statistical methods, mainly due to the fact that the users are not able to evaluate the appropriateness and the applicability of the selected methodology, although these methods are rather simple. In addition, these users can be terrified by a statistical output with which they are not familiar. The statistical community has recognized this fact and now statistical packages try to offer some guidance to their users. This paper presents the design of a statistical package, oriented to users with medium or little knowledge of statistics. This package enhances some kind of ‘expertise’ in order to prevent the users from statistical maltreatment. We focus on the statistical part of such software and mainly on the idea of providing statistical guidance in several steps of the analysis to the user in an elegant way. These steps include selection of the appropriate method, application of the method in an optimum way and construction of outputs that beyond plain numbers offer an explanation of the results in simple language. The results of a survey about the user requirements of such a software are presented.",['math']
Nautilus: Real-Time Interaction Between Dancers and Augmented Reality with Pixel-Cloud Avatars,"Real-time interaction with augmented reality is a novel material for dancers and choreographers to work with on stage. Rather than focusing on a perfect synchronization between dance and music, it allows the dancers to affect their audiovisual environment and react to the change. In this paper, we report the process and outcome of a col-laborative effort between art and technology that has explored this new material and resulted in the dance performance Nautilus. We suggest an interaction method based on a depth sensor and pixel-cloud avatars that allows the dancers to interact reliably with an augmented reality while moving freely on stage.L'interaction en temps réel avec la réalité augmentée re-présente un nouveau matériel avec lequel les danseurs et chorégraphes peuvent travailler pour leurs spectacles.

When the Workers Were Communists,"The once mighty French Communist Party is a shell of its former self. What happened to its mass base? The French Communist Party (PCF) once commanded the loyalty of millions. Buoyed by its role in the resistance to Nazi occupation, the party won over a quarter of the vote in postwar legislative elections and was a permanent fixture in French life. In much of Northern Europe, the working class owed its allegiance to the parties of social democracy. In France, the Communists had that honor. Though the party today can still claim the country’s third largest membership, its decline has been dramatic. The bulk of opposition to France’s political establishment has been generated from the Right, in the form of the xenophobic populism of the National Front. We spoke to sociologist Julian Mischi about the Communist Party’s decline in this new environment and how it can reconnect with a largely lost social base.",['shs']

Adaptive Digital Resource Modeling as Service Provider and Consumer,"The increase in the production of heterogeneous and multi-source digital data over last years raises several issues regarding their management and use. Hence, users can face some difficulties in selecting the adequate digital resources and combining them to reach their objectives in a given activity. In this paper, we focus on digital resources design and management in order to enhance their retrieval, interoperability, adaptation and collaboration within an adaptive system. In practical terms, our work consists in a new method for digital resource design and management capable of enhancing their usability. It relies on RESTful web service-based methodology and platform thinking approach. We have implemented our method in an interactive and adaptive PLE to assist researchers in using and managing their digital resources, called PRISE for PeRsonal Interactive research Smart Environment.

The result showed that modeling digital resources with RESTful and platform thinking concept enhances digital resource usability in terms of retrieving, interoperability, adaptation and collaboration.",['info']
OAISIS: an Ontological-based Approach for Interlinking CrowdSensing Information Systems,"Nowadays, smartphones and wearable devices are endowed with several sensors, which can harvest large quantities of data about urban areas (location information, pollution levels, etc.), going through a list of personal and surrounding contexts such as noise level, traffic awareness, to name a few. Exploiting this wealth of information provided by the crowd allows devel- opers to design and build several applications over the so-called Mobile CrowdSensing, such as traffic regulation, environmental monitoring, tourism recommendation, etc. However, for this to be possible, many barriers still have to be overcome such as collecting, handling, structuring and representing the crowd data in a suitable way. In this paper, we propose a three-fold solution to the problem of data management in CrowdSensing systems. Firstly, we structure the collected data based on semantic ontologies. Secondly, we enrich the data based on a novel contextual awareness data interlinking. Finally, we refine recommendations with contexts, through taking into consideration meta-information interlinked to the main information of interest. We have implemented our model in a tourism recommendation application as a proof of concept. The experimental evaluation – which we carried out – has shown very promising results.",['info']
STRIVE: Socially-aware Three-tier Routing in Information-centric Vehicular Environment,"Content distribution in vehicular networks is greatly impaired by high mobility and intermittent connectivity. Social-aware content distribution schemes based on typical centrality metrics address the challenge, however they suffer due to their network-centric nature instead of information centric. We suggest to exploit the recently proposed information-centric networking architecture which cater the issue by decoupling host-user and support in-network caching at intermediate nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel information-centric social-aware content distribution protocol, STRIVE confining the broadcast nature of interest/content by routing it selectively towards high centrality information facilitator vehicles. We use a three-tier forwarding strategy to discover potential local and global information facil-itators in an urban environment for efficient content delivery. The performance evaluation implements a scalable simulation environment deploying up to 2986 vehicles using realistic vehicular mobility traces. Simulation results show that our proposed novel vehicle centrality based content distribution protocol, STRIVE outperforms existing social content distribution metrics used in the literature.",['info']

Pandemic economics: Optimal dynamic confinement under uncertainty and learning,"Most integrated models of the Covid pandemic have been developed under the assumption that the policy-sensitive reproduction number is certain. The decision to exit from the lockdown has been made in most countries without knowing the reproduction number that would prevail after the deconfinement. In this paper, I explore the role of uncertainty and learning on the optimal dynamic lockdown policy. I limit the analysis to suppression strategies. In the absence of uncertainty, the optimal confinement policy is to impose a constant rate of lockdown until the suppression of the virus in the population. I show that introducing uncertainty about the reproduction number of deconfined people reduces the optimal initial rate of confinement.",['shs']

"The type of Rapa Shearwater Puffinus (newelli?) myrtae from the Austral Islands, Polynesia, with remarks on the morphological variation of the taxon.","Rapa Shearwater Puffinus (newelli?) myrtae is known solely from five specimens held in Tring and Paris museums, and from observations on the breeding islands. It has a potentially tiny breeding population that is apparently restricted currently to islets off Rapa (it formerly also bred on the main island of Rapa), as well as probably on Marotiri (south of Rapa), in the Austral Islands, Polynesia. Clear differences in morphology between the series in Paris and the holotype in Tring can be explained in terms of age-related variation, with the latter specimen being a juvenile. As a result, we describe adult plumage in detail for the first time. Genetic analysis confirmed that the Paris and Tring specimens can be unequivocally referred to the same taxon.",['sde']

METHODOLOGY OF A COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN OF SHRINK FIT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ROUGHNESS AND FORM DEFECTS OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS,"The assembly technique of interference fit (shrink fit) is increasingly used today. However, the design methodologies for these assemblies use older models based on very restrictive assumptions about the shape and the surface quality of assembled parts. FEM software are now often used to overcome these drawbacks. They allow an approach closer to the physical reality of the parts (complex form). However, the surfaces are generally considered to be perfect cylinders and the tightening, constant. The proposed approach makes it possible to introduce, in the design, both form defects and roughness, thus taking into account the manufacturing process. For this, form defect is integrated directly in the mesh while roughness is taken into account by an homogenized finite element of interface. An example of an application to determine specifications which take the manufacturing process (honing, grinding, turning, etc.) into account is presented. This simple method can be easily applied in industrial design offices.",['spi']

A Quality Model for AAL Software Systems,"The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain aims to support the daily life activities of elders, patients with chronic conditions or disabled people, with a focus on ICT (Informatics and Communication Technologies). Important advances in AAL software systems have been already made, assisting people in their home, work, and social environments. Because of their critical nature, these systems must be developed focused on their quality. Hence, quality attributes (QAs), such as safety, reliability, and security, must be identified and well defined to successfully achieve the system purposes. However, there is not a set of QAs specific for AAL systems, hence, new systems have been developed based on general standards, such as ISO/IEC 25010, or based on particular experiences. This paper introduces the QM4AAL, a quality model (QM) for AAL systems. The QM4AAL was established and evaluated based on evidence from several published works found through conduction of a systematic mapping study. As result, the QM4AAL details QAs requirements, adaptive (e.g., self-configuring or situation-aware) or static properties, and stakeholders of AAL systems and their constituents systems (e.g., activity monitoring or health status monitoring systems). We intend this QM can orient the design and assessment of current and future AAL systems.","['info', 'sdv']"

Scalable and exhaustive screening of metabolic functions carried out by microbial consortia,"Motivation: The selection of species exhibiting metabolic behaviors of interest is a challenging step when switching from the investigation of a large microbiota to the study of functions effectiveness. Approaches based on a compartmentalized framework are not scalable. The output of scal-able approaches based on a non-compartmentalized modeling may be so large that it has neither been explored nor handled so far. Results: We present the Miscoto tool to facilitate the selection of a community optimizing a desired function in a microbiome by reporting several possibilities which can be then sorted according to biological criteria. Communities are exhaustively identified using logical programming and by combining the non-compartmentalized and the compartmentalized frameworks. The benchmark-ing of 4.9 million metabolic functions associated with the Human Microbiome Project, shows that Miscoto is suited to screen and classify metabolic producibility in terms of feasibility, functional redundancy and cooperation processes involved. As an illustration of a host-microbial system, screening the Recon 2.2 human metabolism highlights the role of different consortia within a family of 773 intestinal bacteria.

Miniature Antenna for Breast Tumor Detection,"Microwave imaging is recognized as a potential candidate for biomedical applications, such as breast cancer detection. In this context a miniature antenna is used for quantitative imaging of inhomogeneous tissues. Microwave breast imaging (MBI) uses low power and longer wavelength signals to obtain information about breast tissues, and promises a safer and more accurate modality for regular breast scanning. This paper presents a miniature microstrip antenna that can be placed in contact with the breast model to investigate the presence of malignant tissues. A miniature antenna has been designed, and placed toward a breast phantom model with inhomogeneous tissues. Images are successfully obtained by using scattering electromagnetic waves (S11) from the designed model. The antenna was then manufactured and tested. In this paper the design of a miniature antenna for microwave imaging has been presented. This antenna aims to overcome the limitation of the conventional solutions by detecting breast tumors regardless its evolution stages. The simulation results show that the response of the antenna is affected in terms of frequency and return loss when it’s implanted on the heterogeneous model. Indeed, comparing to the normal breast model simulated response, the frequency was down shifted of around 100 MHz and the S11 parameter was improved. The antenna has been fabricated using plexyglass substrate and the measured results confirm the resonance frequency shift from 2.63 GHz to 2.54 GHz and the S11 improvement from -12 dB to -18 dB These results are respectively obtained when the antenna is implemented on two different mediums: clean serum representing a human body with absence of tumor and serum with steel balls representing human body with presence of tumor. After this first proof-of-concept, it’s intended to design the antenna using a flexible substrate and to perform real tests using samples representing tumors in human body which would be given by the research team of CHRU (Centre Hospitalier Régional et Universitaire de Brest) in Brest - France.",['spi']
Integration of geospatial data for mapping variation of sediment thickness in the North Sea,"The study presents geospatial analysis of the seabed distribution of North Sea sediments. Data include thematic datasets with a high-resolution: GlobSed 5-arc-minute total sediment thickness grid combined with GEBCO regional bathymetric grid and geophysical grids showing EGM2008 geoid undulations and marine free-air gravity. The data have been processed using GMT. The data analysis revealed variations in the occurrence and distribution of sediment materials as well as its relationship with topography and regional geophysical settings, marine free-air gravity and geoid. Analysis of the topographic map was performed to describe the structural features of the seafloor. Ridges, large-scale sandbanks, shallow coastal areas and local depressions illustrate uneven bathymetry with northward increasing depths. The highest recorded value is 12,779.642 m located in the northern ares in the SW coast of Norway. Moderate values of sediment thickness (5,000-6,000 m) stretching in NW direction clearly correlate with the marine gravity anomaly isolines with values 10-20 mGal which points at the local relief forms in central basin of the North Sea. The subsidence of the outer shelf of the North Sea and increase of sediment thickness is notable in the central depressions and northern areas: Faroe Islands and Rockall Plateau. The sediment thickness shows the relationship with the topography increasing toward high latitudes. It is also associated with the isostatic sink of the submarine relief in the peripheral areas of the Arctic Ocean. Topographic compensation for the seafloor subsidence by increasing sediment thickness explains local dislocations connected with submarine geomorphology. This study also demonstrated that accurate GMT-based cartographic visualization of the oceanic seafloor using high-resolution multi-source raster grids is crucial to better understand spatial distribution of the marine sediments in the northern latitudes of the North Atlantic Ocean.",['phys']
Automation for Robotics,"In order to enable a better understanding of the key concepts of automation, this book develops the fundamental aspects of the field while also proposing numerous concrete exercises and their solutions. The theoretical approach that it presents fundamentally uses the state space and makes it possible to process general and complex systems in a simple way, involving several switches and sensors of different types. This approach requires the use of developed theoretical tools such as linear algebra, analysis and physics, generally taught in preparatory classes for specialist engineering courses.",['spi']
Application of High Performance Photoinitiating Systems for Holographic Grating Recording,"In this chapter, a compilation of different systems able to photogenerate active radicals toward polymerization reaction( type I, type II and three component photoinitiating systems) for application in holographic grating recording when associated to monomers is reviewed. In particular, the visible curable system is associated to fluorinated acrylate monomers formulation for creation of transmission gratings. The PIS efficiencies are presented in term of diffraction grating yields and compared to photopolymerization experiments. The special case of photocyclic initiating systems is described in details, its influence on the grating built up being discussed on the basis of selected mixtures using visible dyes, electron donors (e.g. amines), electron acceptors (e.g. iodonium salts) or hydrogen donors as coinitiators. The role of the photochemical properties of dye on the performance of the holographic recording material is investigated through time resolved and steady state spectroscopic studies of the PIS (e.g. nanosecond laser flash photolysis), to highlight the photochemistry underlying active radicals photogeneration. In order to get more insight into the hologram formation, grating formation curves were compared to those of monomer to polymer conversion obtained by real time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (RTFTIR). This work outlines the importance of the coupling between the photoinitiating system (i.e. the photochemical reactions) and the holographic resin.",['chim']
R Libraries {dendextend} and {magrittr} and Clustering Package scipy.cluster of Python For Modelling Diagrams of Dendrogram Trees,"The paper presents a comparison of the two languages Python and R related to the classification tools and demonstrates the differences in their syntax and graphical output. It indicates the functionality of R and Python packages {dendextend} and scipy.cluster as effective tools for the dendrogram modelling by the algorithms of sorting and ranking datasets. R and Python programming languages have been tested on a sample dataset including marine geological measurements. The work aims to detect how bathymetric data change along the 25 bathymetric profiles digitized across the Mariana Trench. The methodology includes performed hierarchical cluster analysis with dendrograms and plotted clustermap with marginal dendrograms. The statistical libraries include Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas by Python and {dendextend}, {pvclust}, {magrittr} by R. The dendrograms were compared by the model-simulated clusters of the bathymetric ranges. The results show three distinct groups of the profiles sorted by the elevation ranges with maximal depths detected in a group of profiles 19-21. The dendrogram visualization in a cluster analysis demonstrates the effective representation of the data sorting, grouping and classifying by the machine learning algorithms. The programming codes presented in this study enable to sort a dataset in a similar research aimed to group data based on the similarity of attributes. Effective visualization by dendrograms is a useful modelling tool for the geospatial management where data ranking is required. Plotting dendrograms by R, comparing to Python, presented functional and sophisticated algorithms, refined design control and fine graphical data output. The interdisciplinary nature of this work consists in application of the coding algorithms for spatial data analysis.",['info']
Robust set-membership parameter estimation of the glucose minimal model,"The minimal model of glucose-insulin dynamics is currently being used in several diabetes-related applications, such as investigating the glucose metabolism, and in the developments of model predictive controllers and fault detection techniques for automatic blood glucose control (i.e., artificial pancreas). Different approaches have been proposed to identify this model, but none of them is capable of providing guaranteed robust enclosures for its parameters, something very desired in applications such as the artificial pancreas, where robustness is paramount. This paper presents a novel approach for guaranteed set-membership parameter estimation of the minimal model based on the well-renowned Set Inversion via Interval Analysis (SIVIA) algorithm. Because the computational complexity of this algorithm is the main barrier for its applicability, an efficient vectorial implementation of SIVIA was employed. Clinical data from a standard intravenous glucose tolerance test were used to prove the validity of the presented approach. Finally, Modal Interval Analysis was used to reduce the numerical overestimation due to the dependency problem of interval arithmetic and significantly speeding up the computations.",['spi']
Towards Fast and Reliable Localization of an Underwater Object: An Interval Approach,"To localize an underwater object, we measure the distance to this object from several sonar sensors with known locations. The problem is that the signal sent by some of the sonars is re ected not by the desired object(s), but by some auxiliary object and thus, the values measured by these sensors are drastically dierent from the distance to the desired object. To solve this problem, currently probabilistic methods are used; however, since we do not know the exact probability distributions, these methods may miss the actual location of the object. There exist interval-based methods which provide guaranteed (reliable) bounds on the object's location, but these methods sometimes require too much computation time. In this paper, we propose a new faster algorithm for reliable localization of underwater objects.",['spi']
Separator Algebra for State Estimation,"In this paper, we show how it is possible to find both an inner and an outer approximations for X(t).

The main idea is to copy a classical contractor approach [CJ09] for state estimation, but to use separators [JD14] instead of contractors.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"

Selection of Measurement Method for Detection of Driver Visual Cognitive Distraction: A Review,"Driving distraction is a topic of great interest in the transport safety-research community, because it is now a primary cause of road accidents. A recent report has revealed that distraction is more alarming than previously thought, and a suitable measurement to effectively detect distraction is required. Most agree that driving distraction actually comprises the simultaneous interaction of two or more types of distraction. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to determine the promising method for measuring visual cognitive distraction. We discuss the five common measurement methods for visual and cognitive driving distraction, which include driving performance, driver physical measures, driver biological measures, subjective reports, and hybrid measures. Hybrid measurement of driver's physical measures (e.g., eye movement) and driver's biological measures (e.g., electroencephalogram) is better than other methods at detecting types of visual cognitive distraction. This new perspective on measurement methods will help the field of transport safety to determine the best means of detecting and measuring the effect of visual cognitive distraction.","['info', 'spi']"
Organic Electronics: an El Dorado in the quest of new photoCatalysts as photoinitiators of polymerization,"Photoinitiated polymerization has been the subject of continued research efforts due to the numerous applications in which this polymerization technique is involved (coatings, inks, adhesives, optoelectronic, laser imaging, stereolithography, nanotechnology, etc.). More recently, photopolymerization has received renewed interest due to the emergence of 3D-printing technologies. However, despite current academic and industrial interest in photopolymerization methodologies, a major limitation lies in the slow rates of photopolymerization. The development of new photoinitiating systems aimed at addressing this limitation is an active area of research. Photopolymerization occurs through the exposure of a curable formulation to light, generating radical and/or cationic species to initiate polymerization. At present, photopolymerization is facing numerous challenges related to safety, economic and ecological concerns. Furthermore, practical considerations such as the curing depth and the competition for light absorption between the chromophores and other species in the formulation are key parameters drastically affecting the photopolymerization process. To address these issues, photoinitiating systems operating under low intensity visible light irradiation, in the absence of solvents are highly sought after. In this context, the use of photoredox catalysis can be highly advantageous; that is, photoredox catalysts can provide high reactivities with low catalyst loading, permitting access to high performance photoinitiating systems. However, to act as efficient photoredox catalysts, specific criteria have to be fulfilled. A strong absorption over the visible range, an ability to easily oxidize or reduce as well as sufficient photochemical stability are basic prerequisites to make these molecules desirable candidates for photoredox catalysis. Considering the similarity of requirements between organic electronics and photopolymerization, numerous materials initially designed for applications in organic electronics have been revisited in the context of photopolymerization. Organic electronics is a branch of electronics and materials science focusing on the development of semiconductors devoted to three main research fields; organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs). The contribution of organic electronics to the field of electronics is important as it paves the way toward cheaper, lighter, and more energy efficient devices. In the present context of photopolymerization, materials that were investigated as photocatalysts were indifferently organic semiconductors used for transistors, charge-transport materials, and light-emitting materials used in electroluminescent devices or conjugated polymers and small molecule dyes for solar cells. In this Account, we summarize our latest developments in elaborating on photocatalytic systems based on these new classes of compounds. Through an in-depth understanding of the parameters governing their reactivities and our efforts to incorporate these materials into photoinitiating systems, we provide new knowledge and a valuable insight for future prospects.",['chim']
Optimal bursts in turbulent channel flow,"Bursts are recurrent, transient, highly energetic events characterized by localized variations of velocity and vorticity in turbulent wall-bounded flows. In this work, a nonlinear energy optimization strategy is employed to investigate whether the origin of such bursting events in a turbulent channel flow can be related to the presence of high-amplitude coherent structures. The results show that bursting events correspond to optimal energy flow structures embedded in the fully turbulent flow. In particular, optimal structures inducing energy peaks at short time are initially composed of highly oscillating vortices and streaks near the wall. At moderate friction Reynolds numbers, through the bursts, energy is exchanged between the streaks and packets of hairpin vortices of different sizes reaching the outer scale. Such an optimal flow configuration reproduces well the spatial spectra as well as the probability density function typical of turbulent flows, recovering the mechanism of direct-inverse energy cascade. These results represent an important step towards understanding the dynamics of turbulence at moderate Reynolds numbers and pave the way to new nonlinear techniques to manipulate and control the self-sustained turbulence dynamics.","['spi', 'phys']"
Transient growth of perturbations in Stokes oscillatory flows,"Oscillatory Stokes flows, with zero mean, are subjected to subcritical transition to turbulence. The maximal energy growth of perturbations is computed in the subcritical regime through an optimisation method. The results show strong amplifications during half a period. The energy transfer from the base flow involves an Orr mechanism with two-dimensional vorticity waves, and the maximum energy scales exponentially with the Reynolds number. Nonlinear simulations show that low-energy perturbations are sufficient to trigger turbulent flow.",['spi']
Classification of bacteria using FT-IR,"The classification of bacteria is generally based on their morphology and biochemical reactions. However, using these methods is time consuming, and require training and expertise. Infrared (IR) spectroscopic measurements of bacteria followed by a formal chemometric analysis could offer advantages including speed and consistency. Such an analysis was first carried out in the late 1950s, with some success, but with limitations imposed both by the instrumentation and by the post-processing tools available. Modern tools, however, allow quick and consistent results.","['sdv', 'spi']"

Objectivity in Mathematics: The Structuralist Roots of a Pragmatic Realism,"Abstract This paper proposes a reconsideration of mathematical structuralism, inaugurated by Bourbaki, by adopting the “practical turn” that owes much to Henri Poincare. By reconstructing his group theoretic approach of geometry, it seems possible to explain the main difficulty of modern philosophical eliminative and non-eliminative structuralism: the unclear ontological status of ‘structures’ and ‘places’. The formation of the group concept—a ‘universal’—is suggested by a specific system of stipulated sensations and, read as a relational set, the general group concept constitutes a model of the group axioms, which are exemplified (in the Goodmanian sense) by the sensation system. In other words, the shape created in the mind leads to a particular type of platonistic universals, which is a model (in the model theoretical sense) of the mathematical axiom system of the displacement group. The elements of the displacement group are independent and complete entities with respect to the axiom system of the group. But, by analyzing the subgroups of the displacement group (common to geometries with constant curvature) one transforms the variables of the axiom system in ‘places’ whose ‘objects’ lack any ontological commitment except with respect to the specified axioms. In general, a structure R is interpreted as a second order relation, which is exemplified by a system of axioms according to the pragmatic maxim of Peirce.","['math', 'shs']"
"The Governance Context of Drought Policy and Pilot Measures for the Arzal Dam and Reservoir, Vilaine Catchment, Brittany, France","This chapter presents an analysis of the drought adaptation governance of the Vilaine catchment in the Brittany region in France and, more specifically, of the Arzal dam and reservoir located at the outlet of the river. Accordingly, the analysis focuses on the lower part of the Vilaine catchment, where two pilot studies were conducted during the DROP project. The material for the analysis was collected during two field visits. The first visit occurred from 16 to 18 September 2013, and the second from 16 to 18 June 2014, during which the Governance Team (GT) met stakeholders, managers and representatives of the relevant local action groups. The analysis is also based on several documents provided by the Institution d 'Aménagement de la Vilaine (IAV), one practice partner of the DROP project responsible for the management of the Arzal dam and its reservoir. IAV also plays a key role in supporting water management at the catchment scale of the Vilaine River. After a presentation of the French drought context (Sect. 6.2 ), including the description of the water management and drought adaptation strategies adopted in France, this chapter describes the main water use management issues for the Arzal dam and reservoir (Sect. 6.3 ). Section 6.4 is dedicated to the interpretation of the results of the drought governance analysis which was supported by the implementation of the drought governance assessment tool (GAT). Finally, in Sect. 6.5 , some recommendations are proposed regarding possible measures to improve local drought adaptation strategies.","['sde', 'phys']"

Color Theory,"Color is the result of the visual perception of an energy source. It is described by its physical characteristics, mainly as a tridimensional variable modeled into a color space. Online tools exist to facilitate the use of color schemes to design a color palette, for artists, web designers, statisticians, etc. Colors in maps and visualizations must be combined to promote the visual hierarchy and harmony, balancing legibility, perceptual processing, and aesthetics. Color is a powerful visual variable and requires understanding the perception of color relationships. Existing color schemes are very useful to select a suitable color palette. As color is not experienced similarly across all map readers, issues about real-world connotations, conventions, specific color contrasts, and adaptation to color visual deficiencies and devices, are also to be taken into account when designing a color palette. This entry describes the main guidelines regarding color theory and related design practices as applied to map or geovisualization design.","['spi', 'shs']"

Evaluation of a computer-based simulation for the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms,"Purpose: Endovascular treatment (EVT) of intracranial aneurysms requires highly trained physicians and careful pre-therapeutic evaluation of the aneurysm morphology. A realistic interventional neuroradiology simulator would provide procedural and skill training for either educational purpose or pre-therapeutic simulation in complex cases. This work aims at evaluating the clinical realism of a computer-based simulator for the EVT of aneurysms. Material and Methods: A prototype computer-based EVT simulation system was developed and implemented. A silicon vascular phantom (Elastrat, Geneva, Switzerland) as well as two patient data sets were used for the evaluation. A coil adapted to the aneurysm was deployed under fluoroscopy. Then, a simulation was done with the same, as well as larger and smaller coils under the same viewing incidence and was visually assessed and compared to fluoroscopic images. The maximum of coil pressure onto the aneurysm sac was recorded during all simulations. Results: In all cases, simulation with the correct coil showed a realistic coil behaviour and aneurysm filling. As expected, full and stable coiling of the aneurysm was impossible to simulate with too small coils. Protrusions outside the sac were observed with too large coils. In this latter case, the pressure onto the aneurysm wall dramatically increased as compared with the correct coil. Conclusion: A preliminary evaluation of a computer-based EVT simulation system was made on both phantom and patient data. Our report emphasizes the clinical realism of the simulated deployment of coils, in particular with regard to potential hazards related to an inadequate choice of coil.","['sdv', 'info']"

EcotoxicityEcotoxicité,"Ecotoxicity impact assessment of chemicals in life cycle assessment (LCA) adheres to a number of underlying principles and boundary conditions: 1) a large number of emitted substances to cover (at least 100,000 potentially relevant elementary flows with current models covering around 2500), 2) linearity of characterisation models, 3) conservation of mass and mass balance, 4) infinite time horizon, 5) additivity of toxicity, 6) assuming average conditions as best estimates to avoid bias in the comparison (including consideration of generic/average ecosystems and impacts). The cause-effect mechanism for ecotoxicity impacts of chemicals can be divided into four parts: 1) chemical fate (i.e. chemical behaviour/distribution in the environment), 2) exposure (i.e. bioavailability), 3) effects (i.e. affected species), and 4) severity (i.e. disappeared species). In terms of species represented, a freshwater ecosystem is described in this chapter by three trophic levels: 1) primary producers (e.g. algae), 2) primary consumers (i.e. invertebrates), and 3) secondary consumers (e.g. fish). Model uncertainty was estimated at about three orders of magnitude on top of important sources of parameter uncertainty such as degradation rates and effect factors. Current midpoint LCIA methodologies covering ecotoxicity include TRACI 2.0, and the ILCD recommended methodology, both employing the USEtox factors. Current LCIA methodologies covering midpoint and endpoint characterisation are ReCiPe, LIME, IMPACT 2002+, and IMPACT World+. Important research needs are 1) increasing substance coverage, 2) further developing marine and terrestrial ecotoxicity modelling for midpoint, 3) improving endpoint modelling for ecotoxicity towards biodiversity, 4) consideration of long-term emissions and impacts of metals, 5) importance of spatial and temporal variability, 6) mixture toxicity, and 7) decreasing model and parameter uncertainty.",['sde']
"Scientific Opinion on Flavouring Group Evaluation 57, Revision 1 (FGE.57Rev1): consideration of isopulegone and three flavouring substances evaluated by JECFA (55th meeting)","The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids was requested to consider evaluations of flavouring substances assessed since 2000 by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), and to decide whether further evaluation is necessary, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1565/2000. The present consideration concerns a group of four flavouring substances consisting of isopulegone and three other substances evaluated by JECFA at the 55th meeting. This revision is made due to additional toxicity data available for (1R, 2S, 5R)-isopulegol [FL-no: 02.067]. The substances were evaluated through a stepwise approach that integrates information on structure-activity relationships, intake from current uses, toxicological threshold of concern, and available data on metabolism and toxicity. p-Mentha-1,4(8)-dien-3-one [FL-no: 07.127] is no longer supported by the flavour industry and was not evaluated. In agreement with JECFA, the Panel evaluated the candidate substances in this Flavouring Group Evaluation (FGE) via the B-side of the Procedure. Based on a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) from a 90-day oral toxicity study on [FL-no: 02.067], adequate margins of safety for the three candidate substances could be calculated. Therefore, the Panel agrees with the JECFA conclusion, 'No safety concern at estimated levels of intake as flavouring substances' based on the maximised survey-derived daily intake (MSDI) approach. Besides the safety assessment of these flavouring substances, the specifications for the materials of commerce have also been considered and found adequate. For the three substances evaluated in this FGE, use levels have become available and the modified theoretical added maximum daily intakes (mTAMDIs) were estimated. For [FL-no: 02.067 and 07.067], the mTAMDI exceeds the toxicological threshold of concern for their structural classes and need more refined exposure assessment to finalise the evaluation.",['sdv']

A Multilingual Approach to Discover Cross-Language Links in Wikipedia,"Wikipedia is a well-known public and collaborative ency- clopaedia consisting of millions of articles. Initially in English, the pop- ular website has grown to include versions in over 288 languages. These versions and their articles are interconnected via cross-language links, which not only facilitate navigation and understanding of concepts in multiple languages, but have been used in natural language processing applications, developments in linked open data, and expansion of minor Wikipedia language versions. These applications are the motivation for an automatic, robust, and accurate technique to identify cross-language links. In this paper, we present a multilingual approach called EurekaCL to automatically identify missing cross-language links in Wikipedia. More precisely, given a Wikipedia article (the source) EurekaCL uses the mul- tilingual and semantic features of BabelNet 2.0 in order to efficiently identify a set of candidate articles in a target language that are likely to cover the same topic as the source. The Wikipedia graph structure is then exploited both to prune and to rank the candidates. Our eval- uation carried out on 42,000 pairs of articles in eight language versions of Wikipedia shows that our candidate selection and pruning procedures allow an effective selection of candidates which significantly helps the determination of the correct article in the target language version.",['info']
Any discontinuous PWA function is optimal solution to a parametric linear programming problem,"Recent studies have investigated the continuous functions in terms of inverse optimality. The continuity is a primordial structural property which is exploited in order to link a given piecewise affine (PWA) function to an optimization problem. The aim of this work is to deepen the study of the PWA functions in the inverse optimality context and specifically deal with the presence of discontinuities. First, it will be shown that a solution to the inverse optimality problem exists via a constructive argument. The loss of continuity will have an implication on the structure of the optimization problem which, albeit convex, turns to have a set-valued optimal solution. As a consequence, the original PWA function will represent an optimal solution but the uniqueness is lost. From the numerical point of view, we introduce an algorithm to construct an optimization problem that admits a given discontinuous PWA function as an optimal solution. This construction is shown to rely on convex liftings. A numerical example is considered to illustrate the proposal.",['spi']

A novel naphthalimide scaffold based iodonium salt as a one-component photoacid/photoinitiator for cationic and radical polymerization under LED exposure,"A strong drawback of the photoinitiators of cationic polymerization or photoacids is the photosensitivity for short and energetic wavelengths preventing their general use (specialized photochemical equipment with safety concerns must be used). In the present paper, a novel iodonium salt bearing a naphthalimide moiety (naphthalimide-Ph-I+-Ph) is proposed as a one-component photoinitiator/photoacid operating at longer and safer wavelengths (i.e. violet light emitting diodes at 365, 385 nm and 395 nm). It allows the polymerization of various formulations (methacrylates, epoxides, vinyl ethers). A high reactive function conversion for multifunctional monomers can be achieved: e.g. 50% for a diepoxide under air, >90% for a divinylether (with a very high rate of polymerization Rp), almost 100% for an epoxide/vinyl ether blend (very high Rp) under air, and 85% for methacrylates (high Rp) in laminate (43% under air). These results are above the ones obtained with a thianthrenium salt chosen as a reference e.g. a lower epoxy conversion ∼25% and a clearly lower Rp for the diepoxide polymerization. ESR-spin trapping, laser flash photolysis, steady state photolysis and molecular orbitals calculations support the formation of Ph˙ and naphthalimide-Ph-I˙+ as well as the generation of H+, thereby explaining the photoinitiation step mechanism.",['chim']
Use of a Virtual Environment to Engage Motor and Postural Abilities in Elderly Subjects With and Without Mild Cognitive Impairment (MAAMI Project),"Objectives: In the context of rehabilitation, the use of new technology such as Virtual Reality Technology (VRT) offers multiple possibilities to modulate the functional stimulation of subjects according to needs.Material and methods: In this study, the validity and reliability of our VRT system were investigated in fifteen healthy aged adults (HAA) and seven aged subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One implicit session was designed through two virtual environments (VEs) in order to induce the adapted activities associated with balance and postural control. In comparison, the same activities were achieved in explicit sessions with a physiotherapist. This cross-over study made use of a qualitative method to collect participants' feelings in both implicit and explicit sessions.Results: The results allowed us to validate the embedded technologies in our system and also the VE features for MCI subjects and their healthy counterparts. The analysis of participants' feelings showed that implicit tasks were preferred to explicit ones.Conclusion: This study highlighted that the use of VRT generated a competitive spirit in all participants.

Towards Maximum Energy Efficiency in Nanophotonic Interconnects with Thermal-Aware On-Chip Laser Tuning,"—Nanophotonic is an emerging technology considered as one of the key solutions for future generation on-chip interconnects. However, silicon photonic devices are highly sensitive to temperature variation. Under a given chip activity, this leads to a lower laser efficiency and a drift of wavelengths of optical devices (on-chip lasers and microring resonators (MRs)), which results in a higher Bit Error Ratio (BER). In this paper, we propose to jointly tune the on-chip lasers and and MRs in order to align the wavelengths of the emitted signals with the resonant wavelengths of the MRs. Our method allows significant improvements of the power consumption with regard to the related methods, while meeting the BER requirement. Compared to methods for which laser tuning is not possible, results show that a combined tuning of laser and MRs leads to 53% energy reduction when the uniform chip activity decreases from 20% to 5%. BER-energy tradeoffs have been explored and allow strategies to be defined to minimize either the energy, or the BER. As a key result, we have shown that, under specific chip activities, increasing the laser power consumption allows both energy and BER to be improved. This trend has been observed for a MWSR channel interconnecting 12 interfaces.",['info']
"Amino and nitro substituted 2-amino-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-diones: as versatile photo-initiators of polymerization: from violet-blue LEDs absorption to a panchromatic behavior","Four different 2-amino-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione derivatives (NDNs) bearing nitro- or amino- substituents have been prepared and incorporated into photoinitiating systems together with an iodonium salt, N-vinylcarbazole, an amine or 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine. The ring-opening cationic polymerization of epoxides as well as the free radical polymerization of acrylates upon exposure to various visible LEDs (e.g. LEDs at 405 nm, 455 nm or 470 nm) could be performed. Reactions under green or red light (e.g. laser diodes at 532 or 635 nm) are also feasible. Compared to the well-known camphorquinone-based systems, some of the novel NDN-based combinations employed here exhibit a much higher polymerization efficiency. A panchromatic behavior can also be observed with a specificallydesigned compound bearing two nitro groups (e.g. radical polymerization or thiol–ene processes can bepromoted upon blue, green or red light). This outstanding performance paves the way to polymerization under soft conditions. Their photochemical properties and structure/efficiency relationships have been investigated using steady state photolysis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, and electron spin resonance spin trapping techniques",['chim']
Dual activity of PNGM-1 pinpoints the evolutionary origin of subclass B3 metallo- β -lactamases: a molecular and evolutionary study,"Resistance to β-lactams is one of the most serious problems associated with Gram-negative infections. β-Lactamases are able to hydrolyze β-lactams such as cephalosporins and/or carbapenems. Evolutionary origin of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), conferring critical antibiotic resistance threats, remains unknown. We discovered PNGM-1, the novel subclass B3 MBL, in deep-sea sediments that predate the antibiotic era. Here, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that PNGM-1 yields insights into the evolutionary origin of subclass B3 MBLs. We reveal the structural similarities between tRNase Zs and PNGM-1, and demonstrate that PNGM-1 has both MBL and tRNase Z activities, suggesting that PNGM-1 is thought to have evolved from a tRNase Z. We also show kinetic and structural comparisons between PNGM-1 and other proteins including subclass B3 MBLs and tRNase Zs. These comparisons revealed that the B3 MBL activity of PNGM-1 is a promiscuous activity and subclass B3 MBLs are thought to have evolved through PNGM-1 activity.",['sdv']
Reliability and Performance Studies of DC-DC Conversion Powering Scheme for the CMS Pixel Tracker at SLHC,"The upgrades of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) introduce a significant challenge to the power distribution of the detectors. DC-DC conversion is the preferred powering scheme proposed to be integrated for the CMS tracker to deliver high input voltage levels and performing a step-down conversion nearby the detector modules. In this work, we propose a step-up/step-down powering scheme by performing voltage step up at the CAEN supply unit and voltage step down near the detector. We designed step-up converters and investigate the pixel performance and power loss on the FPIX power distribution system. Tests are performed using the PSI46 pixel readout chips on a forward pixel panel module and the DC-DC converters developed at CERN and Fermi- lab. Reliability studies include the voltage drop measurements on the readout chips and the power supply noise generated from the converter. Performance studies include pixel noise and threshold dispersion results. Comparison between step-down only and step-up/step-down conversion power- ing schemes are provided.","['info', 'spi']"
Enhancement of the ATLAS trigger system with a hardware tracker finder FTK,"The existing three-level ATLAS trigger system is deployed to reduce the event rate from the bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz to ~ 200 Hz for permanent storage at the LHC design luminosity of 1034 cm−2 s−1. When the LHC exceeds the design luminosity, the load on the Level-2 trigger system will significantly increase due both to the need for more sophisticated algorithms to suppress background and the larger event sizes. The Fast Tracker is a proposed upgrade to the current ATLAS trigger system that will operate at the full Level-1 accepted rate of 100 kHz and provide high quality tracks at the beginning of processing in the Level-2 trigger, by performing track reconstruction in hardware with massive parallelism of associative memories. The concept design is being advanced and justified with the performance in important physics areas, b-tagging, τ-tagging and lepton isolation. The prototyping with current technology is underway and R&D with new technologies has been started.","['info', 'spi']"
Gaussian process emulators for computer experiments with inequality constraints,"Physical phenomena are observed in many fields (sciences and engineering) and are often studied by time-consuming computer codes. These codes are analyzed with statistical models, often called emulators. In many situations, the physical system (computer model output) may be known to satisfy inequality constraints with respect to some or all input variables. Our aim is to build a model capable of incorporating both data interpolation and inequality constraints into a Gaussian process emulator. By using a functional decomposition, we propose to approximate the original Gaussian process by a finite-dimensional Gaussian process such that all conditional simulations satisfy the inequality constraints in the whole domain. The mean, mode (maximum a posteriori) and prediction intervals (uncertainty quantification) of the conditional Gaussian process are calculated. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, some conditional simulations with inequality constraints such as boundary, monotonicity or convexity conditions are given.",['math']
Thermoelastic Residual Stresses and Deformations at Laser Treatment,"A thermoelastic model implying relaxation of stresses at melting is applied for materials with arbitrary thermoelastic properties and the melting point. The range of Poisson's ratio 0.17 - 0.34 is numerically studied. The residual stresses are independent of the space scale. In narrow remelted zones and beads the maximum longitudinal tensile stress is approximately twice as high as the transverse one. The calculations predict cracking of alumina, even with 1600 oC preheating, plastic deformation or cracking of hard metal alloys H13 and TA6 V, and no destruction of polystyrene and thestrongest grades of quartz glass. The calculation results can be used for predicting the thermomechanical stability of materials at laser treatment.","['spi', 'phys']"
Beyond “Points of Control”: logics of digital governmentality,"In this paper, we aim to show the heuristic benefit of Michel Foucault’s concept of “governmentality”, in order to describe three logics of power and control within digital environments. These three logics – directing, constraining and framing online behaviours – are similar to Foucault’s approach to power, which is understood as a means to “lead other people’s behaviours”, as it is in this case enacted through the mediation of technical resources, such as software, algorithms and operating systems. This paper provides three illustrations of these logics of governmentality: the way in which Google tries to direct webmasters’ practices with the help of its SEO guidelines and a webmaster ranking system (governmentality by incentives); the way by which developers constrain online behaviours through websites and software (governmentality by design); the way Apple frames the work of app developers in order to institute specific standards for action and interaction within its iPhone operating system (governmentality by framing).",['shs']
Copper complexes: the effect of ligands on their photoinitiation efficiencies in radical polymerization reactions under visible light,"Twenty-three copper complexes (CuC) containing different ligands were synthesized. Most of them exhibited light absorption in the visible range (adapted to LEDs, laser diodes and halogen lamp exposure). The CuC/iodonium salt (Iod), CuC/Iod/N-vinylcarbazole, CuC/alkyl bromide/methyl diethanolamine photoinitiating systems (PISs) allow good monomer conversion profiles for the free radical polymerization of trimethylolpropane triacrylate. Some of them are better than bisacylphosphine oxide or camphorquinone based systems used as references. Real-Time Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and steady state photolysis were used as analytical methods. The results revealed that the ligands of the copper complexes played an important role towards the photoinitiation ability of these PISs. The use of CuC as photocatalysts to initiate thiol–ene reaction is also discussed",['chim']

Fundamental insights into the threshold characteristics of organic field-effect transistors,"We physically model the threshold characteristics of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) using a two-dimensional finite-element method. The transfer characteristics are simulated for staggered OFETs with various electronic structures. A reliable method to extract a structure-unique threshold voltage is presented based on the second-derivative method. By changing the hole injection barrier height in such a manner that the flat-band voltage, defined from the difference of Fermi levels of gate and source electrode, is kept constant, we demonstrate a direct impact of the hole injection barrier height on the threshold voltage. Simulated charge carrier distribution shows the two-dimensional nature of channel creation process and physical insights into the threshold characteristics of OFETs.","['spi', 'phys']"

Synergetic effect of the epoxide functional groups in the photocatalyzed atom transfer radical copolymerization of glycidyl methacrylate,"Methyl methacrylate (MMA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) were copolymerized by photocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization under the visible light irradiation of a compact blue LED lamp, using bis(1,10-phenanthroline)copper(I) as the photocatalyst. The polymerization was found to be all the more fast that the molar fraction of GMA was high. The same effect was observed when GMA was replaced by cyclohexene oxide (CHO) as a non-copolymerizable epoxide-containing compound. These results suggested that the epoxide functional group acted as a reducing agent in both cases, contributing to a faster regeneration of the activator form of the catalyst. This assumption was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy measurements, which evidenced a faster conversion of Cu(II) to Cu(I) in the presence of epoxide functional groups. Due to their large excess compared to the catalyst, no degradation of the epoxides was detected during the copolymerization of MMA and GMA, which thus provided well-defined poly(MMA-stat-GMA) copolymers as precursors for further functionalization. The statistical distribution of the epoxide side groups could also be controlled through sequenced additions of the comonomers, in a direct “one-pot” approach.",['chim']

"Millimeter‐Wave Outdoor‐to‐Indoor Channel Measurements at 3, 10, 17 and 60 GHz","Millimeter-Wave (mmW) communication systems, capable of achieving high data rates thanks to the large bandwidth available in this frequency range, are a promising 5G technology. Studies in this paper investigate the radio propagation channel at 3, 17 and 60 GHz in an Outdoor environment. Measurements were conducted using a wideband channel sounder to derive channel delay spread (DS). Results do not indicate a clear trend on the behavior of the DS with regards to the frequency. This disagrees in some way with the 3GPP TR 38.900 channel model findings which support a clear decreasing trend of this parameter as the frequency increases. At 60 GHz, the channel DS was computed with and without compensation of atmospheric oxygen absorption. It was found that this phenomenon has minor impact on the measurement results. Its compensation does not change the main conclusions.",['spi']
"Sequential gene expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and lung resistance protein: functional activity of P-gp and MRP present in the doxorubicin-resistant human K562 cell lines.","Previous studies have reported that P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transmembrane efflux pump involved in multidrug resistance (MDR), was overexpressed in the doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant human erythroleukemia cell line K562. Nevertheless, several results suggested that P-gp was not the only mechanism involved in these resistant cells. Sequential co-expression of other MDR-associated proteins was sometimes reported, as MDR-associated protein (MRP) and lung resistance protein (LRP), in different MDR cell lines. Thus, mRNA expression and stability of P-gp, MRP and LRP were analyzed, while their corresponding protein levels were quantified in correlation with functional assay, in the K562 cell line and two Dox-resistant variants (K562/R). Their P-gp content was in accordance with their degree of resistance, but not as much in the level of mRNA expression, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation. On the other hand, MRP could play a minor role in MDR because of an unchanged expression in K562/R sublines. A surprising progressive disappearance of LRP in both resistant cells suggested that the original mechanism of drug redistribution may be operative, involving a negative role for LRP.",['sdv']
Heart Failure Reviews Darwinian evolution and cardiovascular remodeling,"Mechanotransduction, MT, is an ancient evolutionary legacy existing in every living species and involving complex rearrangements of multiple proteins in response to a mechanical stress. MT includes three different interrelated processes: mechanosensation, mechanotransmission, and mechanoresponse. Each process is specifically adapted to a given tissue and stress. Both cardiac and arterial remodeling involve MT. Physiological or pathological cardiac remodeling, CR, is firstly a beneficial mechanoresponse, MR, which allows the heart to recover to a normal economy, better adapted to the new working conditions. Nevertheless, exercise-induced cardiac remodeling is more a coming-back to normal conditions than a superimposed event. On the longer term, the MR creates fibrosis which accounts, in part, for the reduced cardiac output in the CR. In the hypertension-induced arterial remodeling, arterial MR allows the vessels to maintain a normal circumferential constraint before an augmented arterial pressure. In atherogenesis: (i) The presence of atheroma in several animal species and atherosclerosis in ancient civilizations suggests more basic predispositions. (ii) The atherosclerotic plaques preferably develop at predictable arterial sites of disturbed blood flow showing that MT is involved in the initial steps of atherogenesis.",['sdv']
Morphological and Molecular Analysis Using RAPD in Biofield Treated Sponge and Bitter Gourd,"Plants are known to have sense and can respond to touch, electric and magnetic field. The present study was designed on the sponge gourd (Luffa cylindrica) and bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) seeds with respect to biofield energy treatment. The seeds of each crop were divided into two groups, one was kept control, while the other group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’ biofield energy treatment. The variabilities in growth contributing parameters were studied and compared with their control. To study the genetic variability after biofield energy treatment, both the seeds were analyzed for DNA fingerprinting using RAPD method. After germination, the plants of sponge gourd were reported to have uniform colored leaves and strong stem. The leaves and fruits of sponge gourd showed no infection, with anti-gravity properties during early stage of fruiting as compared with the control group. Similarly, treated bitter gourd showed uniform color of leaves, strong stem, with disease free fruits in biofield treated seeds as compared with the control. The true polymorphism (%) observed between control and treated samples of sponge and bottle gourd seed sample was an average value of 7.8% and 66% respectively. In conclusion, Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment has the ability to alter the plant growth rate that may by interacting with plant genome, which resulted in high yield of crops.",['sdv']
Analysis of Genetic Diversity Using Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) Markers and Growth Regulator Response in Biofield Treated Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.),"Cotton is the most important crop for the production of fiber that plays a key role in economic and social affairs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on cotton seeds regarding its growth, germination of seedling, glutathione (GSH) concentration, indole acetic acid (IAA) content and DNA fingerprinting using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for polymorphism analysis. The seeds of cotton cv. Stoneville-2 (Gossypium hirsutum L.) was obtained from DNA Land Marks Inc., Canada and divided into two groups. One group was remained as untreated, while the other was subjected to Mr. Trivedi biofield energy and referred as treated sample. The growth-germination of cotton seedling data showed higher germination (82%) in biofield treated seeds as compared to the control (68%). The alterations in length of shoot and root of cotton seedling was reported in the treated sample with respect to untreated seeds. However, the endogenous level of GSH in the leaves of treated cotton was increased by 27.68% as compared to the untreated sample, which may suggest an improved immunity of cotton plant. Further, the plant growth regulatory constituent i.e. IAA concentration was increased by 7.39%, as compared with the control. Besides, the DNA fingerprinting data, showed polymorphism (4%) between treated and untreated samples of cotton. The overall results suggest that the biofield energy treatment on cotton seeds, results in improved overall growth of plant, increase germination rate, GSH and IAA concentration were increased. The study assumed that biofield energy treatment on cotton seeds would be more useful for the production of cotton fiber.",['sdv']
Towards the Deployment of Machine Learning Solutions in Network Traffic Classification: A Systematic Survey,"Traffic analysis is a compound of strategies intended to find relationships, patterns, anomalies, and misconfigurations, among others things, in Internet traffic. In particular, traffic classification is a subgroup of strategies in this field that aims at identifying the application's name or type of Internet traffic. Nowadays, traffic classification has become a challenging task due to the rise of new technologies, such as traffic encryption and encapsulation, which decrease the performance of classical traffic classification strategies. Machine Learning gains interest as a new direction in this field, showing signs of future success, such as knowledge extraction from encrypted traffic, and more accurate Quality of Service management. Machine Learning is fast becoming a key tool to build traffic classification solutions in real network traffic scenarios; in this sense, the purpose of this investigation is to explore the elements that allow this technique to work in the traffic classification field. Therefore, a systematic review is introduced based on the steps to achieve traffic classification by using Machine Learning techniques. The main aim is to understand and to identify the procedures followed by the existing works to achieve their goals. As a result, this survey paper finds a set of trends derived from the analysis performed on this domain; in this manner, the authors expect to outline future directions for Machine Learning based traffic classification.",['info']

Weakly Supervised Learning of Deformable Part-Based Models for Object Detection via Region Proposals,"The success of deformable part-based models (DPMs) for visual object detection relies on a large number of labeled bounding boxes. With only image-level annotations, our goal is to propose a model enhancing the weakly supervised DPMs by emphasizing the importance of location and size of the initial class-specific root filter. To adaptively select a discriminative set of candidate bounding boxes as this root filter estimate, first, we explore the generic objectness measurement to combine the most salient regions and "" good "" region proposals. Second, we propose learning of the latent class label of each candidate window as a binary classification problem, by training category-specific classifiers used to coarsely classify a candidate window into either a target object or a nontarget class. Finally, we design a flexible enlarging-and-shrinking postprocessing procedure to modify the DPMs outputs, which can effectively match the approximative object aspect ratios and further improve final accuracy. Extensive experimental results on the challenging PASCAL Visual Object Class 2007 and the Microsoft Common Objects in Context 2014 dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework is effective for initialization of the DPM's root filter. It also shows competitive final localization performance with state-of-the-art weakly supervised object detection methods, particularly for the object categories that are relatively salient in the images and deformable in structures.

Spatio-temporal visualisation and data exploration of traditional ecological knowledge/indigenous knowledge,"Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) has been at the centre of mapping efforts for decades. Indigenous knowledge (IK) is a critical subset of TEK, and Indigenous peoples utilize a wide variety of techniques for keeping track of time. Although techniques for mapping and visualizing the temporal aspects of TEK/IK have been utilized, the spatio-temporal dimensions of TEK are not well explored visually outside of seasonal data and narrative approaches. Existing spatio-temporal models can add new visualization approaches for TEK but are limited by ontological constraints regarding time, particularly the poor support for multi-cyclical data and localized timing. For TEK to be well represented, flexible systems are needed for modelling and mapping time that correspond well with traditional conceptions of time being supported. These approaches can take cues from previous spatio-temporal visualization work in the GIS community, and from temporal depictions extant in existing cultural traditions.","['info', 'sde', 'shs']"
"François Place, Traveler of the Imaginary","The work of François Place is at the intersection of documentary and fiction, of historical or geographical reality and the imaginary. Traveler of time and space, the French artist has the gift of taking his readers of all ages through his lines, strokes, and colors into parallel universes. In turn, illustrator, author, and novelist, Place also has the genius of rethinking the very concept of children’s picture books. Born in 1957, to a schoolteacher mother and a mosaic artist father, François Place spent his childhood in Ezanville, a small town located about 20 kilometers north of Paris. He was eleven years old when the Place family moved to Touraine where his grandparents lived. François pursued his secondary studies at Tours. With a literary baccalaureate in hand, he left the Valley of the Loire in 1974, and undertook three years of advanced study in Paris, at the Ecole Estienne, a school of advanced studies for the arts and graphics industries. After graduation, he started out in business communication, publishing and advertising. In 1983, he began illustrating at Hachette, collaborating on the “Bibliothèque Rose” collection, where he participated in republishing the works of the Countess of Ségur. For Hachette Jeunesse always and for “Le Livre de Poche” collection, he worked with Henriette Bichonnier and Roselyne Morel. In 1985, he met Pierre Marchand, editor at Gallimard Jeunesse, who noticed his drawings for youth. His career as an illustrator seemed to skyrocket from this point. Gallimard entrusted him with the illustration of a series of five documentaries for the “Découverte Cadet” collection, having as a subject the discovery of the world, the great conquerors, explorers and navigators.",['shs']
"A comprehensive physicochemical, thermal, and spectroscopic characterization of zinc (II) chloride using X-ray diffraction, particle size distribution, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermogravimetric analysis, ultraviolet-visible, and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy","Objective: Zinc chloride is an important inorganic compound used as a source of zinc and has other numerous industrial applications. Unfortunately, it lacks reliable and accurate physicochemical, thermal, and spectral characterization information altogether. Hence, the authors tried to explore in-depth characterization of zinc chloride using the modern analytical technique. Materials and Methods: The analysis of zinc chloride was performed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), particle size distribution, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) analytical techniques. Results: The PXRD patterns showed well-defined, narrow, sharp, and the significant peaks. The crystallite size was found in the range of 14.70–55.40 nm and showed average crystallite size of 41.34 nm. The average particle size was found to be of 1.123 (d10), 3.025 (d50), and 6.712 (d90) µm and average surface area of 2.71 m2/g. The span and relative span values were 5.849 µm and 1.93, respectively. The DSC thermogram showed a small endothermic inflation at 308.10°C with the latent heat (∆H) of fusion 28.52 J/g. An exothermic reaction was observed at 449.32°C with the ∆H of decomposition 66.10 J/g. The TGA revealed two steps of the thermal degradation and lost 8.207 and 89.72% of weight in the first and second step of degradation, respectively. Similarly, the DTG analysis disclosed Tmax at 508.21°C. The UV-vis spectrum showed absorbance maxima at 197.60 nm (λmax), and FT-IR spectrum showed a peak at 511/cm might be due to the Zn–Cl stretching. Conclusions: These in-depth, comprehensive data would be very much useful in all stages of nutraceuticals/pharmaceuticals formulation research and development and other industrial applications.",['sdv']
Reducing Retrieval Time in Automated Storage and Retrieval System with a Gravitational Conveyor Based on Multi-Agent Systems,"The main objective of this study is to reduce the retrieval time of a list of products by choosing the best combination of storage and retrieval rules at any time. This is why we start by implementing some storage rules in an Automated Storage/Retrieval System (Automated Storage and Retrieval System: AS/RS) fitted with a gravity conveyor while some of these rules are dedicated to storage and others to retrieval. The system is seen as a Multi-Agent System (MAS) where the produced agents are reactive agents that can interact to achieve a behavior (organizing the store). Our MAS is characterized by a decentralized control, which means that there is no preset plan. The produced agents exchange information such as their color, their distance from the output station, etc. Each product merely applies a set of behavioral rules. The aim is to choose the best product to be retrieved in the shortest possible time. The product-type agents have no cognitive ability, but still perform complex tasks.",['spi']
Evaluation of Phenotyping and Genotyping Characterization of Serratia marcescens after Biofield Treatment,"Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) is Gram-negative bacterium, associated with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), especially urinary tract and wound infections. The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on phenotyping and genotyping characteristics such as antimicrobial susceptibility, biochemical reactions, biotype, DNA polymorphism, and phylogenetic relationship of S. marcescens (ATCC 13880). The lyophilized cells of S. marcescens were divided into three groups (G1, G2, and G3). Control group (G1) and treated groups (G2 and G3) of S. Marcescens cells assessed with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility, and biochemical reactions. In addition to that, samples from different groups of S. marcescens were evaluated for DNA polymorphism by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and 16S rDNA sequencing in order to establish the phylogenetic relationship of S. marcescens with different bacterial species. The treated cells of S. marcescens showed an alteration of 10.34% and 34.48% antimicrobials in G2 and G3 on 10th day, respectively as compared to control. The significant changes of biochemical reactions were also observed in treated groups of S. marcescens. The RAPD data showed an average range of 16-49.2% of polymorphism in treated samples as compared to control. Based on nucleotide homology sequences and phylogenetic analysis, the nearest homolog genus-species was found to be Pseudomonas fluorescence. These findings suggest that biofield treatment can prevent the emergence of absolute resistance to the useful antimicrobials against S. Marcescens.",['sdv']
General existence of competitive equilibrium in the growth model with an endogenous labor-leisure choice,"We prove the existence of competitive equilibrium in the canonical optimal growth model with elastic labor supply under general conditions. In this model, strong conditions to rule out corner solutions are often not well justied. We show using a separation argument that there exist Lagrange multipliers that can be viewed as a system of competitive prices. Neither Inada conditions, nor strict concavity, nor homogeneity, nor dierentiability are required for existence of a competitive equilibrium. Thus, we cover important specications used in the macroeconomics literature for which existence of a competitive equilibrium is not well understood. We give examples to illustrate the violation of the conditions used in earlier existence results but where a competitive equilibrium can be shown to exist following the approach in this paper.",['shs']

In combination with additives (e.g., iodonium salt, N-vinylcarbazole, amine, or chloro triazine), the FeC-based systems are able to efficiently generate radicals, cations, and radical cations on a near UV or visible light-emitting diode (LED) exposure. These systems are characterized by an unprecedented reactivity, that is, for very low content 0.02% FeC-based systems is still highly efficient in photopolymerization contrary to the most famous reference systems (Bisacylphosphine oxide) illustrating the performance of the proposed catalytic approach. This work paves the way for polymerization in soft conditions (e.g., on LED irradiation). These FeC-based systems exhibit photocatalytic properties, undergo the formation of radicals, radical cations, and cations and can operate through oxidation or/and reduction cycles. The photochemical mechanisms for the formation of the initiating species are studied using steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, electron spin resonance spin trapping, and laser flash photolysis techniques.",['chim']

Naphthalic anhydride derivatives: structural effects on their initiating abilities in radical and/or cationic photopolymerizations under visible light,"Only one naphthalic anhydride derivative has been reported as light sensitive photoinitiator, this prompted us to further explore the possibility to prepare a new family of photoinitiators based on this scaffold. Therefore, eight naphthalic Naphthalic anhydride derivatives (ANH1-ANH8) have been prepared and combined with an iodonium salt (and optionally N-vinylcarbazole) or an amine (and optionally 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine) to initiate the cationic polymerization of epoxides and the free radical polymerization of acrylates under different irradiation sources, that is, very soft halogen lamp (∼ 12 mW cm−2), laser diode at 405 nm (∼1.5 mW cm−2) or blue LED centered at 455 nm (80 mW cm−2). The ANH6 based photoinitiating systems are particularly efficient for the cationic and the radical photopolymerizations, and even better than that of the well-known camphorquinone based systems. The photochemical mechanisms associated with the chemical structure/photopolymerization efficiency relationships are studied by steady state photolysis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, and electron spin resonance spin-trapping techniques.",['chim']
"Novel panchromatic photopolymerizable matrices: N,N'-dibutylquinacridone as an efficient and versatile photoinitiator","N,N'-dibutylquinacridone (DBQA) is utilized here for the first time as a high-performance panchromatic photoinitiator for the cationic polymerization (CP) of epoxides, the free radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylates, the thiol-ene polymerization and the synthesis of interpenetrated polymer networks (epoxide/acrylate) under violet, blue, green and yellow lights (emitted from LED at 405 nm, 470 nm, 520 nm, or 594 nm, or laser diode at 532 nm). It confers a panchromatic character to the photopolymerizable matrices. Remarkably, the proposed DBQA based photoinitiating systems exhibit quite excellent efficiency (the final monomer conversion for multifunctional monomers at room temperature can reach 62% and 50% in CP and FRP, respectively) and appear as much more powerful than the camphorquinone or Eosin-Y containing reference systems for visible light. For green light, DBQA is much more reactive than the literature reference (Eosin-Y) and for blue light, a good reactivity is found compared with camphorquinone. The photochemical mechanisms are studied by molecular orbital calculations, steady state photolysis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, and electron spin resonance spin trapping techniques.",['chim']
Structure/reactivity/photoinitiation ability relationships in novel benzo pyrazolo (or imidazo) isoquinolinone derivatives upon visible light LEDs,"Isoquinolinone derivatives bearing amino- or nitro- substituent (IQNs) have been synthesized as photoinitiators and combined with various additives (i.e., iodonium salt, N-vinylcarbazole, amine or 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)−1,3,5-triazine) to initiate ring-opening cationic polymerizations (CP) or free radical polymerizations under exposure to visible LEDs (e.g., LEDs at 405 nm or 455 nm, or cold white LED) or a halogen lamp. Compared to the well-known camphorquinone-based systems, the novel IQNs-based combinations employed here demonstrate higher efficiencies for the CP of epoxides. The photochemically generated reactive species (i.e., cations and radicals) from the IQNs-based systems have been investigated by steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, fluorescence, laser flash photolysis, and electron spin resonance spin trapping techniques. The structure/reactivity/photoinitiating ability relationships of IQNs-based combinations are also discussed; the crucial role of the excited state lifetimes of the photoinitiators to ensure efficient quenching by additives is clearly underlined",['chim']
A benzophenone-naphthalimide derivative as versatile photoinitiator for near UV and visible lights,"A benzophenone-naphthalimide derivative (BPND) bearing tertiary amine groups has been developed as a high-performance photoinitiator in combination with 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine or an iodonium salt for both the tree radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylates and the cationic polymerization (CP) of epoxides upon exposure to near UV and visible LEDs (385–470 nm). BPND can even produce radicals without any added hydrogen donor. The photochemical mechanisms are studied by molecular orbital calculations, steady state photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry and laser flash photolysis techniques. These novel BPND based photoinitiating systems exhibit an efficiency higher than that of the well-known camphorquinone- based systems (FRP and CP) or comparable to that of bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide (FRP at 455 nm).",['chim']
The Discursive Effects of the Haiku-based SADUPA Poetry Technique in Palliative Care,"This qualitative study seeks to present the discursive effects of SADUPA, a new poetry-based technique centered on haiku, in the context of psycho-oncological treatment.

Copper and iron complexes as visible-light-sensitive photoinitiators of polymerization,"The utilization of visible lights for the fabrication of polymeric materials is recognized as a promising and environmentally friendly approach. This process relies on the photochemical generation of reactive species (e.g., radicals, radical cations, or cations) from well-designed photoinitiators (PIs) or photoinitiating systems (PISs) to initiate the polymerization reactions of different monomers (acrylates, methacrylates, epoxides, and vinyl ethers). In spite of the fact that metal complexes such as ruthenium- or iridium-based complexes have found applications in organic and polymer synthesis, the search of other low-cost metal-based complexes as PISs is emerging and attracting increasing attentions. Particularly, the concept of the photoredox catalysis has appeared recently as a unique tool for polymer synthesis upon soft conditions (use of light emitting diodes and household lamp). This highlight focuses on recently designed copper and iron complexes as PI catalysts in the application of photoinduced polymerizations (radical, cationic, interpenetrated polymer networks, and thiol-ene) or controlled radical polymerization under visible light irradiation",['chim']
Visible-light-sensitive photoredox catalysis by iron complexes: applications in cationic and radical polymerization reactions,"The development of iron complexes for the photoredox catalysis is a huge challenge. Indeed, Iron complexes can be ideal candidates due to their potential visible light absorption and redox properties but also because they are less toxic, inexpensive and environmentally friendly compared to other catalysts. In the present paper, a series of novel iron complexes have been synthesized and utilized to initiate the free radical promoted cationic polymerization of epoxides or the free radical polymerization of acrylates through photoredox catalysis processes upon exposure to near UV (385 nm) or visible violet (405 nm) light emitting diodes (LEDs). When combined with an iodonium salt and N-vinylcarbazole, the iron complex-based photoinitiating systems are able to generate radicals, cations, and radical cations. The initiation efficiency is investigated through real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and a satisfactory initiating ability is found. The mechanisms for the generation of the reactive initiating species through photoredox catalysis are studied by different methods (steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry and electron spin resonance spin trapping techniques) and discussed in detail",['chim']
Naphthalimide-phthalimide derivative based photoinitiating systems for polymerization reactions under blue lights,"Naphthalimide-phthalimide derivatives (NDPDs) have been synthesized and combined with an iodonium salt, N-vinylcarbazole, amine or 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine to produce reactive species (i.e., radicals and cations). These generated reactive species are capable of initiating the cationic polymerization of epoxides and/or the radical polymerization of acrylates upon exposure to very soft polychromatic visible lights or blue lights. Compared with the well-known camphorquinone based systems used as references, the novel NDPD based combinations employed here demonstrate clearly higher efficiencies for the cationic polymerization of epoxides under air as well as the radical polymerization of acrylates. Remarkably, one of the NDPDs (i.e., NDPD2) based systems is characterized by an outstanding reactivity. The structure/reactivity/efficiency relationships of the investigated NDPDs were studied by fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, and steady state photolysis techniques. The key parameters for their reactivity are provided.",['chim']
Aminothiazonaphthalic anhydride derivatives as photoinitiators for violet/ blue LED-induced cationic and radical photopolymerizations and 3D-printing resins,"The cations and radicals produced in aminothiazonaphthalic anhydride derivatives (ATNAs) combined with an iodonium salt, N-vinylcarbazole, amine, or chloro triazine initiate the ring-opening cationic polymerization of epoxides and the free radical polymerization of acrylates under LEDs at 405 or 455 nm. The photoinitiating ability of these novel photoinitiating systems is higher than that of the well-known camphorquinone-based systems. An example of the high reactivity of the new proposed photoinitiator is also provided in resins for 3D-printing using a LED projector@405 nm.

"Interpreting palaeofire evidence from fluvial sediments: a case study from Santa Rosa Island, California, with implications for the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis","Fluvial sequences from the late Pleistocene to the Holocene are exposed in Arlington Canyon, Santa Rosa Island, Northern Channel Islands, California, USA, including one outcrop that features centrally in the controversial hypothesis of an extra-terrestrial impact at the onset of the Younger Dryas. The fluvial sequence in Arlington Canyon contains a significant quantity and range of organic material, much of which has been charred. The purpose of this study was to systematically describe the key outcrop of the Arlington sequence, provide new radiocarbon age control and analyse organic material in the Arlington sediments within a rigorous palaeobotanical and palaeo-charcoal context. These analyses provide a test of previous claims for catastrophic impact-induced fire in Arlington Canyon. Carbonaceous spherular materials were identified as predominantly fungal sclerotia; ‘carbon elongates’ are predominantly arthropod coprolites, including termite frass. ‘Glassy carbon’ formed from the precipitation of tars during charcoalification. None of these materials indicate high-temperature formation or combustion. Charcoal and other materials in Arlington Canyon document widespread and frequent fires both before and after the onset of the Younger Dryas, recording predominantly low-temperature surface fires. In summary, we find no evidence in Arlington Canyon for an extra-terrestrial impact or catastrophic impact-induced fire.",['sde']
"Dislocation Core Structure at Finite Temperature Inferred by Molecular Dynamics Simulations for 1,3,5-Triamino-2,4,6- trinitrobenzene Single Crystal","The dislocation core structures and elastic properties of the insensitive energetic molecular crystal 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) are investigated as a function of pressure and temperature. A new method is proposed to compute the generalized stacking fault surfaces (noted γ-surfaces) and the complete second-order elastic tensor at finite temperature through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The energy landscapes in the two glide planes are shown to be similar between 0 and 300 K, thus leading to almost no modification on the dislocation evolution. A spreading of the dislocation cores over a hundred Burgers vectors is observed along the [100] and [010] directions for the edge and screw dislocations at 0 and 300 K, showing that dislocations should exhibit a very low friction for these glide systems at ambient pressure. For pressures varying between 0 and 10 GPa, the γ-surfaces' energy barriers that drive the width of partial dislocations follow the increase of shear elastic constants within the considered glide planes, thus limiting the changes of the dislocation core structure.","['chim', 'phys']"

"Prediction of the moments in advection-diffusion lattice Boltzmann method. I. Truncation dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis","The effect of the heterogeneity in the soil structure or the nonuniformity of the velocity field on the modeled resident time distribution (RTD) and breakthrough curves is quantified by their moments. While the first moment provides the effective velocity, the second moment is related to the longitudinal dispersion coefficient ( k T )in the developed Taylor regime; the third and fourth moments are characterized by their normalized values skewness (Sk) and kurtosis (Ku), respectively. The purpose of this investigation is to examine the role of the truncation corrections of the numerical scheme in k T, Sk, and Ku because of their interference with the second moment, in the form of the numerical dispersion, and in the higher-order moments, by their definition. Our symbolic procedure is based on the recently proposed extended method of moments (EMM). Originally, the EMM restores any-order physical mo- ments of the RTD or averaged distributions assuming that the solute concentration obeys the advection-diffusion equation in multidimensional steady-state velocity field, in streamwise-periodic heterogeneous structure. In our work, the EMM is generalized to the fourth-order-accurate apparent mass-conservation equation in two- and three-dimensional duct flows. The method looks for the solution of the transport equation as the product of a long harmonic wave and a spatially periodic oscillating component; the moments of the given numerical scheme are derived from a chain of the steady-state fourth-order equations at a single cell. This mathematical technique is exemplified for the truncation terms of the two-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann scheme, using plug and parabolic flow in straight channel and cylindrical capillary with the d2Q9 and d3Q15 discrete velocity sets as simple but illustrative examples. The derived symbolic dependencies can be readily extended for advection by another, Newtonian or non-Newtonian, flow profile in any-shape open-tabular conduits. It is established that the truncation errors in the three transport coefficients k T , Sk, and Ku decay with the second-order accuracy. While the physical values of the three transport coefficients are set by Peclet number, their truncation corrections additionally depend on the two adjustable relaxation rates and the two adjustable equilibrium weight families which independently determine the convective and diffusion discretization stencils. We identify flow- and dimension-independent optimal strategies for adjustable parameters and confront them to stability requirements. Through specific choices of two relaxation rates and weights, we expect our results be directly applicable to forward-time central differences and leap-frog central-convective Du Fort-Frankel-diffusion schemes. In straight channel, a quasi-exact validation of the truncation predictions through the numerical moments becomes possible thanks to the specular-forward no-flux boundary rule. In the staircase description of a cylindrical capillary, we account for the spurious boundary- layer diffusion and dispersion because of the tangential constraint of the bounce-back no-flux boundary rule.",['sde']

Twenty-One Things to Do with Scratch in the Twenty-First Century Classroom,"Globally, programming education for children is receiving widespread attention as a part of twenty-first century skills. Learning programming is not just about learning to code, but it also helps children learn how to learn. However, unlike traditional classes where students mostly learn from teachers’ teaching, learning through programing (in a broad sense, “making”) needs to be approached differently. To make programming education more successful in elementary school classrooms, students must be self-learners, and moreover, teachers need to encourage students to be self-learners by acting as facilitators, mentors, or peers (and occasionally as teachers). Classrooms have many physical limitations, and school curricula, especially elementary school curricula, have even more limitations, such as time and subjects. How can we introduce programming and making to twenty-first century classrooms? Upon its publication, “Twenty things to do with a computer” (Papert & Solomon 1971) impacted both teachers and researchers. In this paper, I will share twenty-one things that I have been doing with Scratch and the tiny programmable computer “Cricket,” invented by MIT Media Lab, in Japanese elementary school classrooms to maximize students’ learning through making, in over 700 hours of classes for 15 years.",['info']

Le célibat des agriculteurs: unité et diversité,"Le célibat en milieu agricole prend une actualité nouvelle avec le succès d'émissions de téléréalité telles que « L'amour est dans le pré ». L'intimité et la difficulté à vivre sans conjoint vécues par certains agriculteurs sont affichées, exposées aux yeux du grand public. Une partie de la profession agricole lance des initiatives pour y remédier (comme avec l'Agri-dating de Laissac en septembre 2011 organisée par les JA d'Aveyron).Le célibat devient donc visible médiatiquement à un moment historique où la situation de vie seule s'est banalisée (Toulemon, Pennec, 2011).Dans les années 60, le modèle du mariage est dominant et le célibat une situation stigmatisée.Il est le fait des « vieilles filles » et des « vieux garçons », il est synonyme de non-passage à la vie adulte et, partant,il reste le lot des personnes déclassées. Avec la baisse du nombre de mariages et la moindre prégnance du modèle matrimonial, le célibat se complexifie et prend un double sens : il peut correspondre à une situation de misère sexuelle et affective mais peut aussi être revendiqué comme une situation choisie, assumée, qui offre une certaine liberté (Singly, 1991), une situation propice à la multiplication des contacts sociaux, de la sociabilité amicale (Kaufmann, 1994). Le célibat en agriculture prend une dimension particulière dans la mesure où la transmission des exploitations d'une génération à une autre est un horizon central dans ce milieu (Cardon, 2004, Bessière, 2010). L'agriculture a longtemps été pensée selon la figure d'un « métier de couple ». Le célibat dans ce contexte a donc signé un double échec dans la reproduction au quotidien comme à plus long terme de l'exploitation (Bourdieu, 2002). C'est par rapport à cette question de la reproduction de l'agriculture que nous souhaitons apporter un nouvel éclairage : où en est-on du célibat en milieu agricole aujourd'hui ?",['shs']

"Evaluation of Atomic, Physical and Thermal Properties of Tellurium Powder: Impact of Biofield Energy Treatment","Tellurium has gained significant attention due to its photoconductivity, piezoelectricity, and thermo conductivity properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of biofield energy treatment on thermal, physical and atomic properties of tellurium powder. The tellurium powder was equally divided in two parts: control and treated (T). The treated part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment, whereas the control part was remained untreated. Subsequently, the control and treated samples were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The DSC data showed that latent heat of fusion was decreased by 14.13, 21.90, and 5.55% in treated samples T1, T2, and T3, respectively as compared to the control. However, the melting temperature did not show any change in treated samples as compared to the control. The TGA data showed that the peak width (difference in onset and endset) was increased from 213.67°C (control) to 234.82°C in treated tellurium sample. Besides, XRD results exhibited an alteration in lattice parameter, unit cell volume, density, atomic weight and nuclear charge volume of the treated tellurium powder as compared to the control. In addition, the crystallite sizes were significantly changed on crystalline plane (102) and (110) as 146.05→48.67 nm and 63.01→88.21 nm, respectively in the treated tellurium. The FT-IR spectra did not show any significant change in absorption frequencies in treated sample as compared to the control. Therefore, DSC, TGA and XRD data suggested that Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment has significantly altered the thermal and physical properties of tellurium powder. Thus, biofield energy treatment could be applied to modulate the thermal and physical properties in semiconductor and chalcogenide glass industries.",['phys']

Model of realism score for immersive VR systems,"A model of a realism score for immersive virtual reality and driving simulators is presented. First, we give an outlook of the different definitions of what ‘‘realism” is and the different approaches that exist in the literature to objectively quantify it. Then, we present the method, the theoretical development of the score and the results proposed. This realism score system aims to objectively quantify the characteristics of the visual perception happening for a perfect (non-altered vision) observer when experiencing an immersive VR system, as compared to the human visual system in a real (non-VR) situation. It addresses not only the visual perception but also the immersivity of the experience. The approach is different from the signal detection theory and the quantum efficiency theory that both rely on probabilities computation. It is made of several items, graded between 0 and 100, and divided in two sections: vision cues and immersion cues. These items represent, and are based on, the different skills of the human visual system. Realism score could be used as a helping tool in many applications such as objectively grading the performance of a VR system, defining the specifications of a new display, or choosing a simulator between several others available for a given experiment.",['info']

Measuring Unilateral Effects under Data Scarcity: A Merger Case in South Africa,"In this paper, we use a differentiated-products setup to assess the impact on competition of a merger between Greif and Rheem South Africa. Both parties are active in the industrial packaging products sector. The parties’ activities overlap, among others, in the production of large steel drums. Our analysis suggests that there is a low degree of substitutability between large steel drums and other products in the market. For this reason, we focus our competitive assessment on the unilateral effects of large steel drums. We rely on a limited amount of relatively high-level data to arrive to robust conclusions on the unilateral effects that the merger would induce. We study these unilateral effects using two empirical tools, the upward pricing pressure (UPP) and the gross upward pricing pressure index (GUPPI). These two measures are complementary in assessing the competitive harm that the merger could induce. UPP nets out the incentive to raise prices due to lower competition with the incentive to reduce prices due to lower marginal costs. GUPPI focuses on the incentive to raise prices post-merger and is linked to the market definition that competition authorities use when defining the relevant market. To our knowledge, this paper provides the first application in the African continent of such empirical analysis. We calculate these two measures following the conclusion of the Tribunal. We conclude that both UPP and GUPPI consistently signal that the merger would create strong incentives to raise prices.Dans cet article, nous utilisons une configuration de produits différenciés pour évaluer l’impact sur la concurrence d’une fusion entre Greif et Rheem Afrique du Sud. Les deux parties sont actives dans le secteur des produits d’emballage industriel. Les activités des parties se chevauchent, entre autres, dans la production de grands fûts en acier. Notre analyse suggère qu’il y a un faible degré de substituabilité entre les grands fûts en acier et les autres produits sur le marché. C’est pourquoi nous axons notre appréciation concurrentielle sur les effets unilatéraux des grands fûts en acier. Nous nous appuyons sur un nombre limité de données relativement élevées pour parvenir à des conclusions solides sur les effets unilatéraux que la concentration induirait. Nous étudions ces effets unilatéraux à l’aide de deux outils empiriques, la pression à la hausse sur les prix (UPP) et l’indice brut de pression à la hausse sur les prix (GUPPI). Ces deux mesures sont complémentaires pour évaluer le préjudice concurrentiel que la fusion pourrait induire. L’UPP nettoie l’incitation à augmenter les prix en raison d’une concurrence moindre avec l’incitation à réduire les prix en raison de coûts marginaux plus faibles. Le GUPPI se concentre sur l’incitation à augmenter les prix après la fusion et est lié à la définition du marché que les autorités de la concurrence utilisent pour définir le marché en cause.

A role-based collaborative process design on crowdsourcing systemsEin rollenbasiertes kollaboratives Prozessdesign für Crowdsourcing-SystemeUne conception rôle-centrée de processus collaboratif pour systèmes de crowdsourcing,"Crowdsourcing is a collaborative business process model, in which tasks are carried out by a crowd. In crowdsourcing systems, there are two types of stakeholders namely, requesters who outsources tasks, and the crowd or contributors, performing those tasks. We consider a stakeholder as an actor or a standalone software component, evolving on a platform and having both mechanisms of interaction with its environment and business skills. A set of stakeholders interacting in a dynamic context for solving a problem, is a distributed collaborative system, and we term it crowsourcing system. In such a system, the role concept is central, because each stakeholder must have a specific framework within which he collaborate. Traditionally, collaborative systems lose flexibility if their design is role-based, because only static role description mechanisms based on intuitive concepts are available. We propose in this paper, an improvement consisting of four things: (1)defining clearly what an outsourceable task or crowd task is, (2)specifying roles clearly and rigorously, while ensuring flexibility for collaboration, (3)providing role switching mechanisms and, (4) providing an abstract basis, for crowdsourcing system design and workflow monitoring and checking mechanisms, for potential activities, dynamically carried out by a system.Le crowdsourcing est un modèle de processus métier collaboratif, dans lequel les tâches sont externalisées. Dans ces systèmes, on distingue deux types d'intervenants: les demandeurs qui externalisent des t\^{a}ches et la foule ou contributeurs qui effectuent ces tâches. Nous considérons un intervenant à la fois comme un acteur et un composant logiciel autonome, évoluant sur une plateforme, disposant de mécanismes d'interaction avec son environnement et de compétences m\'{e}tiers. Un ensemble d'intervenants interagissant dans un contexte dynamique pour résoudre un problème, est un système collaboratif distribué,désigné par système de crowdsourcing. Dans un tel système, le concept de rôle est central, car chaque intervenant doit disposer d'un cadre spécifique dans lequel il collabore. Traditionnellement, les systèmes collaboratifs perdent en flexibilité si leur conception est rôle-centrée, car seuls les mécanismes statiques de description de rôles, basés sur des concepts intuitifs sont disponibles. Nous proposons dans cet article, une amélioration consistant en quatre choses: (1)définir clairement ce qu'est une tâche externalisable, (2)spécifier les rôles clairement et rigoureusement, tout en assurant la flexibilité de la collaboration, (3) fournir des mécanismes de changement de rôle et, (4) fournir une base abstraite, pour la conception de systèmes de crowdsourcing et les mécanismes de monitoring et de vérification de workflows, pour les activités menées dynamiquement par un système.",['info']

Decision Support Methodology for Designing Efficient and Sustainable Recycling Pathways,"As the end of life becoming more and more complex recycling systems encountered many difficulties in valuing all the materials contain in each product. This involves not only recovering a large number of materials but also doing so with the minimal environmental impact. Although the benefits of recycling are well established, the industrial processes need to be designed in regard with their environmental impacts. That why recyclers need robust assessment tools to make the right choices during the design of recycling processes. This evaluation work should enable them to choose the right recycling solutions for a wide range of end of life products. In this article, we present how we develop a methodology for evaluating the performance of recycling processes during their design phase. This methodology is our answer to help optimise the recycling of multi materials products based on the evaluation of the sustainability performance of the processes chosen.",['sde']
A Computational Cognition and Visual Servoing Based Methodology to Design Automatic Manipulative Tasks,"In the last decades, robotics has exerted an important role in the research on diverse knowledge domains, such as, artificial intelligence, biology, neuroscience and psychology. In particular, the study of knowledge representation and thinking, has led to the proposal of cognitive architectures; capturing essential structures and processes of cognition and behavior. Robotists have also attempted to design automatic systems using these proposals. Though, certain difficulties have been reported for obtaining efficient low-level processing while sensing or controlling the robot. The main challenges involve the treatment of the differences between the computational paradigms employed by the cognitive and the robotic architectures. The objective of this work, is to propose a methodology for designing robotic systems capable of decision making and learning when executing manipulative tasks. The development of a system called the Cognitive Reaching Robot (CRR) will be reported. CRR combines the advantages of using a psychologically-oriented cognitive architecture, with efficient low-level behavior implementations through the visual servoing control technique.","['info', 'spi']"
Cognitive Modeling for Automating Learning in Visually-guided Manipulative Tasks,"Robot manipulators, as general-purpose machines, can be used to perform various tasks. Though, adaptations to specific scenarios require of some technical efforts. In particular, the descriptions of the task result in a robot program which must be modified whenever changes are introduced. Another source of variations are undesired changes due to the entropic properties of systems; in effect, robots must be re-calibrated with certain frequency to produce the desired results. To ensure adaptability , cognitive robotists aim to design systems capable of learning and decision making. Moreover, control techniques such as visual-servoing allow robust control under inaccuracies in the estimates of the system's parameters. This paper reports the design of a platform called CRR, which combines the computational cognition paradigm for decision making and learning, with the visual-servoing control technique for the automation of manipulative tasks.","['info', 'spi']"

X-rays preconditioning effects on the induced refractive index change in femtosecond laser fabrication of embedded waveguides in silica glasses,"The fs-laser induced modification of the refractive index was investigated for pure fused silica (Corning 7980) under X-ray preconditioning (20-100 keV). Three samples have been pre-irradiated with different accumulated doses of 0.5 MGy (SiO2), 1 MGy, 6 MGy and one kept as a reference. Waveguides have been inscribed in all these samples varying the pulse energy and scan speed. The X-ray treatment influence on the refractive index change (∆n) was investigated through the estimation of the numerical aperture (NA) of the written waveguides. Results show that ∆n is higher in the pre-irradiated samples with Xrays compared with the untreated one. As a consequence, the photoinscription efficiency increases and the pretreatment can be considered as an option for high contrast low loss index modifications.",['phys']

Using temporary pastures to enhance soil fertility,"The definition of soil fertility has shifted through time; it is currently based on the idea of functional components that are chemical, biological, and physical in nature. According to this modern definition, a soil's organic matter content is a key component of its fertility, and soil microorganisms play a major role in releasing minerals that crops can use to meet their needs. As efforts are made to increase the sustainability of crop systems, incorporating temporary and/or artificial pastures into the rotation cycle may help increase crop yields in the short term. It can also change the levels and/or qualify of soil organic matter and, in the intermediate term, influence a soil's biological properties.",['sdv']

Chromatin dynamics and Polycomb regulation in Arabidopsis,"In eukaryotes, cell-fate determination, differentiation and developmental programs require precise spatial and temporal control of gene expression. Balance between gene activation and repression as well as mechanisms of maintenance and erasure of expression patterns are required for a fine gene tuning. This is achieved by highly dynamic changes of the chromatin conformation based on DNA methylation, biochemical and biophysical properties of the nucleosomes (i.e. histone post-translational modifications, histones variants) and large chromatin-related protein complexes. For instance, Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and thithorax (Trx) proteins are key transcriptional regulators in these regulatory mechanisms, that establish silent and active chromatin states, respectively, and perpetuate epigenetic states through cell divisions. I will briefly review chromatin dynamics by using the epigenetic regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS C, a floral transcriptional regulator, as a model. Then, I will discuss Polycomb regulation in plants.",['sdv']

Web 2.0,"In 2001, the bursting of the dot-com bubble led some analysts to argue that the World Wide Web was overhyped. A few years later, in a brainstorming session to organize a conference in the fall of 2004, technology publisher Tim O'Reilly and web pioneer Dale Dougherty noted that the organizations and companies that survived the crash were more important than ever and that they shared similar business models, design, and development patterns. The term Web 2.0 was adopted to describe the emergent physiognomy of the web and to name the upcoming conference. The term Web 2.0 has been criticized as being a marketing buzzword and as promoting the idea of a technological revolution that did not happened, but O'Reilly and Dougherty's analysis behind the term was indeed about the market and the economy, and about a ""natural selection"" among existing models rather than a tabula rasa revolution. To clarify his thoughts, in 2005 O'Reilly published the seminal article ""What is Web 2.0"". This entry explores the characteristics drawn by O'Reilly of Web 2.0 phenomenon, how most of them succeeded in changing the way contents and software are produced , how a few others failed, and the societal implications of both of these success and failures. It then discusses if the Semantic Web, sometimes called ""Web 3.0"", can be considered as the successor of Web 2.0.","['scco', 'info']"

Food price volatility and domestic stabilization policies in developing countries,"When food prices spike in countries with large numbers of poor people, hunger and malnutrition are very likely to result in the absence of public intervention. For governments, this is also a case of political survival. Government actions often take the form of direct interventions in the market to stabilize food prices, which goes against most international advice to rely on safety nets and world trade. Despite the limitations of food price stabilization policies, they are widespread in developing countries. This paper attempts to untangle the elements of this policy conundrum. Price stabilization policies arise as a result of international and domestic coordination problems. At the individual country level, it is in the national interest of many countries to adjust trade policies to take advantage of the world market in order to achieve domestic price stability. When countercyclical trade policies become widespread, the result is a thinner and less reliable world market, which further decreases the appeal of laissez-faire. A similar vicious circle operates in the domestic market: without effective policies to protect the poor, such as safety nets, food market liberalization lacks credibility and makes private actors reluctant to intervene, which in turn forces government to step in. The current policy challenge lies in designing policies that will build trust in world markets and increase trust between public and private agents.Lorsque les prix alimentaires flambent dans des pays avec un grand nombre de personnes pauvres, en l'absence d'intervention publique la faim et la malnutrition sont très probables. Pour les gouvernements, intervenir est aussi une question de survie politique. Les interventions publiques prennent souvent la forme d'interventions sur le marché pour stabiliser les prix, ce qui va à l'encontre de la plupart des recommandations internationales, qui sont plutôt d'utiliser des filets de sécurité sociaux et de laisser le marché fonctionner librement. Cependant, malgré les limites des politiques de stabilisation des prix alimentaires, elles sont très répandues dans les pays en développement. Ce chapitre s'attache à éclairer cet état de fait. Les politiques de stabilisation des prix émergent comme le résultat de problèmes internationaux et domestiques de coordination. Il est dans l'intérêt de nombreux pays d'ajuster leurs politiques commerciales pour utiliser le marché mondial à des fins de stabilisation domestique. Mais, lorsque ces politiques commerciales se généralisent, le résultat est un marché mondial plus étroit et moins fiable, ce qui diminue d'autant l'attrait du libre-échange. Un cercle vicieux similaire opère sur le marché domestique. En l'absence de politiques à même de protéger les pauvres efficacement, comme des filets de sécurité sociaux, la libéralisation des marchés alimentaires manque de crédibilité, ce qui rend les acteurs privés réticents à s'investir, poussant les gouvernements à intervenir. L'enjeu politique actuel est donc de proposer des politiques qui permettent d'améliorer les confiances dans les marchés mondiaux et entre les acteurs privés et publics.",['shs']

Result-based payments for “Flowering Meadows” in France : Support tools and collective learning process,"The shift from management prescriptions to result-oriented schemes in France emerged from the largely unpredicted success of collaboration between a team of scientists from INRA and Natural regional Parks that started in 2005 in the Northern Alps. I’m a cofounder and promoter of the Flowering Meadows programme that I will present from a social sciences standpoint, focusing on what makes change happen and why it was well received by farmers. I will thus concentrate on the hidden work which played a crucial role in the success of the French scheme. Finally, I will show how the approach is evolving and point out the key factors and obstacles to effective RBPs. Let’s start with a brief outline of existing RBPs in France. The first set of result-based measures aimed at maintaining the species richness of natural grasslands has been introduced in France in 2007. I have to mention the GRASS_09, or “Pastoral management plan”, that aims at achieving specific features of the mosaic of vegetation strata by grazing herds. However, the agreements currently implemented are mostly action-based and hardly promotes a step-by-step adaptation of management specifications to achieve the desired outcome. The desired ecological outcome of the flagship measure -GRASS_07, commonly known as “Flowering Meadows”, was modelled after the MEKA measure presented by Rainer Oppermann so I won’t go into details. Unlike Germany, the list must be specific to local conditions","['sde', 'shs']"

Both proposals reinforce the protection of farmers against adverse conditions. They may result in very large payments for taxpayers in particular years and could lead to WTO challenges.

Note by note cooking,"Note-by-Note Cooking is a landmark in the annals of gastronomy, liberating cooks from the constraints of traditional ingredients and methods through the use of pure molecular compounds. 1-Octen-3-ol, which has a scent of wild mushrooms; limonene, a colorless liquid hydrocarbon that has the smell of citrus; sotolon, whose fragrance at high concentrations resembles curry and at low concentrations, maple syrup or sugar; tyrosine, an odorless but flavorful amino acid present in cheese--these and many other substances, some occurring in nature, some synthesized in the laboratory, make it possible to create novel tastes and flavors in the same way that elementary sound waves can be combined to create new sounds. Note-by-note cooking promises to add unadulterated nutritional value to dishes of all kinds, actually improving upon the health benefits of so-called natural foods. Cooking with molecular compounds will be far more energy efficient and environmentally sustainable than traditional techniques of cooking. This new way of thinking about food heralds a phase of culinary evolution on which the long-term survival of a growing human population depends. Hervé This clearly explains the properties of naturally occurring and synthesized compounds, dispels a host of misconceptions about the place of chemistry in cooking, and shows why note-by-note cooking is an obvious--and inevitable--extension of his earlier pioneering work in molecular gastronomy.

"Using models to inform policies to meet multiple objectives. Sustainable development, climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation in Central Africa","Land-use change models can help to develop a holistic understanding of the range of potential impacts of different land-use related policy options, and so can strengthen development and implementation of policies to meet a range of objectives, including biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, sustainable development and food security. Brazil’s Native Vegetation Protection Act, commonly known as the Forest Code (FC), is one example of a policy that can be used to achieve several objectives. Using land-use modelling to inform ongoing decisions on how the provisions of the FC are put into practice can help to increase its effectiveness in meeting multiple objectives and commitments. Model projections show that the full implementation of the provisions of the FC will both reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and contribute to conserving biodiversity in Brazil. They further highlight the importance for biodiversity conservation of implementing the Environmental Reserve Tradable Certificate (CRAi in Portuguese) mechanism quickly and effectively. Model results also show the need to put in place additional measures to protect areas, such as the Caatinga forests and grassy savanna in the Cerrado,which may suffer increased land-use pressures as a result of the FC.La modélisation des changements d’affectation des terres peut contribuer à développer une vision globale de l’ensemble des impacts potentiels exercés par les différentes actions possibles concernant l’utilisation des sols. Cela permet également de renforcer l’élaboration et la mise en oeuvre des politiques en vue d’atteindre un certain nombre d’objectifs, concernant notamment le développement durable, l’atténuation du changement climatique, la sécurité alimentaire et la protection de la biodiversité. Les pays membres de la Commission des forêts d’Afrique centrale (COMIFAC) se sont engagés à assurer une gestion durable des espaces forestiers de la région, notamment dans le cadre du « Plan de convergence » de la COMIFAC, et à accomplir les objectifs de développement durable (ODD). La réalisation de ces objectifs est subordonnée à l’élaboration et à l’application des politiques et approches nationales nouvelles et existantes. Les prévisions basées sur la modélisation de l’affectation des terres mettent en lumière de possibles synergies et compromis dans la réalisation des ODD, selon différents scénarios de politiques macroéconomiques et d’utilisation des sols. Elles soulignent en particulier l’importance de protéger efficacement certaines zones et concessions forestières pour la conservation des grands singes et d’autres espèces menacées, et montrent que le maintien de ces zones exerce un impact négligeable sur la production agricole de la région. Au vu du développement continu de la région, étendre les zones protégées pourrait permettre de réduire considérablement le nombre d’espèces perdant une grande partie de leur habitat. Toutefois, l’expansion des zones protégées doit être bien planifiée afin d’éviter de produire des effets néfastes pour certaines espèces ou des troubles sociétaux, tels que l’insécurité alimentaire.",['sdv']

Unfortunately, in this rush to promote government actions within this trend of digitization, little regards is given to the security of such web sites. In many cases, government highly critical web sites are simply produced in a product line fashion using Content Management Systems which the webmasters do not quite master. We discuss in this study our findings on empirically assessing the security of government websites in Burkina Faso. By systematically scanning these websites for simple and well-known vulnerabilities, we were able to discover issues that deserved urgent attention. As an example, we were able to crawl from temporary backup files in a government web site all information (hostname, login and password in clear) to read and write directly in the database and for impersonating the administrator of the website. We also found that around 50% of the government websites are built on top of platforms suffering from 14 publicly known vulnerabilities, and thus can be readily attacked by any hacker.",['info']

Electricity Subsidies: Benefiting some Regions More than Others,"The study highlights geographic variances that result from the length of time that power is supplied to Lebanon's districts. This adds an essential component to the distortion caused by electricities subsidies. Since 2006­-2007, Beirut has received on average nineteen to twenty-one hours of electricity per day, while other regions have received only twelve to fifteen hours if not less. The capital’s residents use more public electricity by default and consequently benefit more from subsidies.",['shs']
"A high quality reprocessed ground-based GPS dataset for atmospheric process studies, radiosonde and model evaluation, and reanalysis of HYMEX Special Observing Period",Data from more than 1000 ground-based GPS receivers in the north-western Mediterranean area have been reprocessed in a consistent way using GIPSY-OASIS II software for the period from 1st September 2012 to 31 March 2013 which encompasses the Special Observation Periods (SOPs) 1 and 2 of the HYMEX project. The reprocessed GPS ZTD data set were screened converted to IWV. The ZTD data were used to assess the accuracy of the near real time ZTD data assimilated for operational weather forecasting. The mean of delay differences between the operational and reprocessed solutions is about 0 +/- 3 mm (mean +/- standard deviation of bias over all stations) and the standard deviation of delay differences ranges between 4 and 8 mm. Significant bias reduction is thus expected from a reanalysis ingesting the reprocessed delay data. Various methods and auxiliary data (surface pressure and weighted mean temperature) are investigated for the conversion of ZTD data into IWV. The final IWV dataset is used to evaluate radiosonde humidity observations and operational analyses produced with the AROME model. The spatial and temporal distribution of IWV is also studied with a focus on heavy precipitation events in the north-western Mediterranean area during the HYMEX SOP1.,"['spi', 'phys']"
"IoTMap, a modelling system for heterogeneous IoT networks","The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) results in a proliferation of different protocols (ZigBee, Bluetooth, 6LowPAN, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, etc.). Organizations tend to quickly deploy several IoT applications over time and thus face heterogeneous IoT systems, combining different IoT protocols in different places of the overall system. This heterogeneity of protocols makes these networks hard to monitor or control, and some misconfigurations or unexpected device behaviours may even expose users to security issues. In this work, we propose IoTMap. IoTMap provides an iterative graph-based modelling of interconnected IoT with a multi-layers view ranging from point-to-point transmissions to application-type analysis. With this modelling, we aim to highlight the network state at a specific time. It can also be used as the intelligence gathering phase during a penetration testing to evaluate the global network security.",['info']
On Evaluating the Quality of RDF Identity Links in the LOD,"The notion of Linked Data is based on the idea that resources from different data sources can be connected by typed links to enable new knowledge that isolated data sources cannot provide on their own. Today, as the Web of Data is proving its importance, and as an huge amount of data is published on the web in form of RDF triples, the quantity of sameAs links is extremely growing as different data sources often describe equivalent resources. Since most of the sameAs links are discovered automatically and the quality of the data sources can be poor, it is becoming crucial to develop methods for evaluating the quality of these RDF identity links, thus providing a ranking measure of their reliability. In this context, this paper defines a initial methodology for analyzing and evaluating a set of given RDF identity links in the Web of Data, ranking their reliability.",['info']
Discovering keys in RDF/OWL dataset with KD2R,"KD2R allows the automatic discovery of composite key constraints in RDF data sources that conform to a given ontol-ogy. We consider data sources for which the Unique Name Assumption is fulfilled. KD2R allows this discovery without having to scan all the data. Indeed, the proposed system looks for maximal non keys and derives minimal keys from this set of non keys. KD2R has been tested on several datasets available on the web of data and it has obtained promising results when the discovered keys are used to link data. In the demo, we will demonstrate the functionality of our tool and we will show on several datasets that the keys can be used in a datalinking tool.",['info']
Transverse target single-spin asymmetry in inclusive electroproduction of charged pions and kaons,"Single-spin asymmetries were investigated in inclusive electroproduction of charged pions and kaons from transversely polarized protons at the HERMES experiment. The asymmetries were studied as a function of the azimuthal angle $\psi$ about the beam direction between the target-spin direction and the hadron production plane, the transverse hadron momentum relative to the direction of the incident beam, and the Feynman variable $x_F$. The $\sin(\psi)$ amplitudes are positive for positive pions and kaons, slightly negative for negative pions and consistent with zero for negative kaons, with particular transverse-momentum but weak $x_F$ dependences. Especially large asymmetries are observed for two small subsamples of events, where also the scattered electron was recorded by the spectrometer.",['phys']
A study of the tribological behavior of duplex treatment,"The objective of this study is to determine the influence of duplex treatment (low pressure thermochemical treatment and PVD coating) on tribological properties. The carbide and carbonitride coatings are deposited by dual RF magnetron sputtering on the reference steel 18CrMo4 and the carburized and carbonitrided one (respectively). The low-pressure carburized and carbonitrided samples present 0.72 and 0.69 w. % carbon content at their surface respectively and a hardness of about 700 Hv0.1. The carburizing and carbonitriding layer are respectively 540 and 390 µm thick, while TiWC and TiWCN were 2.8 and 3.4 µm thick respectively. Tribological tests were performed by a Pin-on-Disk rotative tribometer with alumina and steel (100Cr6) balls. A comparison of the friction coefficient and the wear rate for each sample has been made. The adhesion of the coatings has been performed by analyzing the wear track using optical profilometry, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The best tribological performances were observed by combining carbides coatings and carburized 18CrMo4 or reference steel. In contrast, the TiWCN thin film completely delaminated.","['spi', 'phys']"
Porous Silicon Nanotube Arrays as Anode Material for Li-Ion Batteries,"We report the electrochemical performance of Si nanotube vertical arrays possessing thin porous sidewalls for Li-ion batteries. Porous Si nanotubes were fabricated on stainless steel substrates using a sacrificial ZnO nanowire template method. These porous Si nanotubes are stable at multiple C-rates. A second discharge capacity of 3095 mAh g(-1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 63% is attained at a rate of C/20 and a stable gravimetric capacity of 1670 mAh g(-1) obtained after 30 cycles. The high capacity values are attributed to the large surface area offered by the porosity of the 3D nanostructures, thereby promoting lithium-ion storage according to a pseudocapacitive mechanism.",['chim']
"Phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PhOLEDs) based on 1-methyl-3-propyl-5-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole as the cyclometalated ligand: Influence of the ancillary ligand on the emissive properties","Two heteroleptic iridium complexes have been designed with 1-methyl-3-propyl-5-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole as the cyclometalated ligand and acetylacetone (acac) or dibenzoylmethane (dbm) as the ancillary ligands. Interestingly, when tested as emitters for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), these two isostructural complexes that only have varying ancillary ligands exhibited completely different behaviors in devices. Notably, highly efficient PhOLEDs were only obtained with the complex bearing dbm as the ancillary ligand. To get a deeper insight in this unexpected behavior, TD-DFT calculations were carried out.

On the opposite, Ir6F-based devices showed lower performances than the reference device. As appealing feature, Ir6F-based devices showed almost no efficiency roll-off i.e., no reduction of the luminous efficiency with the current density contrarily to that commonly observed for phosphorescent OLEDs.",['chim']

Role of Vital Trace Elements in Nanocurcumin-Centered Formulation: A Novel Approach to Resuscitate the Immune System,"The present paper described the immunomodulatory potential of novel nanocurcumin-based formulation enriched with trace elements and vitamins on cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in rat model. Major immune-related assays were monitored such as hemagglutination assay, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, cellular immune response, IgG, IgE, IgM, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, hematological study, antioxidant profile, and lipid biomarkers. Chemical characterization of novel formulation showed retention time (R t ) 18.98 of curcumin, while LC-MS data revealed the presence of the curcumin mass at m/z 369.01 [M + H]+ (calculated for C21H21O6 +, 369.13). This novel formulation exhibited significantly (p ≤ 0.001) increased primary and secondary antibody titer by 72.41% and 33.25%, respectively, while DTH response being improved by 87.50% (p ≤ 0.01). However, CD4+, CD8+, and CD28+ counts were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased by 76.46%, 68.21%, and 19.29%, respectively, while the concentrations of IgE, IgM, and IgG were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased by 40%, 28.43%, and 38.75%, respectively. CSF biomarkers analysis showed a decreased level of corticosterone, dopamine, serotonin, and tau protein by 29.38%, 51.73%, 29.93%, and 4.87%, respectively. Antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, GPx, and SOD were increased by 43.74%, 49.00%, and 40.84%, respectively, and non-enzymatic component, GSH, was increased by 55.52%. Similarly, free radical LPO was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) decreased by 40.37%, and acute inflammatory marker, MPO concentration, was reduced by 31.14%, compared with the disease control group. In addition, supportive hematology and lipid profile analysis showed promising results with improved overall animal profile. Thus, trace elements in novel formulation can be used in the various pharmacological activities and as dietary supplement due to its wide properties.",['sdv']
Influence of viscoelastic properties of an hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel on viability of mesenchymal stem cells,"BAC K G RO U N D : The present research is involved in the framework of the biotherapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Here, MSC encapsulation in a hydrogel based on hyaluronic acid (HA) is investigated to optimize the composition of the biomaterial. M E T H O D S : Several formulations candidates of the hydrogel (9 in total) are postulated as a scaffold for the 3D MSC culture in order to investigate their potential to mimic the in vivo cellular environment.

Biological tests are carried out for the measurement of the cell viability of MSC encapsulated in the hydrogels. R E S U LT S : Rheological and biological findings are correlated together in order to establish relationships between the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogel and the cellular viability of MSC.

Thus, such relations are useful tools for scientists offering them more flexibility in the design of their hydrogels while ensuring an acceptable level of MSC viability.",['spi']
Structure and Barrier Properties of Multinanolayered Biodegradable PLA/PBSA Films: Confinement Effect via Forced Assembly Coextrusion,"Multilayer coextrusion processing was applied to produce 2049-layer film of poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) (PBSA) confined against poly(lactic acid) (PLA) using forced assembly, where the PBSA layer thickness was about 60 nm. This unique technology allowed to process semicrystalline PBSA as confined polymer and amorphous PLA as confining polymer in a continuous manner. The continuity of PBSA layers within the 80/20 wt % PLA/PBSA layered films was clearly evidenced by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Similar thermal events to the reference films were revealed by thermal studies; indicating no diffusion of polymers during the melt-processing. Mechanical properties were measured for the multilayer film and the obtained results were those expected considering the fraction of each polymer, revealing the absence of delamination in the PLA/PBSA multinanolayer film. The confinement effect induced by PLA led to a slight orientation of the crystals, an increase of the rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) in PBSA with a densification of this fraction without changing film crystallinity. These structural changes allowed to strongly improve the water vapor and gas barrier properties of the PBSA layer into the multilayer film up to two decades in the case of CO2 gas. By confining the PBSA structure in very thin and continuous layers, it was then possible to improve the barrier performances of a biodegradable system and the resulting barrier properties were successfully correlated to the effect of confinement on the microstructure and the chain segment mobility of the amorphous phase. Such investigation on these multinanolayers of PLA/PBSA with the aim of evidencing relationships between microstructure implying RAF and barrier performances has never been performed yet. Besides, gas and water permeation results have shown that the barrier improvement obtained from the multilayer was mainly due to the reduction of solubility linked to the reduction of the free volume while the tortuosity effect, as usually expected, was not really observed. This work brings new insights in the field of physicochemical behaviors of new multilayer films made of biodegradable polyesters but also in interfacial processes due to the confinement effect induced in these multinanolayer structures obtained by the forced assembly coextrusion. This original coextrusion process was a very advantageous technique to produce eco-friendly materials with functional properties without the help of tie layer, additives, solvents, surface treatments, or inorganic fillers.",['spi']
Resonant-state-expansion Born approximation for waveguides with dispersion,"The resonant-state expansion (RSE) Born approximation, a rigorous perturbative method developed for electrodynamic and quantum mechanical open systems, is further developed to treat waveguides with a Sellmeier dispersion. For media that can be described by these types of dispersion over the relevant frequency range, such as optical glass, I show that the perturbed RSE problem can be solved by diagonalizing a second-order eigenvalue problem. In the case of a single resonance at zero frequency, this is simplified to a generalized eigenvalue problem. Results are presented using analytically solvable planar waveguides and parameters of borosilicate BK7 glass, for a perturbation in the waveguide width. The efficiency of using either an exact dispersion over all frequencies or an approximate dispersion over a narrow frequency range is compared. I included a derivation of the RSE Born approximation for waveguides to make use of the resonances calculated by the RSE, an extension of the well-known Born approximation.",['phys']
Toroidal quadrupole form factor of the deuteron,"We calculate the toroidal quadrupole moment and form factor of the deuteron, which violate time-reversal symmetry but conserve parity, at leading order in two-flavor chiral effective field theory with perturbative pion exchange. We take into account time-reversal and parity violation due to the QCD vacuum angle combined with parity violation resulting from the weak interaction in the Standard Model. We also consider time-reversal and parity violation that at the quark-gluon level results from effective dimension-six operators originating from physics beyond the Standard Model.",['phys']
Convergence properties of {\itshape ab initio} calculations of light nuclei in a harmonic oscillator basis,"We study recently proposed ultraviolet and infrared momentum regulators of the model spaces formed by construction of a variational trial wavefunction which uses a complete set of many-body basis states based upon three-dimensional harmonic oscillator (HO) functions. These model spaces are defined by a truncation of the expansion characterized by a counting number ($\mathcal{N}$) and by the intrinsic scale ($\hbar\omega$) of the HO basis; in short by the ordered pair ($\mathcal{N},\hbar\omega$). In this study we choose for $\mathcal{N}$ the truncation parameter $N_{max}$ related to the maximum number of oscillator quanta, above the minimum configuration, kept in the model space. The ultraviolet (uv) momentum cutoff of the continuum is readily mapped onto a defined uv cutoff in this finite model space, but there are two proposed definitions of the infrared (ir) momentum cutoff inherent in a finite-dimensional HO basis. One definition is based upon the lowest momentum difference given by $\hbar\omega$ itself and the other upon the infrared momentum which corresponds to the maximal radial extent used to encompass the many-body system in coordinate space. Extending both the uv cutoff to infinity and the ir cutoff to zero is prescribed for a converged calculation. We calculate the ground state energy of light nuclei with ""bare"" and ""soft"" $NN$ interactions. By doing so, we investigate the behaviors of the uv and ir regulators of model spaces used to describe $^2$H, $^3$H, $^4$He and $^6$He with $NN$ potentials Idaho N$^3$LO and JISP16. We establish practical procedures which utilize these regulators to obtain the extrapolated result from sequences of calculations with model spaces characterized by ($\mathcal{N},\hbar\omega$).",['phys']
Scattering problems in elastodynamics,"In electromagnetism, acoustics, and quantum mechanics, scattering problems can routinely be solved numerically by virtue of perfectly matched layers (PMLs) at simulation domain boundaries. Unfortunately, the same has not been possible for general elastodynamic wave problems in continuum mechanics. In this Rapid Communication, we introduce a corresponding scattered-field formulation for the Navier equation. We derive PMLs based on complex-valued coordinate transformations leading to Cosserat elasticity-tensor distributions not obeying the minor symmetries. These layers are shown to work in two dimensions, for all polarizations, and all directions. By adaptative choice of the decay length, the deep subwavelength PMLs can be used all the way to the quasistatic regime. As demanding examples, we study the effectiveness of cylindrical elastodynamic cloaks of the Cosserat type and approximations thereof.",['phys']
Adsorptive desulfurization with CPO-27/MOF-74: an experimental and computational investigation,"By combining experimental adsorption isotherms, microcalorimetric data, infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations the adsorption behaviour of the CPO-27/MOF-74 series (Ni, Co, Mg, Cu, and Zn) in the desulfurization of fuels is evaluated. The results show a clear influence of the metal ion on the adsorption capacity and affinity for S-heterocyclic compounds, with CPO-27(Ni) being the best performing material both in terms of capacity and affinity. The microcalorimetric data and infrared spectroscopy confirm the high affinity of CPO-27(Ni) for thiophene and similar compounds, while the computational data reveal that the origin of this outstanding adsorption performance is the strong sulfur-metal interaction.",['chim']
The Elusive link Between Scientific Models and their Targets,"A brief examination of the most recent literature in philosophy of science shows that a host of research in this area studies the fictionalist approach to scientific models and related approaches such as van Fraassen's latest book (2008) on scientific representation. Van Fraassen's idea, to put it bluntly, relies on the idea that measurement is the main instrument by the means of which natural sciences achieve the representation aims expressed by scientific models. Moreover, if scientific knowledge is associated with the deployment of some kind of explicative power, this power is closely related to the representation devices developed between the 17 th and 18 th century, when these were conceived as involving specific forms of measurement: measurement locates the target in a theoretically constructed logical space (van Fraassen 2008, p.2). The main objective of our talk is to delve into the logical features of such kind of approaches: the point is to understand the location-mechanism. On one hand we will follow a seminal idea of Olsson and Westlund (2006) that proposed to add to a scientific model a set of open questions (its scientific agenda), and on the other, we will deploy a recent proposal of Rahman/Redmond (2015) to conceive objects of models as functions (dependent-proof objects) of hypothetical judgments as formulated in the frame of constructive type theory. Against such a background, the point is how to relate those functions with the purported targets of the scientific model they constitute. Our main claim is that this achieved by a mapping. The specification mechanism of such a mapping, we claim, is related to those questions that constitute the agenda of the underlying theory and more particularly to the questions related to the relevant measurement theory.",['shs']

Investigation of the earthquake ground motion coherence in heterogeneous non-linear soil deposits,"The physics-based numerical simulation is a reliable tool to build-up source-to-site strong ground motion earthquake scenarios. In this paper, we enhance those forward simulations by including (1) the hysteretic non-linear behaviour of geomaterials and (2) the heterogeneous nature of soils. Scattering-induced damping, ground motion spatial incoherence and de-amplification may therefore be reproduced. A classical case study is considered herein: a seismic wave generated by a localized double-couple earthquake propagating towards the surface through layered elastic homogeneous bedrock, underlying a heterogeneous non-linear soil stratum. 3D numerical simulations were performed by means of a Spectral Element Method (SEM) code. The latter was coupled with a highly scalable random field generator to reproduce the media heterogeneity. Moreover, an extension to J 2 elasto-plasticity numerical integration was introduced. Time-histories and lagged-coherency curves at the surface show the ground motion de-amplification (mainly related to soil non-linearity) and loss of coherency (due to the wave-scattering caused by soil heterogeneity).","['spi', 'phys']"
"On Rational Physics: a Basic Formalism for Relativistic Physics – and ""A Unique Mathematical Derivation of the Fundamental Laws of Nature Based on a New Algebraic Approach","In Part I (pp. 1-10) of this article, I provide a general analysis of a number of current discontinuous approaches to fundamental physics. In Part II (the main part, pp. 11-99, Ref. [37]), as a new mathematical approach to the origin of basic laws of nature, using a new algebraic axiomatic (matrix) formalism based on the ring theory and Clifford algebras (presented in Sec.2), <b>""it is shown that certain mathematical forms of the fundamental laws of nature, including laws governing the fundamental forces of nature (represented by a set of two definite classes of general covariant massive field equations, with new matrix formalisms), are derived uniquely from only a very few axioms""</b>; where in agreement with the rational Lorentz group, it is also basically assumed that the components of relativistic energy-momentum can only take rational values. Based on the definite mathematical formalism of this axiomatic approach, along with the C, P and T symmetries (represented by the corresponding quantum matrix operators) of the fundamentally derived field equations, it is concluded that the universe could be realized solely with the (1+2) and (1+3)-dimensional space-times. On the basis of these discrete symmetries of the derived field equations, it has been also shown that only left-handed particle fields (along with their complementary right-handed fields) could be coupled to the corresponding (any) source currents. Moreover, it is shown that the (1+3)-dimensional cases of uniquely determined two classes of general covariant field equations, represent, respectively, new massive forms of the bispinor fields of spin-2, and spin-1 particles; and (1+2)-dimensional cases of these equations represent new massive forms of the bispinor fields of spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 particles, respectively. As a particular consequence, it is shown that a certain massive formalism of general relativity – with a definite form of torsion field appeared originally as the generator of gravitational field’s invariant mass – is obtained only by first quantization (followed by a basic procedure of minimal coupling to space-time geometry) of a certain set of special relativistic algebraic matrix equations. It has been also proved that Lagrangian densities specified for the originally derived new massive forms of the Maxwell, Yang-Mills and Dirac field equations, are also gauge invariant, where the invariant mass of each field is generated solely by the corresponding torsion field. In addition, in agreement with recent astronomical data, a new form of massive gauge boson is identified (compatible with U(1) symmetry group) with invariant mass: ""<b><i>m</i><sub>γ</sub> ≈ 4.90571×10<sup>-50</sup>kg</b>"", which generated by a coupled torsion field of the background space-time geometry. Moreover, based on the definite mathematical formalism of this axiomatic approach, along with the C, P and T symmetries (represented basically by the corresponding quantum operators) of the fundamentally derived field equations, it has been concluded that the universe could be realized solely with the (1+2) and (1+3)-dimensional space-times (where this conclusion, in particular, is based on the T-symmetry). It is proved that CPT is the only (unique) combination of C, P, and T symmetries that could be defined as a symmetry for interacting fields. In addition, on the basis of these discrete symmetries of derived field equations, it has been also shown that only left-handed particle fields (along with their complementary right-handed fields) could be coupled to the corresponding (any) source currents. Furthermore, it has been shown that the metric of background space-time is diagonalized for the uniquely derived fermion field equations (defined and expressed solely in (1+2)-dimensional space-time), where this property generates a certain set of additional symmetries corresponding uniquely to the ""SU(2)<sub>L</sub>⊗U(2)<sub>R</sub>"" symmetry group for spin-1/2 fermion fields (representing “1+3” generations of four fermions, including a group of eight leptons and a group of eight quarks), and also the ""SU(2)<sub>L</sub>⊗U(2)<sub>R</sub>"" gauge symmetry groups for spin-1 boson fields coupled to the spin-1/2 fermionic source currents. <b>Hence, along with the known elementary particles, eight new elementary particles, including four new charge-less right-handed spin-1/2 fermions (two leptons and two quarks), a spin-3/2 fermion, and also three new spin-1 (massive) bosons are predicted axiomatically by this new mathematical approach (on a fundamental gauge-theoretic basis)</b>. As a particular result, based on the definite matrix formalism of the uniquely derived general covariant form of Maxwell (and also Yang-Mills) field equations, it has been also concluded that magnetic monopoles could not exist in nature.

Influence of the Non-Schmid Effects on the Ductility Limit of Polycrystalline Sheet Metals,"The yield criterion in rate-independent single crystal plasticity is most often defined by the classical Schmid law. However, various experimental studies have shown that the plastic flow of several single crystals (especially with Body Centered Cubic crystallographic structure) often exhibits some non-Schmid effects. The main objective of the current contribution is to study the impact of these non-Schmid effects on the ductility limit of polycrystalline sheet metals. To this end, the Taylor multiscale scheme is used to determine the mechanical behavior of a volume element that is assumed to be representative of the sheet metal. The mechanical behavior of the single crystals is described by a finite strain rate-independent constitutive theory, where some non-Schmid effects are accounted for in the modeling of the plastic flow. The bifurcation theory is coupled with the Taylor multiscale scheme to predict the onset of localized necking in the polycrystalline aggregate. The impact of the considered non-Schmid effects on both the single crystal behavior and the polycrystal behavior is carefully analyzed. It is shown, in particular, that non-Schmid effects tend to precipitate the occurrence of localized necking in polycrystalline aggregates and they slightly influence the orientation of the localization band.",['spi']
"Direct measurement of local constitutive relations, at the micrometre scale, in bulk metallic alloys","Multiscale models involving crystal plasticity are essential to predict the elastoplastic behavior of structural materials with respect to their microstructure. However, those models are often limited by a poor knowledge of the local constitutive behavior. This article reports a method to measure the mechanical behavior directly, at the micrometre scale, in bulk crystalline materials. Local strain and stress states were evaluated at the surface of a bent stainless steel crystal by combining total strain measurements – performed with the digital image correlation technique on optical images – with elastic strain measurements obtained by Laue microdiffraction. A local constitutive relation was measured, in an efficient nondestructive way, without the need for full-field simulations. The method was validated by a comparison between the measured local behavior and the macroscopic behavior of the single crystal.",['spi']

Topophonie Research Project,"Topophonies are virtual navigable sound spaces, composed of sounding or audio-graphic objects. Graphic and sounding shapes or objects are audio-graphic when visual and audio modalities are synchronized. In virtual reality and videogames, we know how to make scenes composed of point-shaped elements: graphic and sound (i.e. a spot representing an object). However, there is no tool enabling navigation to make scenes consisting of very great numbers of interactive visual and sound elements. Nor dispersed elements such as in a crowd, a flow of traffic, foliage or rain. The research project Topophonie proposes lines of research and innovative developments for sound and visual navigation in spaces composed of multiple and disseminated sound and visual elements. By working in a scientific multidisciplinary group (digital audio, visualization, sound design) with enterprises specialized in the domain of interactive multimedia activities, the project Topophonie is going to conceive and develop models, interfaces and audio-graphic renderings of groups of granular animated and spatialized objects. The project team is composed of researchers specialised in granular sound renderings and in advanced interactive graphic renderings, as well as digital designers and enterprises specialised in the relevant fields of application.Nous nommons topophonies des espaces virtuels navigables composés d’un ensemble d’objets sonores et/ou audiographiques. Le terme audiographique désigne des formes graphiques et sonores dans lesquelles les modalités visuelle et sonore sont synchronisées. On sait bien rendre des scènes composées d'éléments graphiques et sonores ponctuels (points, objets), en réalité virtuelle et dans les jeux vidéo. En revanche, il n'y a pas d'outil permettant la navigation et le rendu interactif de scènes comportant des éléments visuels et sonores en très grands nombres et dispersés tels qu'une foule, un flux de circulation automobile, un hall de machines, un feuillage ou une pluie. Le projet de recherche Topophonie propose des directions de recherche et de développement innovantes pour la navigation sonore et visuelle dans des espaces composés d'éléments sonores et visuelles multiples et disséminés. En faisant travailler une équipe scientifique pluridisciplinaire (audio numérique, image de synthèse, design sonore) et des entreprises spécialisées dans le domaine des rendus multimédias interactifs, le projet Topophonie va concevoir et développer des modèles, des interfaces et des rendus audiographiques navigables d'ensembles d’objets granulaires, animés et spatialisés. L’équipe du projet est composée de chercheurs spécialisés en rendu sonore granulaire et en rendu graphique avancé interactif, de designers numériques et d’entreprises spécialisées dans les domaines d’applications concernés. Cette recherche s’articule en trois temps : un travail d’études et d’expérimentations pour la définition de modèles génériques et la réalisation de prototypes fonctionnant sur des maquettes de démonstration, et un deuxième temps de conception des composants nécessaires à la mise en œuvre des applications d’usage que nous développerons dans un troisième temps. Les travaux réalisés fourniront des interfaces de définition et de contrôle de scènes multimédias et des outils de rendu temps réels sur les canaux audio et visuels synchronisés. Les enjeux scientifiques portent sur la définition d'un modèle de données génériques, sur la réalisation d'interfaces pour la définition efficace et fine de grands volumes d'objets audio et graphiques non homogènes, et sur le rendu lissé et interactif de ces objets en déplacement. Ces développements seront réalisés sur trois scènes de niveaux de détails et de comportements variables: par exemple de la pluie au niveau le plus fin, des feuillages animés au niveau intermédiaire et une foule pour la plus grosse granularité. En plus de leur association à la conception et au développement des modèles supportant les recherches scientifiques, les partenaires industriels développeront des applications sur la navigation interactive cartographique et géolocalisée, sur les univers virtuels interactifs tels que les plans urbains ou les jeux vidéo, sur les effets spéciaux pour l’audiovisuel et sur les environnements multimédia pour les installations d'arts numériques ou muséographiques.",['info']
Parametric Verification: An Introduction,"This paper constitutes a short introduction to parametric verification of concurrent systems. It originates from two 1-day tutorial sessions held at the Petri nets conferences in Toru\'n (2016) and Zaragoza (2017). The paper presents not only the basic formal concepts tackled in the video version, but also an extensive literature to provide the reader with further references covering the area. We first introduce motivation behind parametric verification in general, and then focus on different models and approaches, for verifying several kinds of systems. They include Parametric Timed Automata, for modelling real-time systems, where the timing constraints are not necessarily known a priori. Similarly, Parametric Interval Markov Chains allow for modelling systems where probabilities of events occurrences are intervals with parametric bounds. Parametric Petri Nets allow for compact representation of systems, and cope with different types of parameters. Finally, Action Synthesis aims at enabling or disabling actions in a concurrent system to guarantee some of its properties. Some tools implementing these approaches were used during hands-on sessions at the tutorial. The corresponding practicals are freely available on the Web.",['info']

Open Power and Energy Optimization Platform and Estimator (Open-People) ANR Project,"Designing low power complex embedded systems is now a critical challenge for a large number of electronic corporations. Low power is generally critical due to its impact on lifetime, battery longevity, battery capacity, temperature constraints, etc. Unfortunately, when a designer needs some power estimations about its design, the methods and tools which can help him are not sufficient. Indeed, there is a lack of efficient methodology and accurate tool to obtain power/energy estimation of a complete system at different abstraction levels. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a global framework for power/energy estimation and optimization of heterogeneous MultiProcessor System on Chip (MPSoC). This framework supports both a power modeling methodology and a power platform estimations which can help the designer to choose the best solution for his design. The methodology supported takes into account all the embedded system's relevant aspects; the software, the hardware, and the operating system. It includes several estimation tools with respect to their abstraction levels in order to cover the overall design flow. Starting from functional estimation and down to real boards measurements, our platform helps designers to develop new power models, to explore new architectures, and to apply optimization techniques in order to reduce energy and power consumption of the system. The usefulness and the effectiveness of the proposed power estimation framework are demonstrated through a typical embedded system conceived around the Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA platform.",['info']
Multilayer Langmuir-Blodgett films as diffractive external 3D photonic crystal in blue OLEDs.,"Three-dimensional Langmuir-Blodgett films made of silica beads are theoretically and experimentally investigated in order to improve the relatively small efficiency of blue OLEDs. Using films made of 5 layers of beads, we fabricated OLEDs emitting at 476 nm, and measured a gain of around 40% on their external quantum efficiency. An optical model has been developed to accurately handle the fact that the organic emitting layer and the photonic extraction layer are separated by a distance greater than 1000 wavelength. The latter also permits to describe rapidly this three-dimensional optical OLED cavity, without redoing all the numerical simulations when the optical properties of the organic layers are changed (material index, thicknesses).","['chim', 'phys']"
3D Interaction in Virtual Environments for Systems EngineeringInteractions 3D en environnements virtuels pour l'ingénierie systèmes,"This paper discusses the potential benefits of applying Virtual Reality (VR) technology to the context of Systems Engineering (SE), for both educational and industrial purposes. After an introductive presentation of the two fields and their state of the art, we explore if and how VR can be of assistance to the processes involved in a typical SE approach. We especially focus on commonly used 3D interaction techniques in VR and argue that the design of appropriate 3D interactions is a key ingredient for the success of VR in SE. We suggest three research directions that may be considered for this design: interaction generality, context awareness and adaptability. The 3D interactions should adapt, manually or automatically, to the VR device, the virtual scene and the user context.",['info']
"Simulations of the impact of co-injected gases on CO2 storage, the SIGARRR project: first results on water-gas interactions modeling","When capturing CO2, the collected gas mixture can vary considerably both qualitatively and quantitatively, based on the CO2 origin, the capture process and the industrial sector. Co-injected with CO2, these impurities might be an issue in case of leakage but may also impact the subsurface storage. Operators of the whole CCS chain are therefore waiting for recommendations in terms of admissible concentrations while regulators are waiting for tools allowing them to formulate these recommendations. The SIGARRR project aims at proposing accurate reactive-transport simulations to model the long-term behavior of CO2 and its coinjected gases within storage sites focusing on the reactivity with reservoirs and the possible inferences on the environment. The paper presents first numerical results on water-gas equilibriums in agreement with experiments.",['chim']

Incarceration And Its Disseminations: COVID-19 Pandemic Lessons From Chicago’sCook County Jail,"Jails and prisons are major sites of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Many jurisdictions in the United States have therefore accelerated release of low-risk offenders. Early release, however, does not address how arrest and pre-trial detention practices may be contributing to disease spread. Using data from Cook County Jail, in Chicago, Illinois, one of the largest known nodes of SARS-CoV-2 spread, we analyze the relationship between jailing practices and community infections at the zip-code level. We find that jail cycling is a significant predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, accounting for 55 percent of the variance in case rates across zip codes in Chicago and 37 percent in Illinois. By comparison, jail cycling far exceeds race, poverty, public transit utilization, and population density as a predictor of variance. The data suggest that cycling through Cook County Jail alone is associated with 15.7 percent of all documented novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Illinois and 15.9 percent in Chicago as of April 19, 2020. Our findings support arguments for reduced reliance on incarceration and for related justice reforms both as emergency measures during the present pandemic and as sustained structural changes vital for future pandemic preparedness and public health.",['shs']

D-Sieve: A Novel Data Processing Engine for Efficient Handling of Crises-Related Social Messages,"Existing literature demonstrates the usefulness of system-mediated algorithms, such as supervised machine learning for detecting classes of messages in the social-data stream (e.g., topically relevant vs. irrelevant). The classification accuracies of these algorithms largely depend upon the size of labeled samples that are provided during the learning phase. Other factors such as class distribution, term distribution among the training set also play an important role on clas-sifier's accuracy. However, due to several reasons (money / time constraints, limited number of skilled labelers etc.), a large sample of labeled messages is often not available immediately for learning an efficient classification model. Consequently, classifier trained on a poor model often mis-classifies data and hence, the applicability of such learning techniques (especially for the online setting) during ongoing crisis response remains limited. In this paper, we propose a post-classification processing step leveraging upon two additional content features-stable hashtag association and stable named entity association, to improve the classification accuracy for a classifier in realistic settings. We have tested our algorithms on two crisis datasets from Twitter (Hurricane Sandy 2012 and Queensland Floods 2013), and compared our results against the results produced by a "" best-in-class "" baseline online classifier. By showing the consistent better quality results than the baseline algorithm i.e., by correctly classifying the misclassified data points from the prior step (false negative and false positive to true positive and true negative classes, respectively), we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in practice.",['info']

"Presentation of the Restoration of Zayayn Khüree by the Monaco-Mongolian Joint Archaeological Expedition. Organisation, Schedule, Objectives and Results","In 2007, part of the scientific team of the Monaco-Mongolian Joint Archaeological Expedition was mandated by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sciences of Mongolia to lead a survey of the four buildings composing the Lavran of Zayayn Khüree. The Güden Süm (also called Lavran) to the north, the two lateral Semchins and the Entrance Hall now house the Museum of Arkhangai Province. The buildings required urgent restoration, especially waterproofing the roofs. The diagnosis given by Fabrice Laudrin (Bibracte Research Centre) focused on the weaknesses of the Eastern Semchin, the structure of which had suffered great distortions. The Office of International Cooperation of Monaco Principality, which had supported the survey, continued its support by funding historical and architectural research on the buildings and the subsequent restoration work from 2007 to 2013. It was important to understand the turbulent history of this monastery before working on its structure. Isabelle Charleux brought her knowledge and vast experience to help establish the chronology of the historical events that have marked the monastery complex and its surroundings from the 17th century on. The in-depth research carried out by Krisztina Teleki and Zsuzsa Majer in the archives and drawing on local monks’ and laypersons’ testimonies has increased our knowledge of the social and political context of the past eighty years. The buildings themselves bear the scars of the political and cultural changes. Thus when Amélie Perrier (now Assistant Professor, University of Orléans) participated in the survey, she also documented the traces of the successive transformations that the structures and decorations of the buildings had undergone. Finally, the Monaco-Mongolian Joint Archaeological Expedition entrusted architect Natalia Markova to draw up complete plans of the four buildings. Following all these studies, restoration began in autumn 2010 with the Eastern Semchin. Restoration work continued in 2012 with the complete replacement of the Entrance Hall roof. From the outset, the restoration project was placed under the aegis of UNESCO, meeting the goals and ideals of the organization for the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage situated along the ancient Northern Silk Roads.Монгол улсын Боловсрол, соёл, шинжлэх ухааны яамны зөвшөөрлийн дагуу Монгол-Монакогийн хамтарсан археологийн экспедицийн судалгааны баг Заяын хүрээний лавирангийн бүрдэл болох дөрвөн барилгад 2007 оноос судалгаа хийж эхэлсэн юм.

Temporally Coherent Video De-Anaglyph,"For a long time, stereoscopic 3D videos were usually encoded and shown in the anaglyph format. This format combines the two stereo views into a single color image by splitting its color spectrum and assigning each view to one half of the spectrum, for example red for the left and cyan (blue+green) for the right view. Glasses with matching color filters then separate the color channels again to provide the appropriate view to each eye. This simplicity made anaglyph stereo a popular choice for showing stereoscopic content, as it works with existing screens, projectors and print media. However, modern stereo displays and projectors natively support two full-color views, and avoid the viewing discomfort associated with anaglyph videos. Our work investigates how to convert existing anaglyph videos to the full-color stereo format used by modern displays. Anaglyph videos only contain half the color information compared to the full-color videos, and the missing color channels need to be reconstructed from the existing ones in a plausible and temporally coherent fashion. Joulin and Kang [2013] propose an approach that works well for images, but their extension to video is limited by the heavy computational complexity of their approach. Other techniques only support single images and when applied to each frame of a video generally produce flickering results. In our approach, we put the temporal coherence of the stereo results front and center by expressing Joulin and Kang's approach within the practical temporal consistency framework of Lang et al. [2012]. As a result, our approach is both efficient and temporally coherent. In addition, it computes temporally coherent optical flow and disparity maps that can be used for various post-processing tasks.",['info']

Level of Detail Continuum for Huge Geometric Data,"We propose a unified solution for the creation of levels of detail on very large input data. We build a hierarchical signed distance function in an octree around the data and use this hierarchy to generate a continuum of levels of detail. Our distance function construction, based on the Gradient Vector Flow and the Poisson equation, builds on multigrid resolution algorithms. Using an appropriate interpolation scheme within the octree we obtain a continuous hierarchical distance function, which allows us to define a continuum of levels of detail for huge geometries. During this process, holes and undersampling issues in the input data are automatically corrected. We present three applications of our hierarchy: a novel hierarchical deformable model scheme that can automatically reconstruct closed Eulerian meshes of up to a million faces in a few minutes, an alternate distance-driven contouring approach, and raytracing of huge data models.",['info']
The ‘ecologisation’ of European Agricultures. A critical assessment of the ecological modernisation and treadmill of production perspectives,"Ecologisation” is the word chosen by the Ecodevelopment, a French multi-disciplinary research unit, to qualify the current trend of European Union agricultural and rural policies and its effects on agricultural production systems. The first part of the presentation analyzes the process itself, the gradual extension of the sphere of agricultural and rural activities affected by environmentally oriented policies: from the periphery to the core of the agricultural sector, from limited agri-environmental rules to cross compliance. It examines also the alternative between the “greening” (or “green washing”) of the dominant modernised agricultural systems or the process of designing new agricultural production models aimed at fulfilling these new obligations, the alternative between considering environmental demand as constraints or at the contrary opportunities for inventing ecologically based agricultural production, and the consequencies of these policies on social equity for farmers and consumers. The second part of the presentation intents to assess these processes at the light of two theoretical streams of environmental social sciences: Ecological Modernization and Treadmill of Production. The heuristic value and the limits of each of these theoretical approaches are identified. Ecological Modernization is valued for its assessment of innovations in the production and production/consumption systems, but can be questioned on the assertion of the capacity of the capitalist production system to internalize by itself ecologization demands. Treadmill of Production is valued for its interest for the leading part of social movements in building local and global alternative production and consumption systems, but is weaker when taking into account the development of ecologization in public policies. In conclusion, the relevance of choosing the world ""ecologization"" is discussed as compared with other terms which are propound to designate the trend of European Union agricultural policy: ""greening"", ""multi-functionality"", ""sustainable agricultural development""…","['sdv', 'shs']"

The aim of the present study was to look for candidate genomic regions by taking advantage of a unique resource population of two divergent lines selected for the breast meat ultimate pH from a commercial fast-growing line. Two complementary approaches were applied: detection of selection signatures at each of the first 5 generations of selection (G1 to G5) and QTL mapping by genome-wide association study at the sixth generation (G6). Thanks to genotyping with the 57K Illumina SNP array of 288 sires from generations G0 to G5, we identified more than one hundred selection signatures. They determined 63 candidate regions, among which some were selected from the first generation and remained significant throughout the selection process. GWAS analysis of 558 phenotyped and genotyped animals revealed 24 QTL regions for breast meat pHu and 10 QTL for thigh meat pHu. Our results indicLe pH ultime (pHu) est un déterminant majeur des propriétés technologiques et sensorielles de la viande de poulet. Il semble également associé au développement de défauts musculaires tels que les striations blanches ou le Wooden Breast. Alors qu’une forte composante génétique de ce caractère a été mise en évidence, les gènes contrôlant le pHu restent inconnus. L’objectif de notre étude était de rechercher des régions génomiques candidates en exploitant un modèle unique de deux lignées divergentes sélectionnées pour le pH ultime du filet à partir d’une souche commerciale à croissance rapide. Deux approches complémentaires ont été mises en oeuvre : la détection de signatures de sélection à chacune des 5 premières générations de sélection (G1 à G5) et la détection de QTL à la sixième génération (G6). Le génotypage grâce à la puce SNP Illumina 57K de 288 pères des générations G0 à G5 a conduit à l’identification de plus d’une centaine de signatures de sélection. Elles déterminent 63 régions candidates dont quelques-unes sont sélectionnées dès la première génération puis tout au long du processus de sélection. L’analyse GWAS de 558 animaux phénotypés et génotypés a mis en évidence 24 régions QTL pour le pHu du filet et 10 pour le pHu de la cuisse. L’ensemble de ces résultats va dans le sens d’un déterminisme polygénique du pH ultime de la viande tout en révélant le rôle important de plusieurs régions candidates.",['sdv']
Efficient 3D Audio Processing on the GPU,"Audio processing applications are among the most computeintensive and often rely on additional DSP resources for realtime performance. However, programmable audio DSPs are in general only available to product developers. Professional audio boards with multiple DSPs usually support specific effects and products while consumer ""game-audio"" hardware still only implements fixed-function pipelines which evolve at a rather slow pace. The widespread availability and increasing processing power of GPUs could offer an alternative solution. GPU features, like multiply-accumulate instructions or multiple execution units, are similar to those of most DSPs [3]. Besides, 3D audio rendering applications require a significant number of geometric calculations, which are a perfect fit for the GPU. Our feasibility study investigates the use of GPUs for efficient audio processing.",['info']

"Taste is also learnedLe goût aussi, ça s'apprend","The first days of a person's existence influence the rest of their life. This is equally true in terms of taste, as the work of professor Luc Pénicaud from the Center for Taste and Feeding Behavior (CSGA) appears to attest. According to him, the most opportune period to learn to like a new food is between the ages of 4 months and 2 years. Even better, in this time period we also learn to regulate our eating objectively. The child remembers the effects of absorbing a given food and adapts his behavior accordingly, and this for a long time. This would explain a very old béarnaise tradition that consists of rubbing a clove of garlic on the lips of newborns to instill in them the penchant for the odorous cloves.",['sdv']

Evaluation of a reference population in dairy goats for genomic selection,"AbstractReference population is the main point to succeed in genomic selection, improving genetic breeding value accuracies. The aim of this study was to characterize the structure ofthe multi-breed (Alpine and Saanen) dairy goat reference population genotyped with a 50kchip, studying level of relationship and linkage disequilibrium extent within population. Several reference populations (from 20 males to 705 males and 1 946 females) were designedto examine effect of population size and interest of female genotypes on genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) using GBLUP. Feasibility of genomic selection in goats wasconsidered comparing GEBV accuracies and ascendance accuracy calculated for youngmales. The reference population considered in this study with 250 effective founders and 0.115 level of LD extent between two consecutive markers was not perfect for genomicselection. Increase population size induced proportional increase in GEBV accuracies from + 2% to + 31 % according to the case studied and the trait. Adding female genotypes improved accuracy from + 0.28 to + 0.01 depending on the reference population and trait studied, more relevant considering small population size. Genomic selection did not improve GEBV accuracies for young males except for those with sires genotyped.",['sdv']
The Political Economy of Central Banking: Historical Perspectives,"The question of the relationship between monetary and fiscal authorities seems to be more complex than the recent debate on central bank independence would suggest. In the simple framework inspired by Sargent and Wallace (1976), the recipe for establishing an untarnished confidence in central bank money consisted in severing all links between governments and central bankers. In reality, however, monetary and fiscal authorities can hardly be separated at all: in fact, they are the two sides of the same coin – which is, the modern state. The idea that monetary and fiscal authorities can live their lives oblivious of each other does not seem to be validated by historical evidence.",['shs']
Education level and the distance-income migration trade-off,"Most research in the field of migration demonstrates that the level of education functions as one of its major determinants. Such research focuses on the finding that spatial mobility is more frequent, and wages greater, the higher the level of studies. Nevertheless, these results are quite sensitive to the estimation method, as well as to the selection of the geographic area variable measuring spatial mobility. By considering “internal migration” within France of young French workers, between the labor market in the locality where they finished their studies in 1998 and the labor market where they were employed three years after leaving the educational system, we propose to estimate the impact of spatial mobility on wages, as a result of the costsbenefits migration trade-off based on the distance covered during the relocation. We observe that the most highly-skilled youths do not receive a positive wage return from migration, demonstrating concomitantly that these young workers must contend with the national labor market. However, the opposite situation is observed for less-skilled young workers who obtain positive wage returns from migration. Another noteworthy result is that benefit from migration is transformed into the distance-income migration trade-off as a function of territorial characteristics","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"

‘Othering Each Other’ in Shakespeare’s The Tempest,"This study includes Postcolonialism in Shakespeare's The Tempest. It aims at examining Bhabha's notions of ambivalence and hybridity that he estimates as to be great forms of resistance against the colonial agency. Ambivalence generates a controversial position and viewpoint both for Caliban and Prospero in the play. Caliban is a colonized other and unable to replicate himself accurately to the European colonizers. It inflames Caliban to be 'turbulent for liberty' that results in his resistance and insurgency against Prospero and the colonial authority. It confirms his hybrid nature that terrorizes Prospero to lose his exclusive authority on the island and challenges the 'monolithic power' of the invaders. Ariel is a subservient spirit unlike Caliban, though his craving for liberty brands him turbulent too. The paper explores the ambiguities of portraying the ambivalent non-European characters and investigates each non-European character in the play is figured within a given geopolitical context that relates to ambivalence, an outcome of hybridity. Hybridity enables the colonized to absorb and mimic the norms of the dominant culture and may result in psychological forms of coercion by backbiting and by othering each other. Consequently, the colonized turn out to be a blend of intricate individualities in a hybrid formation, that enables the others to fight back by othering the settler.",['shs']
The Exploration of Ambivalence and Hybridity in The Tempest,"The paper focuses on how ambivalence sets off a scandalous locus exclusively intended for Caliban and Ariel in The Tempest. Caliban, a colonized-divided-self, is incapable of reproducing himself accurately to the European settlers. This provocative feature stimulates Caliban and Ariel to be turbulent for liberty resulting from their resistance and rebellion against Prospero and the colonial legacy reinforcing their hybridization that intimidates Prospero too to lose his sole authority over the island, and trials his 'monolithic power. Ariel is a submissive spirit unlike Caliban; he is deprived of the concrete human figure where Caliban is portrayed as a semi-human creature. Consequently, the ambivalent portrayal of Ariel and Caliban emphasizes the blend of convoluted identities in a hybrid formation, which invites the postcolonial critics to debate on.",['shs']

Trajectory Tracking For A Quadrotor Under Wind Perturbations: Sliding Mode Control With State-Dependent Gains,"The problem of position tracking of a mini drone subject to wind perturbations is investigated. The solution is based on a detailed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) model, with aerodynamic coefficients and external disturbance components, which is introduced in order to better represent the impact of the wind field. Then, upper bounds of wind-induced disturbances are characterized, which allow a sliding mode control (SMC) technique to be applied with guaranteed convergence properties. The peculiarity of the considered case is that the disturbance upper bounds depend on the control amplitude itself (i.e. the system is nonlinear in control), which leads to a new procedure for the control tuning presented in the paper. The last part of the paper is dedicated to the analysis and reduction of chattering effects, as well as investigation of rotor dynamics issues. Conventional SMC with constant gains, proposed first order SMC, and proposed quasi-continuous SMC are compared. Nonlinear UAV simulator, validated through in-door experiments, is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controls.","['info', 'spi']"
Information Aversion,"Information aversion, a preference-based fear of news flows, has rich implications for decisions involving information and risk-taking.

Information averse investors display an ostrich behavior: overhearing negative news prompts more inattention. Their fear of frequent news encourages them to hold undiversified portfolios.",['shs']
Modélisation des épisodes d'acidose sub-clinique et du comportement alimentaire associé : application à la chèvre laitière,"Subacute ruminal acidosis is one of the major concerns of ruminant nutrition. It is mainly characterised by very quick and severe disturbances of an equilibrium, during which animals eat and produce around their potential. Bouts of acidosis are very rarely described in the literature. An experiment was performed on 12 cannulated dairy goats fed a high concentrate diet in order to describe these bouts of acidosis and their consequences on intake, production and behaviour of the animals. We performed daily measurements of intake and production and continuous measurements of intake, chewing and rumen pH. Modelling these bouts of acidosis showed that a bout of acidosis is characterised by a very quick pH drop, followed successively by intake and milk yield drops. The pH drop is followed by a few days of high rumen pH, which then slowly returns to pre bout acidosis values. Bouts of acidosis can influence intake and milk production during more than three weeks. Modelling intake using a method based on segmentation/classification showed that intake was disrupted during bouts of acidosis. The animals ate less with a high intake rate but more with a low intake rate. Simultaneous analysis of intake, rumination and rumen pH kinetics showed that the disruption of intake behaviour led to a disruption of rumination behaviour. Furthermore, these changes in feeding behaviour led to more stable kinetics of rumen pH, which did not decrease below 6.0.L’acidose sub-clinique est un problème majeur des élevages intensifs de ruminants. Elle est caractérisée par des épisodes de perturbations ponctuelles et brutales d’un état d’équilibre, pendant lequel les animaux ingèrent et produisent, en moyenne, à leur potentiel. Les épisodes d’acidose ont été très peu décrits jusqu’alors. Une expérience a été réalisée sur douze chèvres laitières canulées recevant un régime riche en concentré, afin de mettre en évidence ces épisodes et leurs conséquences sur la production et le comportement des animaux. Pour cela, des mesures quotidiennes d’ingestion et de production ainsi que des mesures en continu d’ingestion, de mastication et de pH ont été réalisées. La modélisation des épisodes d’acidose a permis de montrer qu’ils se caractérisent par une chute brutale de pH ruminal, suivie d’une chute d’ingestion, puis d’une chute de production laitière. La chute de pH ruminal est suivie d’une période pendant laquelle le pH est relativement élevé, puis d’un lent retour à la normale. Ces épisodes peuvent avoir des conséquences sur l’ingestion et la production laitière pendant plus de trois semaines. La modélisation de l’ingestion, grâce au développement d’une méthode d’analyse par segmentation / classification a permis de montrer que les épisodes d’acidose s’accompagnent d’une désorganisation de l’ingestion. En particulier, le temps passé à ingérer rapidement diminue au profit de celui passé à ingérer lentement. L’analyse simultanée des cinétiques d’ingestion, de rumination et de pH ruminal a ensuite montré que cette désorganisation du comportement d’ingestion entraînait une désorganisation du comportement de rumination. Ces phénomènes sont associés à une stabilisation de la cinétique de pH ruminal qui reste toujours au-dessus du seuil de 6,0.",['sdv']
"Messi, Ronaldo, and the Politics of Celebrity Elections: Voting for the Best Soccer Player in the World","It is widely assumed that celebrities are imbued with political capital and the power to move opinion. To understand the sources of that capital in the specific domain of sports celebrity, we investigate the popularity of global soccer superstars. Specifically, we examine players’ success in the Ballon d’Or—the most high-profile contest to select the world’s best player. Based on historical election results as well as an original survey of soccer fans, we find that certain kinds of players are significantly more likely to win the Ballon d’Or. Moreover, we detect an increasing concentration of votes on these kinds of players over time, suggesting a clear and growing hierarchy in the competition for soccer celebrity. Further analyses of support for the world’s two best players in 2016 (Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) show that, if properly adapted, political science concepts like partisanship have conceptual and empirical leverage in ostensibly non-political contests.",['shs']

Agricultural policies in France : from EU regulation to national design,"Within its research on the agricultural policy changes in Poland, the Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics (IERiGZ) in Warsaw, Poland, is conducting a programme aiming at identifying the possibilities to design a national agricultural policy compliant with the CAP requirements. In order to successfully design the best suitable policy, a specific attention is paid on experiences and lessons from other Member States. For that purpose, IERiGZ asked experts from some Member States to provide relevant expertises targeting the national options chosen to implement the CAP (including rural development policy), considering not only the means but also financing resources and procedures to achieve the national agricultural goals. The present document finds its roots within this scope and thus presents the French way EU agricultural policies have been, are, and will be, implemented. For a better understanding a review of the CAP foundations is firstly provided in order to address the historic issues of the evolution of European agricultural policies. Then, main agricultural highlights of the French situation are briefly depicted, in order to better frame the two head points that are the French translation of markets policy on the one hand and of rural development on the other hand. Both issues are policy-oriented and sketches of national underlying strategies are given whenever the available data were relevant enough.",['sdv']

Dans quelles conditions de disponibilité en herbe est-il nécessaire de complémenter en énergie la jument en lactation au pâturage ?,"Our study investigated the effects of daily herbage allowance (DHA) and energy supplementation on daily herbage intake in lactating saddle mares grazing high-quality regrowths. Three contrasting DHAs at ground level: low, medium and high, i.e. 35, 52.5 and 70 g DM.kg BW-1.d-1, were obtained by adjusting pasture strip width. For 3 successive 2-week periods, 3 groups of 3 supplemented mares (S, 2.6 kg DM barley.d-1) and 3 groups of 3 non supplemented mares (NS) grazed each DHA according to a Latin-square design. Whichever their level of supplementation, all the mares responded in the same way to DHA variations by linearly increasing their herbage intake from 18.5 to 23.4 g DM.kg BW-1.d-1 with increasing DHA. However, barley supplementation allowed to S mares to realize total digestible dry matter intake and net energy intake higher than the ones of NS mares. Contrary to S mares, NS mares no longer met their energy requirements on low and medium DHA. The linear relation between DHA and herbage intake allowed to estimate at 66 g DM.kg BW-1.d-1 (i.e. 39 kg DM.mare-1.d-1) the DHA threshold below which lactating mares need an energy supplementation to fully meet their requirements in our grazing conditions.Notre étude a analysé les effets de la quantité d‟herbe offerte (QO) et de la complémentation énergétique sur l‟ingestion d‟herbe de juments de selle en lactation pâturant des repousses de bonne qualité. Trois niveaux de QO au ras du sol : bas, moyen et haut, i.e. 35, 52,5 et 70 g MS.kg PV-1.j-1, ont été testés en ajustant la surface offerte au fil. Pendant 3 périodes de 2 semaines, 3 groupes de 3 juments complémentées (C, 2,6 kg MS orge.j-1) et 3 groupes de 3 juments non complémentées (NC) ont pâturé chaque QO selon un carré latin.

Innovative markets for sustainable agriculture,"Between 2013 and 2015, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) undertook a survey of innovative approaches that enable markets to act as incentives in the transition towards sustainable agriculture in developing countries. Through a competitive selection process, 15 cases from around the world provide insights into how small-scale initiatives that use sustainable production practices are supported by market demand, and create innovations in the institutions that govern sustainable practices and market exchanges. These cases respond to both local and distant consumers’ concerns about the quality of the food that they eat. The book evidences that the initiatives rely upon social values (e.g. trustworthiness, health [nutrition and food safety], food sovereignty, promotion of youth and rural development, farmer and community livelihoods) to adapt sustainable practices to local contexts, while creating new market outlets for food products. Specifically, private sector and civil society actors are leading partnerships with the public sector to build market infrastructure, integrate sustainable agriculture into private and public education and extension programmes, and ensure the exchange of transparent information about market opportunities. The results are: (i) system innovations that allow new rules for marketing and assuring the sustainable qualities of products; (ii) new forms of organization that permit actors to play multiple roles in the food system (e.g. farmer and auditor, farmer and researcher, consumer and auditor, consumer and intermediary); (iii) new forms of market exchange, such as box schemes, university kiosks, public procurement or systems of seed exchanges; and (iv) new technologies for sustainable agriculture (e.g. effective micro-organisms, biopesticides and soil analysis techniques). The public sector plays a key role in providing legitimate political and physical spaces for multiple actors to jointly create and share sustainable agricultural knowledge, practices and products.",['sdv']
"Scientific opinion on flavouring group evaluation 226 revision 1 (FGE.226Rev1): Consideration of genotoxicity data on one α,β‐unsaturated aldehyde from chemical subgroup 1.1.1(b) of FGE.19","The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids was requested to evaluate the genotoxic potential of one flavouring substance from subgroup 1.1.1(b) of FGE. 19 in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 226 (FGE. 226). The flavour industry provided genotoxicity studies for the substance 4,5-epoxydec-2(trans)-enal [FL-no: 16.071]. Based on these data, the Panel concluded in FGE. 226 that 4,5-epoxydec-2(trans)-enal did not induce gene mutations in bacterial cells but was positive in an in vitro micronucleus assay, so, 4,5-epoxydec-2(trans)-enal is considered an in vitro genotoxic agent. The negative results obtained in an in vivo micronucleus assay cannot overrule the positive results of the in vitro micronucleus assay with and without S9-mix due to the lack of demonstration of bone marrow exposure. Following this, the flavour industry has provided plasma analysis of a satellite group of rats treated with 4,5-epoxydec-2(trans)-enal in order to investigate the systemic exposure of animals in the in vivo micronucleus assay. However, the plasma analysis did not provide enough evidence of target tissue exposure. An in vivo Comet assay in rodents was recommended in FGE. 226, in order to investigate possible genotoxic effects at the first site of contact (e.g. stomach/duodenum cells) and in the liver. An in vivo Comet assay in liver and duodenum was provided that suggests that 4,5-epoxydec-2(trans)-enal [FL-no: 16.071] did not induce DNA damage in the duodenum of rats. However, the genotoxic effect observed in vitro was confirmed in the in vivo Comet assay in the liver of rats. The Panel concluded that 4,5-epoxydec-2(trans)-enal [FL-no: 16.071] does raise a safety concern with respect to genotoxicity and, therefore, it cannot be evaluated according to the Procedure.",['sdv']
"Safety evaluation of the food enzyme endo‐1,4‐beta‐xylanase from genetically modified Aspergillus niger strain XYL","The food enzyme considered in this opinion is an endo-1,4-b-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) produced with a genetically modified strain of Aspergillus niger. The genetic modifications do not give rise to safety concerns. The food enzyme contains neither the production organism nor recombinant DNA. The endo-1,4-beta-xylanase is intended to be used in baking processes. Based on the maximum use levels recommended for the respective food process, dietary exposure to the food enzyme-total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of individual data from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. This exposure estimate is below 0.013 mg TOS/kg body weight (bw) per day in European populations. No safety concerns were identified in relation to the genetic modifications performed, the manufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided, allergenicity and exposure assessments. The allergenicity was evaluated by comparing the amino acid sequence to those of known allergens; no match was found. The Panel considered that the likelihood of allergic reactions to dietary intake of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase is low and, therefore, does not give rise to safety concerns. The systemic toxicity was assessed by means of a repeated dose 90-day oral toxicity study in rodents. A no observed adverse effect level was derived (4,095 and 4,457 mg TOS/kg bw per day for males and females, respectively), which, compared with the dietary exposure, results in a sufficiently high margin of exposure. However, the genotoxicity data were incomplete. Due to the absence of the recommended combination of microbial strains used in the Ames test (i.e. lack of Salmonella Typhimurium TA102 and Escherichia coli WP2), no conclusions can be drawn on potential DNA oxidising or cross-linking mechanisms giving rise to gene mutations. Consequently, no final conclusions can be drawn on genotoxicity.",['sdv']

None of the 53 substances was considered to have genotoxic potential. The substances were evaluated through a stepwise approach that integrates information on the structure-activity relationships, intake from current uses, toxicological threshold of concern (TTC), and available data on metabolism and toxicity. The Panel concluded that all 53 substances do not give rise to safety concerns at their levels of dietary intake, estimated on the basis of the 'Maximised Survey-derived Daily Intake' (MSDI) approach. Besides the safety assessment of the flavouring substances, the specifications for the materials of commerce have also been considered and found adequate. For 50 substances, further information is required based on comparison of the 'modified Theoretical Added Maximum Daily Intakes' (mTAMDIs) with the TTCs.

"Safety assessment of the substance phosphorous acid, mixed 2,4‐bis(1,1‐dimethylpropyl)phenyl and 4‐(1,1‐dimethylpropyl)phenyl triesters for use in food contact materials","This scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of the substance phosphorous acid, mixed 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylpropyl) phenyl and 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl) phenyl triesters. The substance was evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2011 and 2,4-di-tert-amylphenol, an impurity and hydrolysis product was re-evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2015. In this application, the applicant requested an increase of the specific migration limit of the substance, currently established at 5 mg/kg food, to 10 mg/kg food, and provided new toxicological studies. Findings from three new in vitro mutagenicity assays on the oxidation products support the conclusion from 2011 that the substance and its oxidation products are not genotoxic. A new toxicokinetic study on the substance supports the consideration from the evaluation in 2011 that the substance does not raise concern for accumulation. The outcome of a new delayed neurotoxicity study on a structurally related substance, phosphorous acid, tris (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) ester, which was considered not to cause neurotoxicity in hens, strengthens the conclusion of the Panel in 2011 that the substance does not represent a concern for neurotoxicity. From a new two-generation reproduction toxicity study and a prenatal developmental toxicity study on the substance, a new subchronic toxicity study on its oxidation products that completes the one submitted in 2011 on the substance itself, and a 2-year oral toxicity study on the structurally related substance, the lowest NOAEL was 58-147 mg/kg bw per day (from the 2-year oral toxicity study). Compared to the requested increase of the migration limit, this gives an acceptable margin of safety of 348. Therefore, the CEF Panel concluded that an increase of the specific migration limit of the substance from 5 to 10 mg/kg food is not a safety concern for the consumer.",['sdv']
Safety evaluation of the food enzyme beta‐amylase obtained from soybean (Glycine max),"The food enzyme considered in this opinion is a beta-amylase (EC 3.2.1.2) from soybean submitted by Nagase (Europa) GmbH. This beta-amylase is intended to be used in the starch processing for maltose syrup production and the manufacture of a Japanese rice cake type. Based on the maximum use levels recommended for the respective food processes, dietary exposure to the food enzyme-total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of Japanese consumption data. Conservative average infant formula consumption, as reported in the EFSA Draft Guidance on risk assessment of substances present in food intended for infants below 16 weeks of age, was used to estimate the exposure to a fraction of soybean comparable to the food enzyme-TOS, resulting from the consumption of soybeanderived foods. The exposure estimate to the food enzyme-TOS was found to be lower than the comparable fraction from the source material. Potential allergenicity of the beta-amylase was evaluated by searching for similarity of the amino acid sequence to those of known allergens, and no match was found. The b-amylase is produced from soybean, which is a known allergenic food. Japanese rice cake, consequently, may contain traces of soybean allergens, which may give rise to safety concerns in soybean-allergic consumers. Based on the origin of the food enzyme from edible parts of soybean, the manufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided and the dietary intake estimates, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use, except that Japanese rice cake produced with this food enzyme may contain traces of soybean allergens.",['sdv']

Safety assessment of the substance dimethyl carbonate for use in food contact materials,"This scientific opinion of the EFSA Panelon Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of dimethyl carbonate used as monomer for making a polycarbonate prepolymer with 1,6-hexanediol and then reacted with 4,4-methylenediphenyldiisocyanate (MDI) and diols, such as polypropylene glycol and 1,4-butanediol, to form a thermoplastic polyurethane containing 29% of the polycarbonate prepolymer. This polymer is intended for repeated use articles with short-term contact (30min) at room temperature for types of food, simulated by 10% ethanol and 3% acetic acid. In the third migration test performed at 40 degrees C during 30min, overall migration was below 2mg/dm(2). Complete migration of the residual dimethyl carbonate would have amounted to less than 1.5g/kg food. The migration of two cyclic hexanediol carbonate oligomers was below 50g/kg food when determined by the third migration test; that of all others was below 1g/kg food. Three invitro genotoxicity studies performed in accordance with OECD Guidelines and covering the three endpoints gene mutation, structural and numerical aberrations were provided and were considered negative by the CEF Panel. The oligomers detected by the migration tests are formed from dimethyl carbonate and 1,6-hexanediol (FCM ref No1067) do not give rise to concern for genotoxicity. The CEF Panelconcluded that the use of dimethyl carbonate does not raise safety concern in the application described above. It is aware that dimethyl carbonate may be used for other polycarbonates and/or under other conditions. These are likely to result in different migrates which need to be evaluated by the business operators. In such cases, the migration of dimethyl carbonate and the total polycarbonate oligomers below 1,000Da is of no safety concern, if each of them does not exceed 0.05mg/kg food.",['sdv']
"Safety assessment of the substance 1,2,3,4‐tetrahydronaphthalene‐2,6‐dicarboxylic acid, dimethyl ester for use in food contact materials","This scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene2,6- dicarboxylic acid, dimethyl ester (TDCM) for use as a co-monomer to manufacture polyester layers. The polyester layer is not intended to be in direct contact with food. The finished multilayer articles are intended for packaging aqueous, acidic and low alcoholic foodstuffs. Contact conditions include sterilisation followed by long-term storage at room temperature. No thermal degradation of TDCM is expected during the manufacture of the middle polyester layer and of the multilayer articles. Total mass transfer of the substance from a polyester monolayer was calculated to be up to 0.032 mg/kg food. Based on three in vitro genotoxicity tests, the CEF Panel considered that the substance does not raise concern for genotoxicity. When tested behind a polypropylene layer, migrating TDCM-related oligomers, their oxidation products and other related reaction products were identified. The major components were TDCM dimers. When tested behind a cyclo-olefin polymer layer, none of the TDCMrelated substances were found to migrate. Based on the lack of genotoxicity of the co-monomer, the ester nature of the oligomers and on (quantitative) structure-activity relationship ((Q) SAR) analysis, the CEF Panel considered that there is no indication of genotoxicity for the oligomers, their oxidation products and other TDCM-related reaction products. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance is not of safety concern for the consumer if used as a co-monomer for the manufacture of a polyester layer intended to be used as an inner (non-food contact) layer of a multilayer material for contact with foods simulated by simulants A, B, C, D1 (as set in Regulation (EU) 10/2011). The migration of the sum of the substance and the dimers (cyclic and open chain) should not exceed 0.05 mg/kg food.",['sdv']
"Scientific opinion on flavouring group evaluation 208 revision 2 (FGE.208Rev2): Consideration of genotoxicity data on alicyclic aldehydes with α,β‐unsaturation in ring/side‐chain and precursors from chemical subgroup 2.2 of FGE.19","The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) was requested to evaluate the genotoxic potential of flavouring substances from subgroup 2.2 of FGE. 19 in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 208 Revision 2 (FGE. 208Rev2). In FGE. 208Rev1, the CEF Panel evaluated genotoxicity studies on p-mentha-1,8-dien-7-al [FL-no: 05.117], the representative substance for FGE. 19 subgroup 2.2. The Comet assay performed in liver showed a positive result, and therefore, the Panel concluded that p-mentha-1,8-dien-7-al [FL-no: 05.117] is genotoxic in vivo and that, accordingly, there is a safety concern for its use as flavouring substance. Since p-mentha-1,8-dien-7-al [FL-no: 05.117] is representative for the nine remaining substances of subgroup 2.2 (p-mentha-1,8-dien-7-ol [FL-no: 02.060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02.091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05.106], 2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1carboxaldehyde [FL-no: 05.121], myrtenyl formate [FL-no: 09.272], p-mentha-1,8-dien-7-yl acetate [FL-no: 09.278], myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09.302], myrtenyl-2-methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09.899] and myrtenyl-3-methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09.900]), the Panel concluded in the previous revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208Rev1) that there is a potential safety concern for these substances. Subsequently, the industry has submitted genotoxicity studies on five substances of FGE. 19 subgroup 2.2: p-mentha-1,8-dien-7-ol [FL-no: 02.060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02.091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05.106], p-mentha-1,8-dien-7-yl acetate [FL-no: 09.278] and myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09.302], which are evaluated in the present revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208Rev2). The Panel concluded that the concern for genotoxicity could be ruled out for p-mentha-1,8-dien-7-ol [FL-no: 02.060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02.091], p-mentha-1,8-dien-7-yl acetate [FLno: 09.278] and myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09.302], which will be evaluated through the Procedure. Genotoxicity data on myrtenal [FL-no: 05.106] were considered equivocal, therefore, it cannot be evaluated through the Procedure, presently. p-Mentha-1,8-dien-7-al [FL-no: 05.117] and four substances not supported by industry (2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-carboxaldehyde [FL-no: 05.121], myrtenyl formate [FL-no: 09.272], myrtenyl-2-methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09.899] and myrtenyl-3methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09.900]) have been deleted from the Union List.",['sdv']
"Scientific opinion on flavouring group evaluation 302 (FGE.302): N‐(2‐methylcyclohexyl)‐2,3,4,5,6‐pentafluoro‐benzamide from Chemical Group 30","The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids was requested to evaluate N-(2-methylcyclohexyl)-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoro-benzamide [FL-no: 16.119] in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 302, using the Procedure in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1565/2000. The substance is intended to be used as a flavour modifier and the current evaluation is only applicable to this use. Information on the ratios of diastereoisomers of the substance has been provided (cis 20-40% and trans 60-80%). Information on the ratio of enantiomers is lacking. The available data on genotoxicity do not preclude the evaluation of the candidate substance [FL-no: 16.119] through the Procedure. The substance was evaluated through the B-side of the Procedure. A 'No Observed Adverse Effect Level' (NOAEL) of 55 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day could be derived for [FL-no: 16.119] from a 90-day subchronic toxicity study in rats. This NOAEL provides an adequate margin of safety of 1.4 x 10(6), based on the 'Maximised Survey-Derived Daily Intake' (MSDI) of 2.4 mu g/capita per day. Based on the 'modified Theoretical Added Maximum Daily Intake' (mTAMDI) approach, the Panel concluded that more information is needed on use and use levels. Besides the safety assessment of this flavouring substance, the specifications for the material of commerce have also been considered.

Phyto-evaluation of Cd-Pb Using Tropical Plants in Soil-Leachate Conditions,"Sources of soil contamination can exist in various types of conditions including in the form of semifluids. In this study, 3 different types of tropical plants, Acacia (Acacia mangium Willd), Mucuna (Mucuna bracteata DC. ex Kurz) and Vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides L. Nash), were tested under different levels of soil-leachate conditions. The relative growth rate, metal tolerance, and phytoassessment of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) accumulation in the roots and shoots were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Tolerance index, translocation factor, metal accumulation ratio, and percentage metal efficacy were applied to assess the metal translocation ability among all the 3 types of plants. Significantly higher (P < .05) accumulation of Cd and Pb was exhibited in the roots and shoots of all 3 plants growing under the soil-leachate conditions. However, negative growth performance and plant withering were observed in both Acacia and Mucuna with increased application of higher soil-leachate levels. Vetiver accumulated remarkably higher total concentration of Cd (116.16-141.51 mg/kg) and Pb (156.37-365.27 mg/kg) compared with both Acacia and Mucuna. The overall accumulation trend of Cd and Pb in the 3 plants growing under the soil-leachate conditions was in the order of Vetiver > Acacia > Mucuna. The findings of the study suggest that Vetiver has great potential as Cd and Pb phytoremediator in soil-leachate conditions.","['sdv', 'sde']"

Valuation Using Industry Multiples: How to Choose the Most Relevant Multiples,"Our research focuses specifically on the methodology to be applied to improve the relevance of the multiples-based valuation method regarding the identification of the most relevant multiples (i.e., that reduce the relative absolute valuation error within any industry-based peer group). In line with prior empirical studies, our results confirm that Enterprise Value multiples based on EBIT and EBITDA perform better, compared to Sales and Capital Employed, and that multiples based on forward-looking EBIT and EBITDA are more relevant compared to corresponding actual earnings. In the absence of forward-looking earnings, available at the date of valuation, our study shows that EBITDA multiples provide better estimates than EBIT multiples do. Beyond these general results, the approach implemented in our research can be easily reproduced by practitioners (e.g., financial analysts, M&A advisors, independent appraisers) to identify case-by-case the multiples that are the most relevant within any industry-based peer group.",['shs']
Increase in relative deposition of fine particles in the rat lung periphery in the absence of gravity,"While it is well recognizedthat pulmonary deposition of inhaled particles is lowered in microgravity(G) compared with gravity on the ground (1G), theabsence of sedimentation causes fine particles to penetrate deeperin the lung in G. Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), we determined the effect of gravity on peripheral deposition(DEPperipheral) of fine particles. Aerosolized 0.95-m-diameter ferricoxide particles were delivered to spontaneously breathing rats placedin plethysmographic chambers both in G aboard the NASA MicrogravityResearch Aircraft and at 1G. Following exposure, lungs wereperfusion fixed, fluid filled, and imaged in a 3T MR scanner. The MRsignal decay rate, R2*, was measured in each voxel of the left lungfrom which particle deposition (DEP) was determined based on acalibration curve. Regional deposition was assessed by comparingDEP between the outer (DEPperipheral) and inner (DEPcentral) areas oneach slice, and expressed as the central-to-peripheral ratio. Total lungdeposition tended to be lower in G compared with 1G (1.01 0.52vs. 1.43 0.52 g/ml, P 0.1). In G, DEPperipheral was larger thanDEPcentral (P 0.03), while, in 1G, DEPperipheral was not significantlydifferent from DEPcentral. Finally, central-to-peripheral ratio was significantlyless in G than in 1G (P 0.05). These data show a largerfraction of fine particles depositing peripherally in G than in 1G,likely beyond the large- and medium-sized airways. Although notmeasured, the difference in the spatial distribution of depositedparticles between G and 1G could also affect particle retention rates,with an increase in retention for particles deposited more peripherally.",['spi']
Finding the best management policy to eradicate invasive species from spatial ecological networks with simultaneous actions,"1. Spatial management of invasive species is more likely to be successful when multiple locations are treated simultaneously. However, selecting the best locations to act is difficult due to the many options available at any time. 2. We design a near-optimal policy for applying multiple actions simultaneously for faster invasive species control within a network. Our method uses a recent optimisation tool, the graph-based Markov decision process (GMDP). Since the policy can be difficult to interpret, we extracted a simpler policy using classification trees. We applied our approach to the eradication of invasive mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki from the habitat of the red-finned blueeye Scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis, a critically endangered fish with a global population that is restricted to seven artesian springs in Queensland, Australia. 3. The policy returned by the GMDP was to manage springs occupied by mosquitofish and their connected neighbours, unless the neighbours were occupied by red-finned blue-eyes. 4. Simultaneous management resulted in rapid declines in simulated mosquitofish occupancy even if eradication effectiveness was low; however, the cost of simultaneous eradication was high and sustained eradication effort was necessary to maintain low mosquitofish occupancy. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our paper finds a near-optimal, multi-action control policy to remove an invasive species from a multi-species spatial network. We introduce the graphbased Markov decision process and apply it to a real case study – eradication of invasive mosquitofish from the habitat of the red-finned blue-eye. We find that the graph-based Markov decision process can generate policies for networks with extremely large state spaces; however, it works best when nodes have fewer than five neighbours. We conclude that simultaneous eradications are effective for rapid control of invasive species; however, managers should consider the cost and time required for an effective eradication program.",['sde']
Digital technology to support students' socio-scientific reasoning about environmental issues,"Scientific expertise and outcomes often give rise to controversy. An educational response that equips students to take part in such discussions is the teaching of Socially Acute Questions (SAQs). With SAQs, the understanding of uncertainty, risk and how knowledge is developed, is central. We explore the way in which students from different disciplines and different continents are brought together via a digital platform to explore SAQs about environmental issues (a green algae outbreak linked to release of fertilizers along the coast of Brittany, the construction of a desalination plant near Melbourne to produce fresh water, and the changes in meat consumption on a global scale, with regard to population projections in 2050). We have developed frameworks for looking at the quality of the collective reasoning and at the nature of students’ interactions, so that we analyze the organization of the learning communities and the building of collegial expertise. Our results show that interdisciplinary discussions – especially on an international scale – foster the understanding of complex situations. In this paper, we discuss the modalities of one didactic scenario to enhance critical thinking and collaborative work, and to provide space for learners to support argumentation.",['shs']
Damage Analysis of a Ferritic SiMo Ductile Cast Iron Submitted to Tension and Compression Loadings in Temperature,"Tensile and compression tests were carried out on a ductile cast iron for temperatures up to 1073 K. The damage caused inside and around graphite nodules was evaluated as a function of the local equivalent plastic strain by using microstructural quantifications. The mechanical properties are strongly dependent on a temperature above 773 K. Concerning tensile behavior, an evolutional law issued from the Gurson model representing the void growth as a function of the deformation and temperature was successfully employed. It is demonstrated that the strain state and the temperature have a strong influence on the void growth function. In the case of compression tests, the temperature has a weak influence on the nodule deformation for temperatures lower than 773 K, and the mechanical behavior is driven by the viscoplastic properties of the ferrite. For higher temperatures, the mechanical properties in compression are progressively modified, since graphite nodules tend to remain spherical, and ferrite grains are severely deformed. A synthesis of the damage mechanisms is proposed in the studied range of temperature and plastic strain. It appears that the graphite nodule aspect ratio can be used as an indicator of the deformation under compression loading for temperatures ranging from room temperature to 673 K.","['chim', 'spi']"

Colloidal crystal ordering in a liquid crystal,"Nanoparticles (NPs) can now be synthesized with a wide array of controlled sizes, shapes, and properties. However, turning them into nanomaterials often requires packing them into ordered assemblies to manifest specific electronic or optical properties for applications in nanoelectronics, optics, and metamaterials. Colloidal self-assembly (1) of NPs is relatively simple but is often restricted to high-symmetry crystals by the lack of specific directional bonds, especially for dilute NP solutions. To obtain lower symmetries that confer useful optical or electronic properties, long-range directional interactions must be imparted. On page 69 of this issue, Mundoor et al. (2) make clever use of an anisotropic host fluid, a liquid crystal, to promote the formation of a low-symmetry crystal in a dilute dispersion of nanorods.","['spi', 'phys']"
Modelling of interband transitions in GaAs tunnel diode,"In this paper, an improved model for non-local band-to-band tunneling carrier transport is presented and compared to experimental measurement from GaAs tunnel junctions devices. By carefully taking into account the coupling between the conduction band and the light holes valence band, the model is able to predict, with realistic material parameters, the amplitude of the current density throughout the whole tunneling regime. The model suggests that elastic band-to-band tunneling instead of trap-assisted-tunneling is the predominant mechanism in GaAs tunnel junctions, which is of great interest for better understanding and improving III–V multijunction solar cells.",['spi']
Northeasternmost record of a North Pacific fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea,"Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the North Pacific consistently range as far north as the Bering Sea. While occasional sightings of fin whales occur north of the Bering Strait, they are rarely documented north of 67°N. However, a recent increase in passive acoustic monitoring has shown that fin whales are more prevalent in the Chukchi Sea than previously thought. During a 2012 field survey in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea, fin whale calls were detected on a DiFAR sonobuoy deployed at 71.575°N, 157.823°W, 50 km off Barrow near the mouth of Barrow Canyon. On August 27, 2012, approximately 30 fin whale downsweep calls were detected over an hour and a half, at bearings of approximately 270–290° from the sonobuoy. Since only one sonobuoy was deployed, in situ localization of the calls was not possible. Post hoc range estimates using a combination of modal dispersion techniques, nonlinear time-domain warping, and geoacoustic inversion resulted in a source range estimate of less than 5 km. This location is approximately 280 and 365 km northeast of the previous closest acoustic detection and confirmed visual sighting of a fin whale, respectively. These results represent the farthest northeast record of fin whale calls in the Alaskan Arctic and illustrate the importance of continued passive acoustic monitoring in a rapidly changing environment.","['spi', 'phys']"
The carbazole-bound ferrocenium salt as a specific cationic photoinitiator upon near-UV and visible LEDs (365–405 nm),"A carbazole-bound ferrocenium salt [i.e., (η6-Carbazole) (η5-cyclopentadienyl) iron hexafluorophosphate—FS] is proposed as an efficient photoinitiator for the cationic ring-opening polymerization of epoxides under air upon the exposure to a near-UV LED at 385 nm or a visible LED at 405 nm. When using this ferrocenium salt FS (0.2 wt%)/diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate or FS (0.2 wt%)/diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate/N-vinylcarbazole, final epoxide conversions of 55–66 % can be obtained after 800 s of irradiation at 385 or 405 nm. Reference cationic photoinitiators (i.e., diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate; 9-(4-hydroxyethoxyphenyl) thianthrenium hexafluorophosphate and triphenylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate) are unable to initiate the epoxide polymerization under the same conditions. The photochemical mechanisms for the formation of the initiating species are studied using steady-state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis and electron spin resonance spin-trapping techniques. Molecular orbital calculations help to describe the absorption properties and the initiation step. The performance attained when using FS alone is really promising for applications under soft near-UV or visible light-emitting diode irradiation.",['chim']
Functional Integration on Paracompact Manifods,"In 1948 Feynman introduced functional integration. Long ago the problematic aspect of measures in the space of fields was overcome with the introduction of volume elements in Probability Space, leading to stochastic formulations. More recently Cartier and DeWitt-Morette (CDWM) focused on the definition of a proper integration measure and established a rigorous mathematical formulation of functional integration. CDWM’s central observation relates to the distributional nature of fields, for it leads to the identification of distribution functionals with Schwartz space test functions as density measures. This is just the mathematical content of the Taylor-Lagrange Scheme (TLRS) developed by the authors in a recent past. In this scheme fields are living in metric Schwartz-Sobolev spaces, subject to open coverings with subordinate partition-of-unity (PU) test functions. In effect these PU, through the convolution operation, lead to smooth C ∞ field functions on an extended Schwartz space. Thereby, first, the basic assumption of differential geometry -that fields live on differentiable manifolds- is validated. And, second, we show that it is just the notion of convolution in the theory of distributions which leads to a sound definition of CDWM’s Laplace-Stieltjes transform, stemming from the existence of an isometry invariant Hausdorff measure in the space of fields. In gauge theories the construction of C ∞ smooth vector fields on a curved manifold is established, as required for differentiable vector fibre bundles. The choice of a connection on a principal bundle P is discussed for pure Abelian and Yang-Mills cases in relation with the presence of PU test-functions. A connection on P being a unique separation of the tangent space TuP into vertical and horizontal sub-spaces, it further separates in the functional Hausdorff integration measure a finite Gaussian integration over the gauge parameter which factors out and plays no physical role. For non-Abelian SU (2) and SU (3) Yang-Mills gauge theories the properties of the Vilkowisky-DeWitt connection and of the Landau-DeWitt covariant back-ground gauge result in very simple calculation rules.","['math', 'phys']"

Multiphysics Simulation and Experimental Investigation of Aluminum Wettability on a Titanium Substrate for Laser Welding-Brazing Process,"The control of metal wettability is a key-factor in the field of brazing or welding-brazing. The present paper deals with the numerical simulation of the whole phenomena occurring during the assembly of dissimilar alloys. The study is realized in the frame of potential applications for the aircraft industry, considering the case of the welding-brazing of aluminum Al5754 and quasi-pure titanium Ti40. The assembly configuration, presented here, is a simplification of the real experiment. We have reduced the three-dimensional overlap configuration to a bi-dimensional case. In the present case, an aluminum cylinder is fused onto a titanium substrate. The main physical phenomena which are considered here are: the heat transfers, the fluid flows with free boundaries and the mass transfer in terms of chemical species diffusion. The numerical problem is implemented with the commercial software Comsol Multiphysics™, by coupling heat equation, Navier-Stokes and continuity equations and the free boundary motion. The latter is treated with the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method, with a particular focus on the contact angle implementation. The comparison between numerical and experimental results shows a very satisfactory agreement in terms of droplet shape, thermal field and intermetallic layer thickness.

Analytical and numerical study based on experimental investigation of different curved sandwich composites manufactured by filament winding process,"Sandwich structures, due to their high stiffness versus lightness ratio, are used progressively in high performance products. In order to design these structures with the most appropriate dimensions and material combinations, relevant mechanical properties must be well understood. This work aims to estimate the elastic properties of composite sandwiches from a curved structure taking into account the manufacturing process. In the case of filament winding process, specimens are necessarily cylindrical or barrel extracted. In our case, these types of structures are tested in 3- and 4-point bending to analyze their behavior experimentally using predictive models and design rules. Different conEgurations are adopted for bending tests to analyze and discuss global mechanical behavior. Furthermore, the acoustic emission technique is used to detect the initial appearance of damage mechanisms and to examine their evolution in terms of amplitude peaks and localization. Finally, a correlation between these acoustic emission signals and the damage initiation mechanisms is proposed, considering their effects on the mechanical behavior of each tested material.",['spi']
Divergent evolution of duplicate genes leads to genetic incompatibilities within A. thaliana,"Genetic incompatibilities resulting from interactions between two loci represent a potential source of postzygotic barriers and may be an important factor in evolution when they impair the outcome of interspecific crosses. We show that, in crosses between strains of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, loci interact epistatically, controlling a recessive embryo lethality. This interaction is explained by divergent evolution occurring among paralogs of an essential duplicate gene, for which the functional copy is not located at the same locus in different accessions. These paralogs demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in their respective evolutionary trajectories, which results in widespread incompatibility among strains. Our data suggest that these passive mechanisms, gene duplication and extinction, could represent an important source of genetic incompatibilities across all taxa.",['sdv']
Sliding Modes based Nonlinear PID Controller for Quadrotor: Theory and Experiment,"In this paper, a Nonlinear PID (NLPID) control design is proposed. The main idea consists of combining theclassical sliding modes approach together with the PID structure. Unlike the existing nonlinear PIDcontrollers in the literature, the coefficients are constant parameters in this work. Within this paper, weinvestigate the efficiency and the performance of this technique through an application to a small VerticalTake Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The NLPID based autopilot drives thevehicle toward the desired configuration in the space while stabilizing the roll and the pitch angles wherethe closed-loop system stability analysis is highlighted. The numerical simulations have shown satisfactoryresults using nominal model or disturbed one compared to the use of classic sliding modes technique only.Experimental tests are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.",['spi']
Logical Detection of Invalid SameAs Statements in RDF Data,"In the last years, thanks to the standardization of Semantic Web technologies, we are experiencing an unprecedented production of data, published online as Linked Data. In this context, when a typed link is instantiated between two different resources referring to the same real world entity, the usage of owl:sameAs is generally predominant. However, recent research discussions within the Linked Data community have shown issues in the use of owl:sameAs. Problems arise both in cases in which sameAs is automatically discovered by a data linking tool erroneously, or when users declare it but meaning something less 'strict' than the semantics defined by OWL. In this work, we discuss further this issue and we present a method for logically detect invalid sameAs statements under specific circumstances. We report our experimental results, performed on OAEI datasets, to prove that the approach can be promising.",['info']
"Paleoclimate and Paleoenvironment of Gonghe Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, During the Lastdeglacial: Weathering, Erosion and Vegetation Cover Affect Clay Mineral Formation","With the analysis of the sources and formation mechanism of the clay minerals in the sediment core from the Dalianhai lake in the Gonghe Basin, northeastern Tibet-Qinghai Plateau, clay mineral composition proxies, grain-size and carbonate contents have been employed for high-resolution study in order to reconstruct East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) over the northeastern Tibet-Qinghai Plateau during the lastdeglacial. The study also extended to establish a relationship between vegetation cover changes and erosion during the last 14.5 ka with pollen record and clay mineral proxies. Smectite/kaolinite and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios allow us to assess hydrolysis conditions in lowlands and/or physical erosion process in highlands of the Gonghe Basin. Before 12.9 Cal ka BP, both mineralogical ratios show low values indicative of strong physical erosion in the basin with a dominant cold and dry phase. After 12.9 Cal ka BP, an increase in both mineralogical ratios indicates enhanced chemical weathering in the basin associated with a warm and humid climate. The beginning of Holocene is characterized by high smectite/(illite+chlorite) and smectite/kaolinite ratios that is synchronous as with deposition of many peat laminae, implying the best warm and humid conditions specifically between 8.0 to 5.5 Cal ka BP. The time interval after 5.0 Cal ka BP is characterized by a return to high physical erosion and low chemical weathering with dry climate conditions in the basin. Comparing variations of clay mineral assemblages with previous pollen results, we observe a rapid response in terms of chemical weathering and physical erosion intensity to a modification of the vegetation cover in the basin.",['phys']
Directly Valuing Animal Welfare in (Environmental) Economics,"Research in economics is anthropocentric. It only cares about the welfare of humans, and usually does not concern itself with animals. When it does, animals are treated as resources, biodiversity, or food. That is, animals only have instrumental value for humans. Yet unlike water, trees or vegetables, and like humans, most animals have a brain and a nervous system. They can feel pain and pleasure, and many argue that their welfare should matter. Some economic studies value animal welfare, but only indirectly through humans’ altruistic valuation. This overall position of economics is inconsistent with the utilitarian tradition and can be qualified as speciesist. We suggest that economics should directly value the welfare of sentient animals, at least sometimes. We briefly discuss some possible implications and challenges for (environmental) economics.",['shs']
How to design compelling Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality experience?,"The convergence of technologies currently observed in the field of Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, robotics and consumer electronic reinforces the trend of new applications appearing every day. But when transferring knowledge acquired from research to businesses, research laboratories are often at a loss because of a lack of knowledge of the design and integration processes in creating an industrial scale product. In fact, the innovation approaches that take a good idea from the laboratory to a successful industrial product are often little known to researchers. The objective of this paper is to present the results of the work of several research teams that have finalized a working method for researchers and manufacturers that allow them to design virtual or augmented reality systems and enable their users to enjoy “a compelling Virtual Reality experience”. That approach, called “the I2I method”, present 11 phases from “Establishing technological and competitive intelligence and industrial property” to “Improvements” through the “Definition of the Behavioral Interface, Virtual Environment and Behavioral Software Assistance”. As a result of the experience gained by various research teams, this design approach benefits from contributions from current Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality research. Our objective is to validate and continuously move such multidisciplinary design team methods forward.",['shs']
A New Scheme for Text Line and Character Segmentation from Gray Scale Images of Palm Leaf Manuscript,"Most of text line and character segmentation methods for handwritten document image basically still depend on the binary image of the document. Unfortunately, for palm leaf manuscript images, the binarization process is a real challenge. We proposed a new binarization free scheme for text line and character segmentation for palm leaf manuscript images. Our scheme consists of 4 sub-tasks: brushing character area of gray level images with minimum filtering, average block projection profile of gray level images, selection of candidate area for segmentation path, and construction of nonlinear segmentation path. For evaluation, we compared our method with the shredding method which is applied in three different schemes of experiment. The experimental results showed that the proposed method performed optimal on the palm leaf manuscript images which contain discolored parts, with low intensity variations or poor contrast, random noises, and fading.",['info']
Socio-economic impacts of co-firing in Vietnam: The case of Ninh Binh Coal Power Plant,"Co-firing biomass with coal is a relatively low-cost technology to utilize biomass for electricity production compared to dedicated biomass power plant. Co-firing could help to reduce the negative impact of coal power plants to economy, environment and society. Vietnam has potential to develop co-firing base on the abundant of biomass resources and because Vietnam will continue to build more coal-fired power plant in the next 2 decades as stated in the latest National Power Development Plan. Among the co-firing technologies, direct co-firing is the most suitable for Vietnam context. Despite of low biomass ratio, direct co-firing offers low investment cost and could utilize most of the biomass feedstock. Vietnam has huge biomass potential, especially the agriculture and forestry residues. These biomasses should be considered first as feedstock for co-firing. Biomass pellets is also a good choice in term of technical features and local supply. However, the price of pellets is not yet competitive with coal or agricultural residues. Economic benefit of co-firing would be higher in the plants that has following features: assess to stable biomass supply, biomass price competitive with coal, incentives and support in term of market for renewable energy utilization and waste reduction. Vietnam should start experimenting co-firing in the coal power plants that located in the area where biomass resource is available, easy to collect and deliver to the plant, using imported coal such as Vinh Tan 2, Duyen Hai 1, Long Phuoc 1…; or the plants that are soon or already depreciated such as Ninh Binh, Uong Bi or Pha Lai to utilize the existing infrastructures. The case study of co-firing 5% rice straw with coal in Ninh Binh Coal Power Plant shows that co-firing could bring benefit to the plant owner in the condition that lack supporting mechanism for co-firing as well as with the absent of carbon credit. Farmers and workers that work in biomass supply chain also benefit from co-firing, especially farmers. In addition, co-firing provide significant positive externalities, in which the most notable is health benefit from reducing air-borne pollutants. Greenhouse gas emissions reduction adds a small part to the overall benefit of co-firing.",['shs']
A comprehensive multiscale moisture transport analysis: From porous reference silicates to cement-based materials,"Natural and manufactured disordered systems are ubiquitous and often involve hierarchical structures. This structural organization optimizes defined physical properties at several scales from molecular to representative volumes where the usual homogenization approach becomes efficient. For studying a particular physical property on these systems it is thus required to use a general method of analysis based on the joint application of complementary techniques covering the whole set of time-and length-scales. Here we review a comprehensive multiscale method presented for analyzing the three-dimensional moisture transport in hierarchical porous media such as synthesized reference silicates and cement-based materials. Several techniques (NMR spectroscopy, relaxometry, diffusometry, X-ray micro-tomography, conductivityaEuro broken vertical bar) have been used to evidence the interplay between the different scales involved in this transport process. This method allows answering the general opened questions concerning the scale dependence of such a moisture transport in cement-based materials. We outline the main results of the multiscale techniques applied on reference porous silicates allowing separating the impact of geometry, hydric state and wettability on the moisture transport. Based on this approach, we prove that this transport at micro- and meso-scale is determinant to modify the moisture at macro-scale during setting or for hardened cement-based materials.",['chim']
Creating platforms by hosting rivals,"We explore conditions under which a multiproduct firm can profitably turn itself into a platform by ""hosting rivals,"" i.e. by inviting rivals to sell products or services on top of its core product. Hosting eliminates the additional shopping costs to consumers of buying a specialist rival's competing version of the multiproduct firm's non-core product. On the one hand, this makes it easier for the rival to compete on the non-core product. On the other hand, hosting turns the rival from a pure competitor into a complementor: the value added by its product now helps raise consumer demand for the multi-product firm's core product. As a result, hosting can be both unilaterally profitable for the multi-product firm and jointly profitable for both firms.",['shs']
Prédiction de la qualité de la viande de ruminants,"Meat & Livestock Australia and Meat Standards Australia and INRA have organized an International meeting on Beef and Lamb carcass grading to underpin consumer satisfaction. The 2 day meeting consisted of 19 presentations centred on the theme that modern beef and lamb products must meet the expectations of consumers who purchase red meat to cook it as a meal solution. The focus was based around the Meat Standards Australia (MSA) grading platform which is designed as a sensory or eating quality grading system for underpinning a cooked meal performance that is matched to the occasion and requires no specialist knowledge by the consumer. This workshop unanimously supported the need for evidence based systems to underpin eating quality for lamb and beef in order to keep consumers purchasing products that are higher in price than the white meat competitors. Registrations were received from 80 people covering 17 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Ireland, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States of America) creating a dynamic workshop atmosphere. In order to drive and focus the recommendations which were discussed at the end of the workshop, it was agreed to establish a working group of current collaborating countries that would be open with respect to new partners.Le « Meat Livestock Australia » et l’INRA ont organisé un congrès international sur la prédiction de la qualité sensorielle de la viande bovine et ovine pour le consommateur.

Towards an Ontology for Annotating Degradation Phenomena,"In the field of built heritage, a huge amount of data describes the state of monuments: documentary data (texts, sounds, images) as well as analytic data from sensors, provides historical, archeological and constructive information. These data, produced by experts coming from several fields, are the foundation for the creation of new information through scientific observations. The problem is that these data are not related nor spatialized. Nowadays we are able to generate extreme accurate 3D model with throughout images-based or laser scanner acquisition. However these 3D models do not carry information regarding their morphological complexities. The design of an ontology for the conservation domain seems to be the best solution in order to obtain understandable entities thanks to their own data related between them. This article present the first attempt of a development of a web information system based on spatialized images semantic annotations tool, related to a domain ontology describing knowledge regarding stone degradation phenomena. Our approach is to produce a domain ontology able to document and therefore provide a framework able to help the decision-making process of experts in the cultural heritage conservation domain. The information annotated with the use of this ontology can enrich not only the scientific observations, but also to help to create new knowledge. In this way, it is possible to link and gather quantitative and qualitative aspect into only one information system. We will propose several example and queries able to exploit the reasoning power of the above information system.",['info']
On the damage criteria and their critical values for flowforming of ELI grade Ti64,"Cold flowforming is a chipless forming process that deforms tubular parts by reducing their outer diameter and thickness while increasing their length. It consists of a rotating mandrel and one or more rollers that are translated along the tube axis, thus plastically deforming it. Flowforming of Ti-6Al-4V (also known as Ti64) is of great interest for improving the mechanical properties of the material, such as yield stress and fatigue strength. However this alloy is known to have poor ductility at room temperature. Therefore, flowforming of Ti64 without failure or crack is a great challenge. In this present paper, the authors have attempted to predict the different failure modes occurring during flowforming. An experimental machine has been built at the Center for Material Forming (CEMEF) in order to monitor the force on the single roller, the torque on the mandrel and the actual rotation speed of the roller as well. Numerous flowforming tests have been performed using different processing parameters, such as working depth, roller feed and initial geometry, in order to investigate the critical values which lead to the failure of the flowformed tube. In addition, numerical simulations of the process have been performed using the FORGE FEM solver. The results of the simulations have been used to evaluate the relevance of usual failure criteria (Crockford-Latham, Rice-Tracey and Oyane).",['spi']
Laying the foundations for an information system dedicated to heritage building degradation monitoring based on the 2D/3D semantic annotation of photographs,"In the last decade many 3D digitization techniques have emerged allowing the generation of dense and precise digital representations of historical building. However, regardless their level of geometric accuracy or visual realism, 3D models are not yet fully adapted to the conservation analysis purposes. In fact, even if a 3D model can be considered an efficient way to accurately record the state of a building, its potentiality in terms of semantic annotation and spatial distribution of heterogeneous data still remain almost unexplored today. Since several years, photographs appear to be a flexible and well diffused portable support for the heritage documentation. They are a natural medium to annotate and compare temporal states. Thanks to the recent advances in photogrammetry computer vision and augmented reality, photographs can be also considered as an excellent support for accurate spatial localization. This article presents the first principles for the development of an information system to monitor the historic building degradation based on three main components: a high dynamic range (HDR) imagebased automatic pipeline, an hybrid (2D/3D) semantic annotation method and a domain ontology describing knowledge related to degradation phenomena. The innovative integration of these main components allows us to introduce the notion of ”informative continuum” as a key for interconnecting spatialized and semanticallyenriched photographs to populate a knowledge base on the building degradation. The first steps of this on-going project are illustrated by an experimentation carried out on the Caromb church in the south of France.",['info']
Guidance for the risk assessment of the presence at low level of genetically modified plant material in imported food and feed under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003,"This document provides guidance for the risk assessment under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the unintended, adventitious or technically unavoidable presence in food and feed of low level of genetically modified plant material intended for markets other than in the European Union.

"UV-violet-blue LED induced polymerizations: specific photoinitiating systems at 365, 385, 395 and 405 nm","Two naphthalimide derivatives (DMAENs) containing tertiary amine groups have been designed and synthesized. Upon exposure to near UV and visible LEDs (365 nm–455 nm), they lead to radicals without adding a hydrogen donor and, in combination with 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine, an iodonium salt or N-vinylcarbazole, they produce radicals and cations. Compared to the well-known camphorquinone or bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide photoinitiator, the novel DMAENs containing photoinitiating systems are characterized by a very high reactivity for both the free radical polymerization of acrylates and the cationic polymerization of epoxides. This outstanding performance paves the way for polymerization in soft conditions (e.g. upon LED irradiation). The photochemical mechanisms are studied by Molecular Orbitals MO calculations, steady state photolysis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, electron spin resonance spin trapping and laser flash photolysis techniques.",['chim']
Birth Control in Europe. 19th-21st centuries,"While the notion that any pregnancy must be stoically accepted dominated in Europe until the eighteenth century, birth control spread during the nineteenth century and gradually became a common practice despite opposition from the Church and political authorities. It was actually seen as a means of upward mobility and from the 1960s increasingly as an instrument of freedom. Policies, which had for a long time condemned this evolution, ultimately adapted and contributed to it through the liberalization of contraception.

Characterizing pyroregions in south-eastern FranceCaractérisation de pyrorégions dans le sud-est de la France,"Efficient fire policies may rely on good knowledge of the regional variations of fire activity and of fire drivers. South-eastern France comprises a range of pyroclimates, i.e. regions with contrasted fire activity (from fireprone Mediterranean areas to mountain areas with few fires) and contrasted climate and fire weather. We tested if these pyroclimates also corresponded to specific hierarchy among environmental and human variables which drive fire activity. We used a 1973-2009 georeferenced fire database, and we computed how the landscape compartmentalization, the fuel coverage, the human density and the fire suppression capacity varied at a 2x2 km scale. The first pyroregion regroups two maritime fire-prone mountains (Corsica and the maritime Alps) in which there are no clear limitation to fire activity because of high human activity (i.e. numerous ignitions), no fuel limitation, and no weather limitation. The area is especially fire-prone because the suppression capacity is low to medium, and because the compartmented landscape hinders the activity of firemen. In the second pyroregion (fire-prone Mediterranean plains and foothills), fire activity is neither weather-limited (especially during dry summers) nor fuel-limited. It is clearly controlled by fire suppression which is especially active. In the third pyroregion (cool peri-Mediterranean mountains), fire activity remains low in spite of low fire suppression capacity and high landscape compartmentalization, because human activity is low and fire weather is unfavourable on average. We discuss to which extent the present fire suppression strategy (i.e. fast, hard-hitting initial attack on all fires) is adapted to these different pyroregions. In the fire-prone maritime mountains, it would be useful to increase the fire suppression forces. In fire-prone plains and foothills, the current plan of action is well suited, but large and destructive fire may persist due to the climate change and the fuel accumulation. In mountainous areas with low fire activity, fire suppression forces will likely have to adapt to the forecasted increase of fire activity.",['sde']

Realistic uncertainties on Hapke model parameters from photometric measurements,"The single particle phase function describes the manner in which an average element of a granular material diffuses the light in the angular space usually with two parameters: the asymmetry parameter b describing the width of the scattering lobe and the backscattering fraction c describing the main direction of the scattering lobe. Hapke proposed a convenient and widely used analytical model to describe the spectro-photometry of granular materials. Using a compilation of the published data, Hapke (Hapke, B. [2012]. Icarus 221, 1079–1083) recently studied the relationship of b and c for natural examples and proposed the hockey stick relation (excluding b>0.5b>0.5 and c>0.5c>0.5). For the moment, there is no theoretical explanation for this relationship. One goal of this article is to study a possible bias due to the retrieval method. We expand here an innovative Bayesian inversion method in order to study into detail the uncertainties of retrieved parameters. On Emission Phase Function (EPF) data, we demonstrate that the uncertainties of the retrieved parameters follow the same hockey stick relation, suggesting that this relation is due to the fact that b and c are coupled parameters in the Hapke model instead of a natural phenomena. Nevertheless, the data used in the Hapke (Hapke, B. [2012]. Icarus 221, 1079–1083) compilation generally are full Bidirectional Reflectance Diffusion Function (BRDF) that are shown not to be subject to this artifact. Moreover, the Bayesian method is a good tool to test if the sampling geometry is sufficient to constrain the parameters (single scattering albedo, surface roughness, b,cb,c, opposition effect). We performed sensitivity tests by mimicking various surface scattering properties and various single image-like/disk resolved image, EPF-like and BRDF-like geometric sampling conditions. The second goal of this article is to estimate the favorable geometric conditions for an accurate estimation of photometric parameters in order to provide new constraints for future observation campaigns and instrumentations.",['phys']

ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF Momordica charantia AND Terminalia catappa ON MULTIDRUG RESISTANT INVASIVE Escherichia coli ISOLATED IN READY-TO-EAT FOODS FROM EKITI STATE,"Antibacterial activity of aqueous extract of Momordica charantia and Terminalia were investigated against multidrug resistant invasive Escherichia coli isolated from ready-to-eat foods such as sausage rolls, meat pie, egg roll, doughnut and smoked fish. From the samples tested, smoked fish was found to have the highest microbial load of 1.05x104cfu/ml (55%). Followed by Meat pie with 7.5x104cfu/ml (37%); Sausage roll with 7.0x104cfu/ml (36%); Egg roll with 6.5x104cfu/ml (40%). Doughnut was found to have the lowest microbial load of 58x104cfu/ml (20%). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract determined by agar dilution technique showed that M. charantia and T. catappa had an MIC of 0.5 g/mL and the degree of antibacterial potency of the extracts determined using broth dilution technique showed that at concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. M. charantia and T. catappa had diameter of zone of inhibition of 10.4mm and 11.2mm respectively. The observed antibacterial effect of the T. catappa was more pronounced. This investigation has opened up the possibility of the use of extract of T. catappa in drug development for the treatment of infections caused by E. coli isolated from ready-to-eat foods.",['sdv']
Submicrocristalline structure and dynamic recovery of cold flowformed ELI grade Ti-6Al-4V,"Flowforming is a means to produce seamless tubes by plastic deformation at room temperature. It consists in reducing the thickness of a tubular part mounted on a mandrel by deforming it using several rollers translating along the tube axis, while the tube is rotating along its axis. Thanks to the high compressive stresses, and to the incremental nature of the deformation process, flowforming can lead to a high thickness reduction and thus to high elongation of the deformed tubes. Ti-6Al-4V (Extra Low Interstitial grade) tubes have been deformed by cold flowforming, with a thickness reduction ratio higher than 60%, and their microstructures have been investigated using light optical microscopy (LOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). Based on EBSD data, a post-processing analysis has been performed in order to study the texture of the flowformed parts. Optical Microscopy showed that the material could be deformed without displaying flow instability such as adiabatic shear banding, despite the fact that it has been processed out of the stable processing maps (high strain rate and low temperature). It also evidenced a major deformation along the tube axis accompanied with a slight twist due to torsion stress. EBSD analysis indicated the occurrence of continuous dynamic recrystallization, which is rarely reported in the α-β domain of such alloys. The recovery/ recrystallization effects resulted in a submicrocrystalline equiaxed structure, which is consistent with that previously reported for Ti-6Al-4V subjected to severe plastic deformation (SPD). The texture of the hexagonal α-phase appeared to be similar to that obtained on extruded Ti-6Al-4V, with a basal component perpendicular to the tube axis",['spi']
On the Resilience of Wireless Multiuser Networks to Passive and Active Eavesdroppers,"Physical layer security can provide alternative means for securing the exchange of confidential messages in wireless applications. In this paper, the resilience of wireless multiuser networks to passive (interception of the broadcast channel) and active (interception of the broadcast channel and false feedback) eavesdroppers is investigated under Rayleigh fading conditions. Stochastic characterizations of the secrecy capacity (SC) are obtained in scenarios involving a base station and several destinations. The expected values and variances of the SC along with the probabilities of secrecy outages are evaluated in the following cases: (i) in the presence of passive eavesdroppers without any side information; (ii) in the presence of passive eavesdroppers with side information about the number of eavesdroppers; and (iii) in the presence of a single active eavesdropper with side information about the behavior of the eavesdropper. This investigation demonstrates that substantial secrecy rates are attainable on average in the presence of passive eavesdroppers as long as minimal side information is available. On the other hand, it is further found that active eavesdroppers can potentially compromise such networks unless statistical inference is employed to restrict their ability to attack. Interestingly, in the high signal to noise ratio regime, multiuser networks become insensitive to the activeness or passiveness of the attack.","['info', 'math']"
Simultaneous Influence of Static Load and Temperature on the Electromechanical Signature of Piezoelectric Elements Bonded to Composite Aeronautic Structures,"Electromechanical (EM) signature techniques have raised a huge interest in the structural health-monitoring community. These methods aim at assessing structural damages and sensors degradation by analyzing the EM responses of piezoelectric components bonded to aeronautic structures. These structures are subjected simultaneously to static loads and temperature variations that affect the metrics commonly used for damage detection and sensor diagnostics. However, the effects of load and temperature on these metrics have mostly been addressed separately. This paper presents experimentations conducted to investigate the simultaneous influence of static load and temperature on these metrics for two kinds of piezoelectric elements (lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and macrofiber composite (MFC)) bonded on sandwich composite materials, for the full range of real-life conditions encountered in aeronautics. Results obtained indicate that both factors affect the metrics in a coupled manner in particular due to the variations of the mechanical properties of the bonding layer when crossing its glass transition temperature. Furthermore, both piezoelectric elements globally behave similarly when subjected to temperature variations and static loads. Simultaneous accounting of both temperature and static load is thus needed in practice in order to design reliable structural health-monitoring systems based on these metrics.","['info', 'spi']"
Time-Frequency Features of 3-D Sound Propagation in Wedge-Shaped Oceanic Waveguides,"This paper considers propagation of low-frequency broadband pulses in shallow water. It focuses on across-slope propagation in wedge-shaped oceanic waveguides and on single hydrophone receiving configurations. In a low-frequency shallow-water context, propagation is dispersive and usually described by modal theory. However, in the presence of a tilted bottom, propagation is also affected by 3-D effects (horizontal refractions). The paper shows that time-frequency analysis is a suitable tool to illustrate and understand 3-D propagation. It illustrates the pertinence of the time-frequency analysis of 3-D signal by proposing an algorithm to estimate the seabed slope using a single receiver. The method is benchmarked on numerical simulations, and successfully applied on small-scale experimental data.",['spi']

Linearization and implementation of venu model in small strain theory for polyamide 6.6,"The so-called VENU model is a visco-hyperelastic constitutive model, designed for amorphous rubbery polymers, which is based on an original approach initially developed by N. Billon (J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 125:4390-4401, 2012) and extended by A. Maurel-Pantel et al. (Int. J. Plast. 67:102126, 2015) to three-dimensional thermomechanical framework. In the aforementioned references, the constitutive equations and thermodynamical framework are presented within large deformation theory. However, in fatigue tests of polymeric composites significant temperature gradients are noticed despite the fact that the measured strains are within the small strain theory. In addition, well established techniques and tools of micromechanics for polymeric composites are applicable in small deformation regions. These observations render important the reduction of the VENU model in the case of linear strains. Here, a method is proposed for the reduction of the VENU model to small strain theory. A proper numerical scheme is also provided, based on the so-called return-mapping algorithm. The model capabilities are illustrated by comparing numerical calculations with available experimental data for polyamide 66.",['spi']
Damage-tolerant active control using a modal H∞-norm-based methodology,"A new approach for vibration reduction of flexible structures subject to damage is here proposed, based on modal H∞H∞-norm control. Considering that structural damage provokes different effects on each vibration mode, the proposed method concentrates the control action on modes that are indeed suffering the worst damage consequences. For this purpose, a new modal H∞H∞ norm is introduced, weighing each mode according to control design convenience. Based on this norm, a regular H∞H∞ controller design is applied, using the linear matrix inequality approach. Simulated and experimental results show significant advantages of the proposed methodology over the regular H∞H∞ approach, including damage tolerance.",['spi']
FIR filter-based online jerk-constrained trajectory generation,"In the context of human-robot manipulation interaction for service or industrial robotics, the robot controller must be able to quickly react to unpredictable events in dynamic environments. In this paper, a FIR filter-based trajectory generation methodology is presented, combining the simplicity of the analytic second-order trajectory generation, i.e. acceleration-limited trajectory, with the flexibility and computational efficiency of FIR filtering, to generate on the fly smooth jerk-constrained trajectories. The proposed methodology can generate synchronized (fixed-time) and time-optimal jerk-limited trajectories from arbitrary initial velocity and acceleration conditions within 20 microsecond. Other jerk-constrained trajectories such as jerk-time fixed trajectories, which are particularly suitable for vibration reduction, can be easily generated. Experimental validations carried out on a seven axis Kuka LBR iiwa are presented.",['spi']
A spatiotemporal information management framework for product design and assembly process planning reconciliation,"This paper introduces an innovative framework for product design and assembly process planning reconciliation. Nowadays, both product lifecycle phases are quasi concurrently performed in industry and this configuration has led to competitive gains in efficiency and flexibility by improving designers’ awareness and product quality. Despite these efforts, some limitations/barriers are still encountered regarding the lack of dynamical representation, information consistency and information flow continuity. It is due to the inherent nature of the information created and managed in both phases and the lack of interoperability between the related information systems. Product design and assembly process planning phases actually generate heterogeneous information, since the first one describes all information related to ‘‘what to be delivered’’ and the latter rationalises all information with regards to ‘‘how to be assembled’’. In other words, the integration of assembly planning issue in product design requires reconciliation means with appropriate relationships of the architectural product definition in space with its assembly sequence in terms of time. Therefore, the main objective is to provide a spatiotemporal information management framework based on a strong semantic and logical foundation in product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, increasing therefore actors’ awareness, flexibility and efficiency with a better abstraction of the physical reality and appropriate information management procedures. A case study is presented to illustrate the relevance of the proposed framework and its hub-based implementation within PLM systems.",['spi']

Oxidative stress in farm animals: general aspects,"Sensorial and nutritional qualities of animal products could be highly deteriorated by bad practices during the pre-abattage period. Transport, handling or bad feeding strategy could alter the pro and anti-oxidant equilibrium of muscle, which could involve a higher susceptibility to lipids and proteins peroxidation. Peroxidation reactions are able to alter the animal products qualities (meat, milk, egg) and particularly the color and the tenderness of meat. Adapted feeding strategy and good preservation of antioxidant status of animals seems to be the best way to preserve the nutritional quality of animal products.Chez les animaux de rente, comme chez l’Homme, le stress oxydant est généré par des situations de stress d’origine physiologique, environnementale ou nutritionnelle. De nombreuses molécules biologiques (lipides, protéines, glucides, acides nucléiques) peuvent être « oxydées » par les espèces radicalaires générées lors d’un stress oxydant. L’organisme possède tout un arsenal de molécules antioxydantes d’origine endogène ou alimentaire. Il est possible d’évaluer la capacité antioxydante globale au niveau de l’animal lui-même ou de ses produits par l’emploi simultané de plusieurs méthodes complémentaires. Le stress oxydant peut avoir des conséquences sur la qualité des produits mais aussi sur la santé des animaux. Ainsi, il a été montré que de mauvaises conditions d’élevage comme la diminution des surfaces au sol ou la conduite sur caillebottis diminuaient la résistance des animaux au stress oxydant. De même, il existe de fortes corrélations entre différentes maladies métaboliques ou différentes pathologies de type infectieux ou inflammatoire et un déficit en antioxydants.",['sdv']
Protective effects of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) on fibroblast and melanoma cell lines in vitro: it’s implication for wound healing,"The aim of this study was to investigate the role of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) against various skin health parameters using in vitro human foreskin fibroblast and melanoma cell lines (i.e. HFF-1 and B16-F10). The study was assessed using cell viability by MTT assay, identification of extracellular matrix component in HFF-1 cell line (i.e. collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid), melanin synthesis in B16-F10 cells, cell viability against UVB-induced stress in HFF-1 cells, and in vitro wound healing by the scratch assay. THC was found to be safe and nontoxic up to the concentration of 10 µg/mL with improved level of collagen (37.90%), elastin (90.1%), and hyaluronic acid (74.19%) at 1 µg/mL. Besides, melanin was significantly inhibition by 78.5% at the lowest THC concentration of 0.1 µg/mL. UVB-protection rate was significantly improved by 61.2% and improved cell viability by THC in HFF-1 cells, which indicated protection from photoaging. In addition, THC showed significant wound healing activity (78.51%) and greater migration of fibroblast in HFF-1 cells at different time period. It can be concluded from the study that THC can protect the skin matrix with improved extracellular component synthesis and would healing via collagen synthesis in the skin, which improved the skin elasticity and tightness. Overall, it might be suggested that THC can be used as a safe skin whitening agent, wounds management, cosmetic applications, and treating various skin-related disorders.",['sdv']
How to implement organoleptic quality assessment in a participatory plant breeding approach,"Sensory quality is a great expectation from consumer and more specifically from the new organic consumer (post food crisis) which is more interested in the practical aspect than the environmental ones (Zanoli et al.). Whereas some objectives’ quality parameters can be measured by instrument (firmness, maturity, acidity…), sensory quality measurement need to analyse human perception. In the context of the European project SOLIBAM, a new methodology is experimented to integrate gustatory criterion in the breeding process, and particularly in participatory plant breeding programs. This methodology called “Napping®” involves a panel of professionals of the product (breeders, bakers, farmers), who have to position the product onto a large sheet of paper according to the sensory distance (similarity/dissimilarity) he perceives between the products. Ones the panellist had position its products; he had to associate one or two descriptors to each product. This poster aims to illustrate the methodology with an example on breads.","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"
Innovation for organic Broccoli: Breeding for diversity and quality in France,"In the framework of SOLIBAM, integrated breeding strategy are implemented in order to develop populations adapted to organic and low input practices (WP3, tasks 3.1, 3.2 and WP6, task 6.3). As sensory quality is a great expectation from organic consumer, breeding strategy will integrate sensory criteria. In order to create new type populations, a large germplasm of broccoli have been first screened for their agronomical performance and their sensory quality. On these results, a minimum number of common traits required have been proposed on the agronomical, gustatory qualities and more secondary on appearance traits. The next step consists in selecting individuals of interest, crossing them in order to tend to populations which complied with requirement. Each harvest will lead to a sensory evaluation and help the breeding choice.","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"
Breeding for Low Input and Organic systems : stakeholders expectations – French inputs on vegetables,"Adapted varieties are missing for the organic sector. In the framework of an European research programme, the SOLIBAM project (Strategies for Organic and Low Input (LI) Breeding and Management), a survey was undertaken to determine i) the important traits (specific to Organic and LI farming) for cereals including wheat, and horticultural crops including tomatoes, ii) organic stakeholders’ expectations in plant breeding over a wide range of different agro-climatic conditions in Europe and Africa: Ethiopia, France, Germany, Italy, Mali and Portugal. This study aims to provide data where the existing published information remains very low: identification of the varieties currently grown by the organic / LI producers; reasons of their variety choice; producers’ expectations for organic dedicated varieties. Two main market categories have been clearly identified from stakeholders’ answers. These categories and results fit with the hypothesis that the market is a significant factor influencing the choice of seeds and varieties. Expectations and practices of producers selling on a local market (direct sale) differ radically from those of producers selling on the whole market.","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"

Refutation in Research: How to Improve Publication quality,"I examine how incentives for refutation affect publication quality. I build a sequential model of public experimentation with two scientists, a researcher and a refuter. The researcher chooses when to publish a result confirming a hypothesis, with a probability that the result has type I error. The publication quality corresponds to the probability that the hypothesis is valid, which is the complement of the probability of type I error. Once the result is published, the refuter starts experimenting but, unlike the researcher, he can choose between working on refutation or on an outside safe option at any time. When scientists are initially pessimistic about the hypothesis' confirmation and when refutation is costly for the researcher, the higher the refutation rewards, the lower the equilibrium publication quality in case the researcher is more efficient than the refuter. The opposite result holds when the refuter is more efficient. In an extension, when the researcher's experimentation is private, I prove that the publication quality is lower than in the public experimentation case, suggesting that transparency improves research quality",['shs']
"Being a Tourist as a Chosen Experience in a Proximity DestinationÊtre touriste, une expérience choisie dans une destination de proximité","Being a tourist isn't a passive attitude. It is the result of a conscious decision essentially based onhow individuals build what they perceive as unknown and how they decide to get to know it. In other words, tourists deliberately create a distance with the destination which allows them to enjoy the tourist experience as something exceptional. This paper is part of an ongoing research and focuses on the subjective construction of the otherness, since this process determines what is left to be discovered. First, a theoretical overview will introduce the concepts of usual environment, proximity and tourist.Then, we will focus on guided tours as a mechanism of mediation between individuals and places. Finally, we will move on to the case of Barcelona's walking tours and the local participants' experience as a way to adopt a tourist's approach. Preliminary results show, first, four categories of experience of proximate guided tours: educational, expert, recreational and tourist. Then, they focus on the proximity tourist experience usingUrry and Larsen's notion of the "" tourist gaze "" and Tuan's theory on the tourist and the resident's points of view. According to these theories,participants'motivations andtheir individual frame of reference define a tourist's point of view. Based on that,results show that proximity tourists and traditional tourists share curiosity as motivation but don't have the same points of reference.In spite of that, the feeling of proximity with the destination doesn't constitute a barrier to become a tourist. It is the conscious adoption of the tourist's role which makes the individual gaze upon the visited areas like a tourist, regardless of the proximity with the environment. This approach of proximity tourism constitutes a way to enhance familiarplaces anddevelop tourism in an environmentally concerned context where proximate destinations are being promoted.Être touriste n'est pas une attitude passive. C'est le résultat d'une décision consciente basée essentiellement sur la manière dont les individus construisent ce qu'ils perçoivent comme inconnu et comment ils décident de le découvrir. En d'autres termes, les touristes créent expressément une distance avec la destination leur permettant de vivre l'expérience touristique comme exceptionnelle. Cet article fait partie d'une recherche en cours et se penche sur la construction subjective de l'altérité, car ce processus détermine ce qui peut être découvert. D'abord, la partie théorique présentera les notions de l'environnement habituel, la proximité et le touriste. Ensuite, nous nous pencherons sur les visites guidées en tant que mécanismes de médiation entre les individus et les lieux. Les résultats préliminaires montrent, d'abord, quatre catégories de l'expérience des visites guidées de proximité : pédagogique, expert, récréatif et touristique. Puis, ces résultats se centrent sur l'expérience touristique de proximité, utilisant les notions du regard touristique d'Urry et Larsen et la théorie de Tuan sur les points de vue du touriste et de l'habitant. Selon ces théories, les motivations des participants et leur cadre individuel de référence définissent le point de vue du touriste. En base à cela, les résultats montrent que les touristes de proximité et les touristes traditionnels partagent la curiosité comme motivation mais n'ont pas les mêmes points de référence. Malgré cela, le sentiment de proximité envers la destination ne constitue pas une barrière pour devenir touriste. C'est l'adoption consciente du rôle du touriste qui rend touristique le regard individuel sur les lieux visités, en dépit de la proximité avec ces lieux. L'approche du tourisme de proximité renforce les lieux de l'ordinaire et développe le tourisme dans un contexte de conscientisation environnementale où les destinations de proximité deviennent de plus en plus importantes.",['shs']

Choquet integral is employed to aggregate the criteria evaluations of alternatives to reflect the interactions of the criteria. Objective and subjective information are integrated to derive the interactions of the criteria. The objective information of alternatives is expressed by decision matrix, whereas the subjective information is expressed by utilities or interval preference relations. Models are given to minimize the objective and subjective information. The proposed method can be considered as an extension of the existing methods, and can obtain smaller deviations and better overall evaluations of alternatives.",['info']
Group testing against Covid-19,"It is well-known that group testing is an efficient strategy to screen for the presence of a virus. It consists of pooling n individual samples with a single test using RT-PCR. If no individual in the group is infected, the group test is negative. Thus, a single test may reveal this crucial information. We show how group testing can be optimised in three applications to multiply the power of tests against Covid-19: Estimating virus prevalence to measure the evolution of the pandemic, bringing negative groups back to work to exit the current lockdown, and testing for individual infectious status to treat sick people. For an infection level around 2%, group testing could multiply the power of testing by a factor of 20. The implementation of this strategy in the short run requires limited investments and could bypass the current immense shortage of testing capacity.",['shs']
Rhesus macaques use probabilities to predict future events,"Humans can use an intuitive sense of statistics to make predictions about uncertain future events, a cognitive skill that underpins logical and mathematical reasoning. Recent research shows that some of these abilities for statistical inferences can emerge in preverbal infants and non-human primates such as apes and capuchins. An important question is therefore whether animals share the full complement of intuitive reasoning abilities demonstrated by humans, as well as what evolutionary contexts promote the emergence of such skills. Here, we examined whether free-ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) can use probability information to infer the most likely outcome of a random lottery, in the first test of whether primates can make such inferences in the absence of direct prior experience. We developed a novel expectancy-violation looking time task, adapted from prior studies of infants, in order to assess the monkeys' expectations. In Study 1, we confirmed that monkeys (n = 20) looked similarly at different sampled items if they had no prior knowledge about the population they were drawn from. In Study 2, monkeys (n = 80) saw a dynamic ‘lottery’ machine containing a mix of two types of fruit outcomes, and then saw either the more common fruit (expected trial) or the relatively rare fruit (unexpected trial) fall from the machine. We found that monkeys looked longer when they witnessed the unexpected outcome. In Study 3, we confirmed that this effect depended on the causal relationship between the sample and the population, not visual mismatch: monkeys (n = 80) looked equally at both outcomes if the experimenter pulled the sampled item from her pocket. These results reveal that rhesus monkeys spontaneously use information about probability to reason about likely outcomes, and show how comparative studies of nonhumans can disentangle the evolutionary history of logical reasoning capacities.",['shs']
PPHD: a platform for high-speed phenotypingPPHD: une plateforme pour le phenotypage a haut debit,"The methodologies for genotyping and high throughput automated platforms for the production of type-omics (genomics, transcriptomics, protected omics ...) have greatly increased over the last few years and are now available to analyze the expression of genes of plants in several environmental conditions.

This systematic exploration of diversity. Genetics within a species or between species requires platforms to characterize and automatically varied environments (biotic and abiotic) the phenotype of a large number of individuals from populations of mutants mapping, crosses and collections. The challenge is to achieve the flow rates in the production data from phenotyping, genotyping similar ones. The quantitative characters being observed - the components of the air architecture such as the number, size, shape and position of the leaves, for example - they require extremely precise control of changes in environmental parameters. Phenotyping Broadband is essential for genetic analysis of functional genes as specific particular reduces the time required for the discovery of new genes likely to generate important agronomic applications, such as changing the content of molecules, the composition and size of seeds and fruits, or tolerance to drought","['sdv', 'sde']"

Is ‘more’ enough: Reassessing the impact of growth on inequality and poverty,"The relationship between economic growth and human development is complex, and even the relatively simple links between economic growth and people not having sufficient money for basic essentials such as food and medicines (known as income poverty) are not well understood. Increasingly urgent environmental considerations militate against the pursuit of unconstrained growth, while at the same time making more pressing the need to ensure that growth delivers reductions in income poverty. The impact on poverty partly hinges on whether or not economic growth is likely to reduce or exacerbate income inequality, making it a more or a less powerful instrument against poverty. It has been suggested that if growth generally reduces or does not affect inequality, then policymakers can simply pursue growth as a development strategy – in other words, pursuing ‘more’ could be enough. Advances in econometric technique have brought new results and new interpretations for policymakers, but this critical review suggests that there are no clear results that can be relied upon. Instead, our own analysis leads us to conclude that there is much variation in the relationship between income and inequality – inequality may either fall or rise as a result of growth. Moreover, we find that other aspects of development, such as health and education, may be more important than levels of income in determining the effect of growth on inequality and should therefore be given more attention by policymakers. At a minimum, these findings imply that policy recommendations concerning growth need to be based on careful analysis of country-specific development indicators. Seeking to maximise growth is unlikely to be appropriate development policy unless fairly specific conditions and policies are in place – and there is much more to understand about how these factors will change the impact of growth on inequality. Future research should aim to identify the preconditions and complementary policies necessary for growth to be of more benefit in reducing income poverty.",['sdv']

"Empirical methodology for the evaluation of collusive behaviour in vertically-related markets: an application to the ""yogurt cartel"" in France","The paper proposes a five-step methodology based on the estimation of demand and supply models to test the existence of manufacturers’ collusive behaviour and evaluate its impact on market and welfare. This methodology allows for the estimation of profit sharing in vertical chains by properly modelling the contracting stage between manufacturers and retailers. We apply this methodology to analyse the effects of the ""yogurt cartel"" that prevailed in the French dairy dessert market between private label providers during the period 2006-2012. We find that data supports collusive behaviour between private label manufacturers, and lead to average price increase varying from 7.3% and 11.3%, according to the product category. We found an umbrella effect on dairy products sold under national brands at the wholesale level but not at the retail level. The cartel benefits manufacturers both for the sales of the national brand and private label products, while retailers lost profits over the private label products but gained profits over the national brand products. The cartel implies a relatively low decrease in consumer welfare —lower than the gain for the industry—such that the overall welfare effect of the cartel is positive.",['shs']

The InterFrost benchmark of Thermo-Hydraulic codes for cold regions hydrology - first inter-comparison results,"The impacts of climate change in boreal regions has received considerable attention recently due to the warming trends that have been experienced in recent decades and are expected to intensify in the future. Large portions of these regions, corresponding to permafrost areas, are covered by water bodies (lakes, rivers) that interact with the surrounding permafrost. For example, the thermal state of the surrounding soil influences the energy and water budget of the surface water bodies. Also, these water bodies generate taliks (unfrozen zones below) that disturb the thermal regimes of permafrost and may play a key role in the context of climate change. Recent field studies and modeling exercises indicate that a fully coupled 2D or 3D Thermo-Hydraulic (TH) approach is required to understand and model the past and future evolution of landscapes, rivers, lakes and associated groundwater systems in a changing climate. However, there is presently a paucity of 3D numerical studies of permafrost thaw and associated hydrological changes, and the lack of study can be partly attributed to the difficulty in verifying multi-dimensional results produced by numerical models. Numerical approaches can only be validated against analytical solutions for a purely thermic 1D equation with phase change (e.g. Neumann, Lunardini). When it comes to the coupled TH system (coupling two highly non-linear equations), the only possible approach is to compare the results from different codes to provided test cases and/or to have controlled experiments for validation. Such inter-code comparisons can propel discussions to try to improve code performances. A benchmark exercise was initialized in 2014 with a kick-off meeting in Paris in November. Participants from USA, Canada, Germany, Sweden and France convened, representing altogether 13 simulation codes. The benchmark exercises consist of several test cases inspired by existing literature (e.g. McKenzie et al., 2007) as well as new ones. They range from simpler, purely thermal cases (benchmark T1) to more complex, coupled 2D TH cases (benchmarks TH1, TH2, and TH3). Some experimental cases conducted in cold room complement the validation approach. A web site hosted by LSCE (Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement) is an interaction platform for the participants and hosts the test cases database at the following address: https://wiki.lsce.ipsl.fr/interfrost. The results of the first stage of the benchmark exercise will be presented. We will mainly focus on the inter-comparison of participant results for the coupled cases (TH1, TH2 & TH3). Further perspectives of the exercise will also be presented. Extensions to more complex physical conditions (e.g. unsaturated conditions and geometrical deformations) are contemplated. In addition, 1D vertical cases of interest to the Climate Modeling community will be proposed.

Interview de Peggy Levitt pour Migration Systems (Interview Explainer),"A discussion with Peggy Levitt about the importance of decompartmentalizing Migration Studies and of engaging in inter-disciplinary conversations to better understand human mobility and diversifying societies. The ways we are in the world have changed. The world is highly global and interdependent. Many people are internal or international migrants who embrace multiple affinities and memberships. Peggy Levitt argues that migration theory needs to move away from its emphasis on integration, inclusion and the nation-state to a more transnational, interdisciplinary approach that is better suited to capture current dynamics.",['shs']

Damage and permeability of composite laminates,"This study focuses on the link between damage development and permeability evolution of composite laminates. By making use of an original device, measurement of the permeability of composite pipes under pressure and quantification of leak paths were conducted. Presented results show that very few (about one per 100 cm2) leak paths are sufficient to increase the permeability of several orders of magnitude, suggesting the existence of a preliminary phase characterized by a progressive development of a few cracks. Damage modelling and identification are proposed, allowing this phase to be taken into account. From this modelling coupled with a simplified representation of the crack network, prediction of leak path density is provided.",['spi']
A new device for measurement of permeability evolution under pressure loading: application to CFRP pipes,"This paper presents an experimental setup for the measurement of permeability evolution induced by mechanical loading. The experiment consists in ressurizing a pipe-specimen. Internal pressure is used for both loading and permeability measurement. The external face of the pipe is accessible, so that leak paths can be localized and quantified. In order to avoid premature cracking of the specimen due to the device, sealing components were designed using Finite Element Analysis with respect to the stiffness of pipes to be tested. Although current design enables various carbon composite pipes to be tested, it can be easily adapted to other materials. A validation of the design was achieved by measuring permeability on an impermeable pipe. The experimental setup and method were applied to a composite filament wound pipe. Results give substantial quantitative information on the relationship between the number of leak paths and the increase in material permeability.",['spi']
A model for the prediction of transverse crack and delamination density based on a strength and fracture mechanics probabilistic approach,"The aim of this study is to provide a relevant description of damage growth and the resultant network for leakage prediction in liner-less composite vessels. A damage meso-model built on strength and energy criteria as proposed in FFM (Finite Fracture Mechanics) is introduced. Both criteria have to be fulfilled for the creation of the first transverse crack of the RVE (Representative Volume Element). The increase of crack density and the propagation of micro-delamination at crack tips are managed by Fracture Mechanics using the energy release rate. In this way the effect of ply thickness is explicitly accounted. The energy release rate at the meso-scale (RVE scale) is calculated from a multiscale approach. Numerical results show that, in [0 2 /90 1 /0 2 ] and [0 2 /90 3 /0 2 ] lay-ups under tensile stress, no delamination should occur for values of the energy release rates from the literature. This conclusion is reinforced by cross-section examinations through the width of specimens submitted to tensile loading. Delamination almost disappears after removing a few microns of the surface. Experimental results also highlight a preliminary step in the damage scenario with small cracking rate, likely driven by weak areas (defects locations). The modelling of this step being fundamental for the prediction of first leak paths, it was introduced througha probabilistic approach.",['spi']
DEVELOPMENT OF STRUCTURING MODEL OF WOUND COMPOSITE VESSEL DOME,"Nowadays, the composite pressure vessels are the most mature mode for storing hydrogen at very high pressure. Regardless of the many advantages of the composite pressure vessels, storage under high pressure leads to the use of thick layers of composite, and the behaviour of this type of structure is poorly mastered due to the higher impact of the process on the material-structure behaviour, and especially at the dome area. In order to model the behaviour of composite pressure vessels, in this paper a structuring model of composite pressure vessels is proposed. The structuring model takes into account the variability and specificity of the geometry of the dome area that is considered as the most problematic part of the composite pressure vessels. We integrate in our sizing model properties such as end of helical layers, thickness evolution, winding angle evolution, voids and fibre content.",['spi']
Relationship between damage and permeability in liner-less composite tanks : experimental study at the lamina level,"The aim of this study is to provide a relevant description of damage growth and the resultant crack network to predict leaks in liner-less composite vessels. Tensile tests were carried out on three different laminates: [02/90n/02], [+45/-45]2s and [0/+67.5/-67.5]s. Number n varies from 1 to 3 in order to study the effect of ply thickness. Transverse crack and delamination at crack tips were identified with an optical microscope during tensile loading. A length of 100 mm was observed for several loading levels to evaluate statistical effects. Results highlight a preliminary step in the damage scenario with small crack densities before a second step where the crack growth speeds up. In bulk, cross-section examinations showed that no delamination occurred at crack tip in the material of the study (M21 T700). Cross-section examinations were also performed on [+45/-45]2s and [0/+67.5/-67.5]s layups in order to bypass the issue of free edge effects. Damage state in those layups was shown to be significantly different in the bulk than at the surface. Observations of the damage state in bulk for those layups demonstrated that there is no transverse crack in [+45/-45]2s specimens subjected to shear strains up to 4%, and that interactions between damage of consecutive plies strongly impact both the damage kinetics and the arrangement of cracks. These elements are fundamental for the assessment of permeability performance, and will be introduced in the predictive model.",['spi']
Agroecological engineering of crop and livestock health. Case studies in the French West Indies,"Current crop and livestock farming strategies based on elite varieties and breeds and intensive use of chemicals (pesticides, medicines) suffer from major limitations. Production losses, alteration of natural resources, loss of biodiversity, risk to human health, and vulnerability of the agrosystems dependent on polluted resources are part of the numerous undesirable side effects. The solutions derived from the paradigm of eradication of pathogens have shown their limits. The considerable variability and adaptability among pathogen strains results in emerging resistance and replacement of susceptible with resistant strains in many pathogen species. When extremely aggressive emergent pests or resistance breakage occur, no more food production is possible. Novel approaches and methods are needed to encourage diseases management. The development of an ecological engineering approach that combines nested multi-scale levers is necessary. Mobilizing ecological interactions, largely unexplored, is a key issue to design new health management options. Thus, it fits in with the “smart” (FAO 2011) approach required for the agroecological transition. We analyze how to enhance ecological interactions for crop and animal health. Based on a conceptual grid (Chave, 2015; Chave and Angeon, 2014), we show that consistent strategies for mobilizing ecological interactions rely on a complex activation of key levers at different spatial scales. We apply this analytical grid to two case studies relating to plant and animal health in the French West Indies. These areas face strong challenging diseases for which most of the conventional solutions requiring the use of chemicals barely function. By applying an analytical grid that constitutes the ABCs of ecological regulation to crop and livestock health, we point out strategic choices lead in the French West Indies to cope with diseases. We show how new multi-scale approaches are implemented to identify solutions to enhance ecological interactions for crop and livestock health.",['sdv']
Agroecological transition and territorial governance: The strength of words - Some insights from a Guadeloupian perspective,"Acknowledging the contribution of agriculture to global changes and its negative impacts on the environment, it is now seen as unavoidable for it to participate to the ecological transition. This research aims to understand the performativity of legal texts. This performativity does not only reveal the institutions’ approach of the model to implement. It also aims to change, in the meantime, the reality (Ambroise et al., 2015). The objective of this research is to stress the importance of concepts' definitions in policies implementation when agricultural system reframing is at stake, and to highlight an uncertain use of words may produce. However, little attention is given to the choice of terms concerning the definition of a greener agriculture in official texts: terms are often mixed up without any clarification. Applying content analysis to official documents, we provide an analytical grid to grasp in what extent the unclear use of words and what they namely designate, lead to ambiguous policies eluding aspects of the concept of agroecology underlined by researchers or associations. We also shed light on the local appropriation process of the concept and its specification in the French Indies.",['sdv']

Exploring conditions for agricultural viability in Guadeloupe: Identifying gatekeepers. Some insights from the French Caribbean,"Toward exacerbated global changes, one of the main current challenges is to implement agrecological transition. In this context, territorial scale appears as a consistent level where governance procedures are experienced. The context is the one of a multi-level and multi-actors’ governance leading to change in local public policy. We questioned 21 key stakeholders from agricultural frameworks as well as actors from collective organisations. By combining textual analysis tools and graph theory, we focus on stakeholders’ representations of viability as these actors produce advice regarding the settings of administrative and regulatory planning. We identify four key dimensions to viability (economical, agroecological, socio-cultural and organisational). The results show a continuum on the agroecological dimension of viability. They reveal the pivotal role of gatekeepers designed as actors able to support substantive change by transforming the agroecological dimension of viability in a ‘rational myth’. By doing so, they could initiate collective actions to promote change and support agroecological transition.",['sdv']

Eifel-Rur: Old Water Rights and Fixed Frameworks for Action,"This chapter summarises our analysis of drought governance in the Eifel-Rur region of Germany. Within the Interreg IV-B project DROP a team of researchers from five universities and knowledge institutes performed two field visits to the Eifel-Rur region and held interviews with authorities and stakeholders. The visits were facili-tated by the DROP project partner Eifel-Rur Waterboard (Wasserverband Eifel-Rur, WVER). Interviews were both individual and in group settings; in the second visit interim results were presented to stakeholders in a workshop. Stakeholders inter-viewed included representatives from drinking water producers, nature protection authorities, industrial water users, farmer representatives, electricity generating companies, environmental NGOs,fishermen, sailing schools, and local (municipal) and regional (district) authorities in charge of water management. The analysis was guided by a drought-specific Governance Assessment Tool (GAT), which uses five governance dimensions (levels and scales, actors and networks, problem perceptions and goal ambitions, strategies and instruments, responsibilities and resources) and four governance criteria (extent, coherence, flexibility and intensity) in its analysis. In the following, we present the context of water management in the Eifel-Rur region, describe some drought actions which have already been implemented, explain the results of our analysis in terms of the Governance Assessment Toolkit and present our recommendations for improved drought governance in the region. An aspect of the Eifel-Rur water management system which is central for its drought governance is the water rights' system in place. The region's water rights&amp;#8212;some of them centuries old&amp;#8212;provide their owners with very strong legal claims to the resource; furthermore, the current system of rights and charges does not provide real incentives for users to reduce their water rights/water use. These features make the demand side of the water system very inflexible. In addition, the region's significant number of reservoirs allows for a very stable supply of water over time,which means that users are not prone to include risks related to water supply into their risk strategies. This lack of flexibility poses significant challenges for drought management, some of which are taken up in the final section ""Conclusions and case-specific recommendations"".","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"
Cross-cutting Perspective Freshwater,"One singularity of northwestern Europe (NWE) is that severe droughts are rare events in the region and water scarcity has hardly been experienced in its history. The DROP pilot sites are not exceptions to this context. Although the lack of a drought history in wet areas can explain why drought and water scarcity are not necessarily the focus of (if ever considered in) river basin management plans, it must be noted that freshwater availability for drinking water provision remains a priority stake in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Providing a reliable and safe supply of drinking water may thus be a leading entryway to the development of drought risk awareness and drought adaptation measures in a river basin. When such essential resource is threatened and the competition for water among users increases, there is a good chance that reflections and changes will be triggered. Water use conflicts and drinking water supply threats may arise due to increased water demand, but also due to decreased water availability. The later may occur because of natural climate variability, i.e., drier years than average, or as the result of the impact of climate change on local water resources. Climate change awareness is then an important asset to manage water availability. Where climate change awareness is low and adaptation measures are basically inexistent, social and political responses to drought adaptation may be slow and inefficient. However, even in those cases where climate change awareness is still low in general society, water authorities and other stakeholders are conscious that water demand tends to intensify with population and economic growth, rendering water scarcity conceivable and even foreseeable. Freshwater availability for drinking water supply is therefore an issue that can motivate the introduction of drought and water scarcity risks into the political and public agenda , even in &amp;#8220; drought-scarce &amp;#8221; regions. This chapter highlights the links between drought governance and the vulnerability of freshwater for drinking water supply, with a focus on drought adaptation. The main issues presented here are illustrated with how freshwater issues are managed in the DROP project cases with a particular focus on the two &amp;#8220; freshwater reservoir &amp;#8221; pilot sites: the Arzal dam in Brittany France (see Chap. 6 ) and the Eifel-Rur in Germany (see Chap. 4 ). Those two cases deal with reservoir management not only for drinking water supply (Fig. 11.1 ) but also for other uses, with various priority sets.",['sde']

Pyroclimatic classification of Mediterranean and mountain landscapes of southeastern FranceCaractérisation pyroclimatique des régions montagneuses du sud-est de la France,"Fire risk is expected to increase in the Mediterranean Basin like in many areas worldwide. Climate is likely the main driver of fire activity by conditioning fuel dryness and fire weather. However fire-climate relationships are conditioned by other environmental dimensions like fuel structure (composition and spatial arrangement of flammable vegetation) and human activities. Therefore assessing how climate controls fire activity in heavily anthropized landscapes like European Mediterranean regions requires to design analyses in appropriate geographic units to encompass the dominant fire drivers. We aimed to assess how spatiotemporal patterns of both fire activity and climate structured south-eastern France into homogeneous geographic unit which we defined as ‘pyroclimatic' regions. We performed a pyroclimatic classification of Mediterranean and mountain areas of south-eastern France at 2 km resolution from the national fire database and daily atmospheric parameters over 1973-2009. This classification was based on multidimensional and clustering analyses. South-eastern France is characterized by three main ‘pyroclimatic' regions and ten sub-regions from high fire-prone maritime mountains to moderate fire-prone hot lowlands and low fire-prone inner moist mountains. These geographic units are discriminated from each other by fire activity, fire seasonality, fire weather and their recent evolution. We demonstrated that fire activity and fire weather of south-eastern France are highly dynamic in space and time. Characterizing pyroclimatic regions offers new regional perspectives of fire management and policy because two areas having similar fire weather, fire regime and recent temporal trends would benefit for specific attention.",['sde']
European software tools for mapping Wildland Urban Interfaces in the Mediterranean contextUn logiciel européen pour la cartographie des interfaces habitat-forêt dans le contexte méditerranéen,"This paper aims to present a software tool allowing to map Wildland-urban interfaces (WUI) on local and global scales.

Study of compaction and sintering of nanosized oxide powders by in situ electrical measurements and dilatometry: Nano CeO2—case study,"Densification and sintering of CeO2 nanoparticles and their electrical properties were simultaneously studied as a function of temperature in controlled atmosphere using a modified dilatometer. CeO2 nanoparticles simultaneously shrink and become more resistive upon initial heating, associated with desorption of water. The electrical conductance G at 300-550 A degrees C revealed a pO(2) dependence described by log (G) = A + n x log (pO(2)) with n similar to -1/6, consistent with n-type conduction. The results were analyzed with a defect equilibrium model based on the reduction of ceria and formation of doubly ionized oxygen vacancies and electrons. The activation energy was found equal to (1.3 A +/- 0.1) eV, which results in an enthalpy of reduction of (2.7 A +/- 0.4) eV, considerably lower than that for bulk ceria (similar to 4.5 eV). The coarsening of particles during heat treatment at 800 A degrees C were analysed assuming grain boundary diffusion-limited sintering. Although the coarsened powder shows a similar pO(2) dependence, the activation energy was considerably higher (1.9 A +/- 0.1) eV, leading to a reduction enthalpy of (4.5 A +/- 0.4) eV. The decrease in the enthalpy of reduction with decreasing particle size is consistent with the increasing fraction of oxide ions residing at the surface. Alternate interpretations based on space charge effects and surface adsorption/desorption were considered and found to be less consistent with the experimental results.",['chim']

Lower bounds for the Event Scheduling Problem with Consumption and Production of Resources,"The Event Scheduling Problem with Consumption and Production of Resources (ESPCPR) is a general scheduling problem where the availability of a resource is depleted and replenished at the occurrence times of a set of events. This problem is an extension of the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) where activities are replaced by events, which have to be scheduled subject to generalized precedence relations. The aim of this paper is to show the connections between ESPCPR and classical scheduling problems in order to bring new lower bounds for ESPCPR. We start by recalling some similar models in literature such as the Project Scheduling with Inventory Constraints and the Financing Problem. Subsequently, we describe how to model classical scheduling problems using ESPCPR. Finally, we propose four lower bounds for this problem. The obtained computational results confirm their effectiveness.",['info']
Low- and high-order accurate boundary conditions: From Stokes to Darcy porous flow modeled with standard and improved Brinkman lattice Boltzmann schemes,"The present contribution focuses on the accuracy of reflection-type boundary conditions in the Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy modeling of porous flows solved with the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which we operate with the two-relaxation-time (TRT) collision and the Brinkman-force based scheme (BF), called BF-TRT scheme. In parallel, we compare it with the Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy linear finite element method (FEM) where the Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced on grid vertices. In bulk, both BF-TRT and FEM share the same defect: in their discretization a correction to the modeled Brinkman equation appears, given by the discrete Laplacian of the velocity-proportional resistance force. This correction modifies the effective Brinkman viscosity, playing a crucial role in the triggering of spurious oscillations in the bulk solution. While the exact form of this defect is available in lattice-aligned, straight or diagonal, flows; in arbitrary flow/lattice orientations its approximation is constructed. At boundaries, we verify that such a Brinkman viscosity correction has an even more harmful impact. Already at the first order, it shifts the location of the no-slip wall condition supported by traditional LBM boundary schemes, such as the bounce-back rule. For that reason, this work develops a new class of boundary schemes to prescribe the Dirichlet velocity condition at an arbitrary wall/boundary-node distance and that supports a higher order accuracy in the accommodation of the TRT-Brinkman solutions. For their modeling, we consider the standard BF scheme and its improved version, called IBF; this latter is generalized in this work to suppress or to reduce the viscosity correction in arbitrarily oriented flows. Our framework extends the one- and two-point families of linear and parabolic link-wise boundary schemes, respectively called B-LI and B-MLI, which avoid the interference of the Brinkman viscosity correction in their closure relations. The performance of LBM and FEM is thoroughly evaluated in three benchmark tests, which are run throughout three distinctive permeability regimes. The first configuration is a horizontal porous channel, studied with a symbolic approach, where we construct the exact solutions of FEM and BF/IBF with different boundary schemes. The second problem refers to an inclined porous channel flow, which brings in as new challenge the formation of spurious boundary layers in LBM; that is, numerical artefacts that arise due to a deficient accommodation of the bulk solution by the low-accurate boundary scheme. The third problem considers a porous flow past a periodic square array of solid cylinders, which intensifies the previous two tests with the simulation of a more complex flow pattern. The ensemble of numerical tests provides guidelines on the effect of grid resolution and the TRT free collision parameter over the accuracy and the quality of the velocity field, spanning from Stokes to Darcy permeability regimes. It is shown that, with the use of the high-order accurate boundary schemes, the simple, uniform-mesh-based TRT-LBM formulation can even surpass the accuracy of FEM employing hardworking body-fitted meshes.",['sde']
Hardening/softening behavior and reduced order modeling of nonlinear vibrations of rotating cantilever beams,"This work addresses the large amplitude nonlinear vibratory behavior of a rotating cantilever beam, with applications to turbomachinery and turbopropeller blades. The aim of this work is twofold. Firstly, we investigate the effect of rotation speed on the beam nonlinear vibrations and especially on the hardening/softening behavior of its resonances and the appearance of jump phenomena at large amplitude. Secondly, we compare three models to simulate the vibrations. The first two are based on analytical models of the beam, one of them being original. Those two models are discretized on appropriate mode basis and solve by a numerical following path method. The last one is based on a finite-element discretization and integrated in time. The accuracy and the validity range of each model are exhibited and analyzed.",['spi']

Variations in the bathymetry and bottom morphology of the Izu-Bonin Trench modelled by GMT,"Cartographic visualisation is a central concept in geoinformatics, and Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) functionality provides a variety of modules for effective mapping. However, due to its specific scripting approach, there is not enough reported experience of GMT mapping, comparing to traditional GIS. This contribution introduces steps that can be taken to perform cartographic mapping and modelling using GMT. Geographically, this paper investigates the Izu-Bonin Trench in the Pacific Ocean. The aim was to compare its geomorphology in two segments, and each was modelled by a series of profiles. The comparative analysis shows that the southern segment is deeper and is a more precisely V-shaped form with a steeper gradient slope. The northern part has an asymmetric slope with submarine terraces to the west and a straight shape to the east. The northern profile is based on 407 samples (13.5%) at depths of -5,600 to -5,800 m, followed by 304 samples at -5,800 to -6,000 m (10%). The southern histogram has a bimodal distribution with two peaks: 523 samples (20%) with depths of -5,800 to -6,000 m. The second peak (10%) is on the Bonin Ridge. The GMT proved to be an effective instrument for marine geological mapping, 3D and 2D modelling, statistical analysis and graphical plotting.","['info', 'phys']"
Self-assembled liquid crystalline nanoparticles as an ophthalmic drug delivery system. Part I: influence of process parameters on their preparation studied by experimental design,"To develop self-assembled liquid crystalline nanoparticles as a drug delivery system for keratoconus treatment, a formulation containing riboflavin a water-soluble drug, two surfactants (poloxamer 407 and mono acyl glycerol -monoolein-) and water was optimized and prepared by emulsification and a homogenization process. A fractional factorial design was applied to estimate the main effects and interaction effects of five parameters on two responses, namely particle size and encapsulation efficiency. The five parameters are the temperature of the two phases, the duration of emulsification, the presence of heating during homogenization, the number of passes and pressure. The most influent parameters are the presence of heating during the homogenization and the pressure that led to the production of nanoparticles with an average size of 145 nm and an average encapsulation efficiency of 46%.",['chim']
Self-assembled liquid crystalline nanoparticles as an ophthalmic drug delivery system. Part II: optimization of formulation variables using experimental design,"In the field of keratoconus treatment, a lipid-based liquid crystal nanoparticles system has been developed to improve the preocular retention and ocular bioavailability of riboflavin, a water-soluble drug. The formulation of this ophthalmic drug delivery system was optimized by a simplex lattice experimental design. The delivery system is composed of three main components that are mono acyl glycerol (monoolein), poloxamer 407 and water and two secondary components that are riboflavin and glycerol (added to adjust the osmotic pressure). The amounts of these three main components were selected as the factors to systematically optimize the dependent variables that are the encapsulation efficiency and the particle size. In this way, 12 formulas describing experimental domain of interest were prepared. Results obtained using small angle X-rays scattering (SAXS) and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) evidenced the presence of nano-objects with either sponge or hexagonal inverted structure. In the zone of interest, the percentage of each component was determined to obtain both high encapsulation efficiency and small size of particles. Two optimized formulations were found: F7 and F1.

Differentiated Haptic Stimulation by Modal Synthesis of Vibration Field,"To date, Several focusing techniques have been proposed to realize localized stimulation on haptic interfaces: phased arrays of actuators with delayed excitation, or time reversal techniques which require a preliminary learning phase. Additionally, these techniques are sensitive to parameters variation and disturbances. Modal decomposition allows to realize arbitrary vibration fields congruent with the boundary conditions and in this paper, Modal decomposition is proposed to realize a desired vibration velocity field in order to have differentiated stimuli. The experimental results validate the ability of the method to approximate satisfactorily a desired reference form. The psychophysical evaluations show that users can differentiate and localize the stimulation while exploring a surface with two fingers.",['spi']
On the Markov commutator,"The Markov commutator associated to a finite Markov kernel P is the convex semigroup consisting of all Markov kernels commuting with P. Its interest comes from its relation with the hypergroup property and with the notion of Markovian duality by intertwining. In particular, it is shown that the discrete analogue of the Achour-Trimèche's theorem, asserting the preservation of non-negativity by the wave equations associated to certain Metropolis birth and death transition kernels, cannot be extended to all convex potentials. But it remains true for symmetric and monotone potentials which are sufficiently convex.",['shs']
Warehouse performance measurement: classification and mathematical expressions of indicators,"Literature about warehouse performance focuses mainly on the analysis of indicator results, and less attention is given to metric definitions and measurement. This situation generates confusions in the indicator definitions, and different measurements for the same performance indicators could be made by distinct authors. In order to improve this measurement, this paper makes a synthesis of the measures found in literature to evaluate warehouse performance, defining their boundaries and equations. The indicators are classified and grouped according to the dimensions of time, quality, cost and productivity. In order to maintain consistency among metrics from different warehouse areas, a standard warehouse is defined with its layout, activities and indicators measurement units. Then, the indicator definitions found in the literature are analyzed, considering the measurement units defined in the standard warehouse, in order to state indicators with mathematical expressions. The result is a well-defined set of metrics available to companies for a more accurate warehouse management.","['spi', 'shs']"

We create a software based on experimental design and surface profile recording. Using an appropriate database structure, the roughness parameters are automatically computed at different scales. The surface files are saved in a hard disk directory and roughness parameters are computed at different scales. Finally, a statistical analysis system proposes the roughness parameter (or the pair of roughness parameters) that better describe(s) the functionality of the surface and the spatial scales at which the parameter(s) is (are) the more relevant.",['spi']
Increase of the load carrying capacity of aluminium 2024-T3 by means of a NiP-CRC-DLC coating,"The present investigation has been conducted in order to evaluate the tribological behavior of an AA2024-T3 aluminum alloy, coated with a NiP-CrC-DLC coating. The effect of NiP as intermediate layer was evaluated by carrying out calculations using ELASTICA © in order to determine its adequate thickness needed to avoid the plastic deformation of the substrate, ensuring then the integrity of the coating. To evaluate the efficiency of these calculations, a number of dry sliding wear tests were performed employing a ball-on-disk configuration, where alumina balls of 6 mm in diameter were used as counterpart. The sliding wear tests were carried out up to a sliding distance of 800 m, with a normal load of 5 N, a linear speed of 5 cm/s and a contact radius of 3 mm. The wear tracks were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The wear volume was determined by means of optical profilometry. The results indicate that, under the present testing conditions, the NiP-CrC-DLC coating exhibits a satisfactory behavior from the mechanical stability point of view when the thickness of the NiP layer is higher than 60 µm, since no surface failures were observed at the end of the tests. For the coated system, the magnitude of the friction coefficient was found to be of approximately 0.1 and that of the wear rate was of about 2.31 ± 0.09 x 10-16 m3/N.m. On the contrary, for the uncoated substrate, the friction coefficient was of approximately 0.5 and the wear rate of 5.46 x 10-13 m3/N.m, that is to say, 3 orders of magnitude greater than that determined for the coated system.",['spi']
Interactions by exchange of volume between two spherical bubbles,"In this paper, by using the system potential of two bubbles and with a special interest in the interaction by exchange of volume and without exchange of mass, a system of equations governing the evolution of two bubbles is proposed. This two-bubble model shows terms that do not appear in the models of interaction between bubbles. The twobubble model is compared with the modified Rayleigh–Plesset equation and a validation with the experimental study of Ohl [2002] is presented. The numerical results show that, on one hand, the development of small nearby bubbles can slow down the evolution of the biggest local one, while their disappearance can favor its growing. Furthermore, in the case of two bubbles in particular, the small bubble exchanges volume with the big one during their evolutions. On the other hand, contrary to the modified Rayleigh–Plesset model, the two-bubble model predicts appearance and disappearance of small bubbles in the neighborhood of the big bubble as it is observed in the experimental study of Ohl [2002]. The present findings show in particular that the interaction by exchange of volume can be very important in the cavitation born phase and it is necessary to take into account the interaction between bubbles as well as the disappearance of small ones on the evolution of the biggest local bubble. Also, this two-bubble model predicts an exchange of volume between both bubbles equal to zero when they are perfectly identical.","['spi', 'phys']"
Multi-scale approach of the instrumented indentation technique on the fracture toughness estimation,"Instrumented Indentation Technique (IIT) is widely used to determine the mechanical properties of materials. The elastic modulus is usually determined by applying the methodology proposed by Oliver and Pharr [1] who supposed that its value is independent of the indentation depth. However, some authors [2, 3] have observed a decrease of the elastic modulus when the indenter displacement increases which allowed them to introduce a continuous damage theory used afterwards to estimate the fracture toughness of ductile materials. The assumption made by the authors is that a damage in the region very close to the bottom of the indent results in the formation of microvoids which leads to the variation of the elastic modulus as a function of the indenter displacement. Starting from this observation, Lee et al. [2] proposed an energy model based on the Griffith’s theory and the continuous damage mechanics (CDM) which states that the elastic modulus variation is related to the fraction void volume through a variable damage, introduced by Kachanov [4], related to the surface density of the microdefects. On the other hand, the works carried out over ductile materials by Li et al. [3] have been performed only with nanoindentation data preventing a discussion on the scale-­‐effect. (...)",['spi']
Modeling the composite hardness of coated systems involving multilayer coatings,"The change in the composite hardness with penetration depth derived from nanoindentation tests conducted on coated systems, which involve the deposition of multilayer coatings, in general exhibit a complex shape, as a consequence of the sequential contribution of each coating layer to the composite hardness during indentation loading. In spite that there are a number of models, which have been proposed for describing the change of the composite hardness with penetration depth for monolayer coatings, as well as for determining the coating and substrate hardness, very few research works have addressed the problem of describing this kind of data for multilayer coatings. In the present communication, a rational approach is proposed for extending two models widely used for the analysisof monolayer coatings, in order to describe the composite hardness data of multilayer coatings, as well as for determining the hardness of each individual layer and that of the substrate. Thus, a modified form of the models earlier advanced by Korsunsky et al. [1] and Puchi-Cabrera [2], as well as their computational instrumentation, are proposed. The extension of both models to deal with multilayer coatings is conducted on the basis of the model developed by Iost et al. [3], in order to adapt the Jönsson-Hogmark [4] model to the analysis of indentation data of multilayer coatings. The proposed models are validated employing nanoindentation results obtained from a 2024-T6 aluminum alloy coated with a DLC film, employing electroless NiP as intermediate layer (Fig. 1-2), as well as the results obtained for a ZrN/MoN bilayer deposited onto a 316L stainless steel substrate.

Hydroxyapatite-TiO2-SiO2-Coated 316L Stainless Steel for Biomedical Application,"This study investigated the effectiveness of titania (TiO2) as a reinforcing phase in the hydroxyapatite (HAP) coating and silica (SiO2) single-layer as a bond coat between the TiO2-reinforced hydroxyapatite (TiO2/HAP) top layer and 316L stainless steel (316L SS) substrate on the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of the underlying 316L SS metallic implant. Single-layer of SiO2 film was first deposited on 316L SS substrate and studied separately. Water contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer analysis were used to evaluate the hydroxyl group reactivity at the SiO2 outer surface. The microstructural and morphological results showed that the reinforcement of HAP coating with TiO2 and SiO2 reduced the crystallite size and the roughness surface. Indeed, the deposition of 50 vol. % TiO2-reinforced hydroxyapatite layer enhanced the hardness and the elastic modulus of the HAP coating, the introduction of SiO2 inner-layer on the surface of the 316L SS allowed the improvement of the bonding strength and the corrosion resistance as confirmed by scratch studies, nanoindentation and cyclic voltammetry tests.","['sdv', 'spi']"

Gear metrology of statistical tolerancing by numerical simulation,"Tolerance verification permits to check the product conformity and to verify assumptions made by the designer. For conformity assessment, the uncertainty associated with the values of the measurands must be known. In the ISO TS 17450 part 2, the notion of the uncertainty is generalized to the specification and the verification. The uncertainty is divided into correlation uncertainty, specification uncertainty and measurement uncertainty. Correlation uncertainty characterizes the fact that the intended functionality and the controlled characteristics may not be perfectly correlated. Therefore, we propose a new specified characteristics based on the statistical tolerancing approach which is directly in relationship with the design intent: the probability distribution of maximum range of the transmission error (the transmission error is the main source of vibratory and acoustic nuisances), and the evaluation of this characteristic based on 3D acquisition by Monte Carlo simulation and Tooth Contact Analysis. Moreover, the measurement uncertainty of the evaluation of this characteristic is estimated by Monte Carlo Simulation.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
Proposition of an approach applicable during the design process of working equipment to identify potential hazards for workers,"The work of product designers has to evolve in phase with the improvements made to technology and changes in regulations. They have to work on different aspects of a product such as its technological, legal, environmental and occupational safety implications. European directive 2006/42/CE promulgates safe machine design principles to prevent professional risks. These principles guide machine designers to reduce residual risks as much as the technological state of the art permits. Special machine designers are by definition confronted by a lack of specific standards relating to a priori risk analysis. The aim of this paper is to present an original approach to help them to identify hazards upstream and also throughout the design process. This approach is based on the fact that hazards are linked to the presence of energies. Hazard identification can be done through the detection of parameters linked to energy sources and flows. The approach then feeds back information to designers about potential contacts between energies and workers, to highlight the need to add preventive measures. We use the Functional-Structural Model is used to represent the machine energy architecture through the different steps of its lifecycle. Thus it is possible to identify every interface through which energies circulate. These interfaces are defined by two kinds of parameter: energetic parameters (linked to energy properties), and other design parameters. This paper first presents a detailed classification of energetic parameters that are also indicators of the hazards present in the machine. We then present logical rules for processing these energetic parameters and others, in order to increase the accuracy of the hazard identification performed. To conclude, the results obtained from using this approach during the industrial design of a supply line is detailed to validate the pertinence of its application from the earliest design stages, with improved accuracy during the subsequent design stages.",['spi']
Comparison of optimization techniques in a tolerance analysis approach considering form defects,"In tolerancing analysis area, the most various existing approaches do not take form defects of parts into consideration. As high precisions assemblies cannot be analyzed with the assumption that form defects are negligible, the paper focuses in particular on the study of the form defects impacts on the assembly simulation and that by comparing two optimization algorithms (iHLRF and Quapro). The study is limited firstly to the cylinders. For the optimization, two main types of surfaces modelling are considered: difference surface-based method and real model. The compared models allow assessing the non-interferences between cylinders with form defects, potentially in contact. This is in the main issue to validate a tolerance analysis approach.","['info', 'spi']"
A new multi-scale design methodology for the optimisation of variable stiffness composites,"In this work a multi-scale two-level (MS2L) optimisation strategy for optimising VAT composites is presented. In the framework of the MS2L methodology, the design problem is split and solved into two steps. At the first step the goal is to determine the optimum distribution of the laminate stiffness properties over the structure (macroscopic scale), while the second step aims at retrieving the optimum fibres path in each layer meeting all the requirements provided by the problem at hand (mesoscopic scale). The MS2L strategy has been improved in order to integrate all types of requirements (mechanical, manufacturability, geometric, etc.) within the first-level problem. The proposed approach relies on: (a) the polar formalism for describing the behaviour of the VAT laminate, (b) the iso-geometric surfaces for describing the spatial variation of both the laminate stiffness properties (macro-scale) and the layers fibres-path (meso-scale) and (c) an hybrid optimisation tool (genetic and gradient-based algorithms) to perform the solution search. The effectiveness of the MS2L strategy is proven through a numerical example on the maximisation of the first buckling factor of a VAT plate subject to both mechanical and manufacturability constraints.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
Displacement of colloidal dispersions in Porous Media: experimental & numerical approaches,"The main objective of this paper is to give more insight on colloids deposition and re-entrainment in presence of a rough surface. Experiments on retention and release of colloids in a porous medium are first presented. The influence of physicochemical and hydrodynamic conditions is investigated. The experimental results cannot be qualitatively interpreted using the DLVO theory and knowledges at pore scale are then needed. A 3D numerical simulation approach at the pore scale is therefore proposed where the motion of colloids is solved in presence of collector surfaces bearing various kinds of asperities and by taking into account physico-chemical interactions calculated at each time step during colloid movement. It is obviously observed that both deposition and mobilization of particles are dependent on solution chemistry and hydrodynamic conditions and are significantly affected by the form and size of the local roughness of the pore surface. Therefore, depending on solution ionic strength and surface topography, colloids may be adsorbed or not and when a particle is retained an increase of flow strength is then needed to remove it and such an increase is specific to the location of occurrence of the adsorption step. In general, simulation results allow us to explain our experimental results that show that by steeply increasing the flow strength, more and more fractions of particles retained inside the porous medium are released until all particles are removed.","['spi', 'phys']"
Multi-scale identification of elastic properties for anisotropic media through a global hybrid evolutionary-based inverse approach,"One of the main issues of composite materials is related to the difficulty of characterising the full set of material properties at both mesoscopic and microscopic scales. Indeed, classical mechanical tests (traction/compression, 3 or 4 points bending tests, etc.) are not able to provide the full set of 3D material properties of composites. Furthermore, these tests can provide only the in-plane elastic properties of the constitutive lamina (i.e at. the laminate mesoscopic scale). Therefore, in order to go beyond the main restrictions imposed by standard destructive tests, this work deals with the problem of characterising the material properties of a composite plate made of unidirectional fibre-reinforced laminae (at each characteristic scale), through a single non-destructive modal test performed at the macroscale, i.e. that of the specimen (the laminate). To face such a problem a general multi-scale identification strategy (MSIS) is proposed. The MSIS aims at identifying the constitutive properties at both micro and meso scales by exploiting the information restrained in the macroscopic dynamical response of the laminate (e.g. in terms of its eigenfrequencies). The MSIS relies on the one hand on the strain energy homogenisation technique of periodic media (for determining the effective elastic properties of the lamina as a function of the geometrical and material properties of the microscopic constitutive phases) and on the other hand on a special hybrid algorithm (genetic algorithm + gradient-based algorithm) in order to perform the solution search for the considered problem. The identification problem is stated as a constrained inverse problem (a least-square constrained problem), where the objective function depends upon both the measured and evaluated (from finite element analysis) natural frequencies of the laminated plate. In this background, the optimisation variables are both geometrical and material properties of the constitutive phases composing the representative volume element (RVE) of the composite. The effectiveness of the proposed approach will be proven through a campaign of experimental/numerical tests conducted on standard laminates made of unidirectional plies.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"

Weaving Rules into Models@run.time for Embedded Smart Systems,"Smart systems are characterised by their ability to analyse measured data in live and to react to changes according to expert rules. Therefore, such systems exploit appropriate data models together with actions, triggered by domain-related conditions. The challenge at hand is that smart systems usually need to process thousands of updates to detect which rules need to be triggered, often even on restricted hardware like a Raspberry Pi. Despite various approaches have been investigated to efficiently check conditions on data models, they either assume to fit into main memory or rely on high latency persistence storage systems that severely damage the reactivity of smart systems. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel composition process, which weaves executable rules into a data model with lazy loading abilities. We quantitatively show, on a smart building case study, that our approach can handle, at low latency, big sets of rules on top of large-scale data models on restricted hardware.",['info']

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BASELINE CLIMATE OF THE COTNARI (ROMANIA) WINE GROWING REGION,"The paper presents the baseline climate of the Cotnari wine growing region, the climate under whose influence were set up the wine grape varieties, wine types and grapevine training systems of this vineyard. It is also presented the baseline climate suitability for wine grape growing and its spatial variation in the vineyard area. The study is based on the climate data for the 1961 to 1980 time period, previous to the beginning of theclimate warming and, therefore, considered to be representative for the baseline climate time period. According to study results, the baseline climate of the Cotnari wine growing region was cool, with annual average temperatures by 8.5...10.0°C, with a sum of the effective temperatures by1081...1382°C, with freezing phenomena at the beginning and towards the end of the growing season, and with very cool nights during the month of September (CI+2). Elements that generate the baseline climate suitability for wine grape growing were: high average temperatures for the month ofJuly (19...21.1°C); long growing season up to 190 days, and high values for the global radiation, up to 93 kcal/cm2/April 1st-September 30thon the sunny slopes within the vineyard area. According to the multicriteria evaluation of the suitability for wine grape growing, 87.9% (1792 ha) of thevineyard surface was characterized by a baseline climate suitable for white quality wines and 11.9% (241.0 ha) by a baseline climate suitable for white table wines, sparkling wines and wines for distillates.","['sde', 'shs']"

Investigation of Damage in Composites Using Nondestructive Nonlinear Acoustic Spectroscopy,"The presented experimental work describes the nondestructive damage examination of polymer-matrix composites using acoustic methods under the consideration of nonlinear effects. The aim is to analyze these nonlinear effects in order to provide a quantification of the nonlinear acoustic transmission which is related to the damage state and its severity in the composite material. The first objective was to study the effectiveness of the distortion evaluation method and its related parameter: the BTotal Difference Frequency Distortion^ (TDFD) parameter. The TDFD was utilized as a new damage indicator to quantify the progressive damage state in composite materials. The TDFD method had initially been proposed to characterize the distortion of audio amplifiers. A custom-made setup was developed that imposes acoustic signals to the structure. The samples’ vibrations were afterwards analyzed by a laser vibrometer and further spectrum evaluations. The developed method was applied to two composite materials, both reinforced with taffeta woven glass-fibers, but having different thermoset polymer matrix, i.e. vinylester and epoxy. The damage was introduced in the specimen by tensile tests with a stepwise increase of the tension loading. It was observed that damage influences the intensity of nonlinear intermodulation after having introduced two harmonic and constant signals of different and randomly chosen frequencies in the specimen. The nonlinear intermodulation was then quantified by computing the TDFD parameter. In the specific case of epoxy based composites, high frequency peaks were noted for the high tensile loading levels only. The TDFD parameter was then modified in order to take into account this effect. For both studied composites, the modified TDFD parameter increases with the damage accumulation caused by the applied stepwise tensile loading.",['spi']
Kinematic Field Measurements During Orthogonal Cutting Tests via DIC with Double-frame Camera and Pulsed Laser Lighting,"The measurement of machined-part strain fields induced by the cutting process remains a challenge because of the presence of highly intensive and localised strains. In this study, a high-speed double-frame imaging device with pulsed laser lighting is used in order to obtain sharp and highly resolved images during orthogonal cutting tests performed in an aluminium alloy. The displacement fields are then measured using a global Q4–digital-image-correlation (DIC) method and several strategies, facilitating calculation of the total displacements due to the cut, along with the residual strains in the machined part. Numerical procedures are developed to manage the removed material that disturbs the DIC. An automatic primary shear angle detection procedure using DIC is also proposed. Five different markings, which are produced via chemical etching and micro blasting, are applied to the observed surfaces. Their effects on the kinematic fields and the uncertainties are then studied. Three surface parameters are proposed as indicators for determining the surface preparation suitability for the DIC. The repeatability of the kinematic fields induced during the cutting process is studied, because of the ease with which testing can be performed. Finally, the plastically deformed layer engendered by the cutting process is measured using the calculated residual strains.",['spi']
Stress measurements by multi-reflection grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction method (MGIXD) using different radiation wavelengths and different incident angles,"The presented study introduces the development of the multi-reflection grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction method (MGIXD) for residual stress determination. The proposed new methodology is aimed at obtaining more reliable experimental data and increasing the depth of non-destructive stress determination below the sample surface. To verify proposed method measurements were performed on a classical X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation) and using synchrotron radiation (three different wavelengths: λ = 1.2527 Å, λ = 1.5419 Å and λ = 1.7512 Å). The Al2017 alloy subjected to three different surface treatments was investigated in this study. The obtained results showed that the proposed development of MGIXD method, in which not only different incident angles but also different wavelengths of X-ray are used, can be successfully applied for residual stress determination, especially when stress gradients are present in the sample.",['spi']
Martensitic transformation induced by single shot peening in a metastable austenitic stainless steel 301LN: Experiments and numerical simulation,"During conventional shot peening on metastable austenitic steels, martensitic transformation occurs in addition to plastic straining. In this work, the impact of a single spherical steel shot on a AISI 301LN steel was studied. The volume fraction of martensite, residual stresses in both phases were determined in the vicinity of the dent as a function of the shot velocity and diameter. An elasto-plastic two phase model that includes martensitic phase transformation was adapted to model mechanical and microstructural fields and implemented in Abaqus Explicit for the 2D simulation of a single shot impact. It was found, for instance, that the martensitic transformation takes place only under the dent and that martensite is in tension at the surface while austenite is in compression. Simulation results of stress levels showed a good agreement with experimental stresses determined by X-ray Diffraction.",['spi']
Experimental study of Built-Up Layer formation during machining of High Strength free cutting steel,"Machinability of high-strength steels can be improved without degrading the mechanical properties using metallurgical solutions to create or retain non-metallic inclusions. Such a metallurgical treatment usually leads, during machining, to the appearance of so-called Built-Up Layers (BULs) or transfer layers on the cutting tool. These BULs protect the tool against wear, and longer tool life or better productivity is achieved. Formation of such BULs on the cutting tool depends on many parameters i.e. tool geometry, tool material, cutting conditions. This paper proposes an experimental methodology to identify and describe BUL occurring on the tool rake face. Machining tests were carried out with a high strength free-cutting steel using an untested AlSiTiN coated carbide tool. BULs morphology and composition were determined for various cutting conditions. Temperature distributions at the tool-chip interface were measured during the cutting tests using an infrared camera. BUL appearance was then linked to the thermo-mechanical conditions at the tool-chip interface.",['spi']
Effect of the inverse Langevin approximation on the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation of non-linear dilute polymer,"The Langevin function is defined by L (x ) = coth (x ) −1 /x . Its inverse is useful for many applications and especially for polymer science. As the inverse exact expression has no analytic representation, many ap- proximations have been established. The most famous approximation is the one traditionally used for the finitely extensible non-linear elastic (FENE) dumbbell model in which the inverse is approximated by L −1 (y ) = 3 y/ (1 −y 2 ) . Recently Martin Kröger has published a paper entitled ‘Simple, admissible and accurate approximations of the inverse Langevin and Brillouin functions, relevant for strong polymer de- formation and flows’ (Kröger, 2015) in which he proposed approximations with very reduced error in relation to the numeric inverse of the Langevin function. The question we aim to analyze in this short communication is: when one uses the traditional approximation rather than the more accurate one pro- posed by Kröger is that really significant regarding the value of the probability distribution function (PDF) in the frame work of a kinetic theory simulation? If yes when we move to the upper scale by evaluating the value of the stress, can we observe a significant difference? By making some simple 1D simulations in homogeneous extensional flow it is demonstrated in this short communication that the PDF prediction within kinetic theory framework as well as the macroscopic stress value are both affected by the quality of the approximation.",['spi']
Assessment of the constitutive law by inverse methodology: Small punch test and hardness,"The relevance of small-punch tests and indentation (hardness) tests are compared with regard to the determination of a constitutive law in the case of non active ferrite–bainite steel taken from a French power plant. Firstly, small-punch tests were performed on material samples and the load deflection curves were compared with finite element calculations using the FORGE2 Standard code. As a result the strength coefficient and the strain hardening exponent of Hollomon’s constitutive law were determined by an inverse method (Simplex method). Besides, it was shown that a three-parameter constitutive law such as Ludwik Hollomon’s leads to an indetermination since its parameters are correlated with each other. Secondly indentation tests were performed with a ball indenter and the parameters of the constitutive law were determined from the analysis of the load–indentation depth curves. Both methods give results in good agreement with the true stress–true strain curve obtained by classical tensile testing, thus proving their applicability to nuclear materials.",['spi']
Experimental and numerical analysis of the selective laser sintering (SLS) of PA12 and PEKK semi-crystalline polymers,"A dual experimental-numerical approach was carried out to estimate thermal cycles and resulting fusion depths obtained during the selective laser sintering (SLS) of two polymers: PA12 and PEKK. The validation of thermal cycles was obtained by considering fusion depths on single layers for different experimental conditions and temperature measurements with IR thermal camera. It was shown that a simple Beer-Lambert's heat deposit equation incorporating an extinction coefficient determined experimentally and an efficiency ratio including both laser absorption and diffusion in the powder bed were sufficient for determining accurately fusion depths, and heat cycles for the two polymers. This allowed determining optimum process conditions for manufacturing additive layers on a specifically-designed SLS set-up.",['spi']
A physical-based constitutive model for surface integrity prediction in machining of OFHC copper,"Due to the rising interest in predicting machined surface integrity and sustainability, various models for metal cutting simulation have been developed. However, their accuracy depends deeply on the physical description of the machining process. This study aims to develop an orthogonal cutting model for surface integrity prediction, which includes a physical-based constitutive model of Oxygen Free High Conductivity (OFHC) copper. This constitutive model incorporates the effects of the state of stress and microstructure on the work material behavior, as well as a dislocation density-based model for surface integrity prediction. The coefficients of the constitutive model were identified through a hybrid experimental/numerical approach, consisting in mechanical tests, numerical simulations and an optimization-based algorithm. The orthogonal cutting model was simulated by FEM, using ALE formulation, and was validated by comparing predicted and measured results, including residual stresses, dislocation density and grain size. The model is then used to analyze the influence of the cutting parameters and cutting geometry on surface integrity, and its results are compared to those obtained by the Johnson-Cook model.",['spi']
Fundamental study of exit burr formation mechanisms during orthogonal cutting of AlSi aluminium alloy,"Burr formation during machining is an important issue in industry. It causes an additional deburring operation, which is time consuming and has a negative economic impact. This study aims to analyse burr formation mechanisms and its accumulation in successive passes during orthogonal cutting of a cast aluminium alloy. A customized experimental setup was developed, which includes a high speed imaging system and a laser profilometer. A design of experiments using the setup mentioned previously is carried out and a methodology for geometric burr characterization is developed and applied. Furthermore, statistical representation of the obtained results is performed, which allows the understanding of the geometric heterogeneity influence associated to burr formation mechanisms and to work material microstructure. Based on the exit burr analysis, new geometrical criteria are proposed for the characterisation and the definition of two main burr formation mechanisms. The influence of cutting parameters on burr morphology along the workpiece exit edge is investigated in depth. The results show that two types of burrs can be produced simultaneously along the workpiece exit edge due to the work material microstructure heterogeneity. The results present as well the influence of low uncut chip thickness that leads to a higher proportion of burrs without chamfer. This type of burr is higher and more propice to burr accumulation. After performing several cutting passes, these burrs may be eliminated and replaced by a burr with chamfer.",['spi']
KGmax curves associated with second generation intact stability criteria for different types of ships,"Currently, second generation intact stability criteria are being developed and evaluated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In this paper, we briefly present levels 1 and 2 assessment methods for the criteria of pure loss of stability and parametric roll failure modes. Subsequently, we show the KGmax curves associated with these criteria. We compute these curves for five different types of ships and compare them with the curves embodied in the current regulations. The results show that the safety margin ensured by the first level-1 method of calculation for both pure loss of stability and parametric roll seems to be excessive in many cases. They also show that the KGmax given by the second level-1 method and by the level-2 method may be very similar. In some cases, the level-2 method can be more conservative than the second level-1 method, which is unanticipated by the future regulation. The KGmax curves associated with parametric roll confirm that the C11 container ship is vulnerable to this failure mode. The computation of the second check coefficient of parametric roll level 2 (C2) for all possible values of KG reveals the existence of both authorized and restricted areas on the surface formed by both the draft and KG, which may replace the classical KGmax curves. In consequence, it is not sufficient to check that C2 is lower than the maximum authorized value (RPR0) for a fixed ship’s loading condition.",['spi']
A numerical investigation on the drainage of a surfactant-modified water droplet in paraffin oil,"A volume of fluid approach is used in numerical simulations of the settling motion of a surfactant modified water droplet in a continuous paraffin oil phase. The droplet is millimeter-sized and confined in a square two dimensional domain. The surfactant interfacial and bulk concentration-equations are solved together with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The role of boundary walls in the overall settling dynamics is described. As the droplet moves downwards the interfacial shear creates non-homogeneous interfacial surfactant concentrations and Marangoni driven phenomena come into play. A decrease of the drainage velocity is then evidenced indicating that buoyancy forces are counter balanced by Marangoni induced lift-forces. The lateral migration of the droplet due to boundary wall proximity is discussed. It is shown to increase with wall proximity and to decrease when increasing the interfacial concentration. Finally, a simplified model is used to investigate the evolution of the bulk concentration assuming the surfactant is insoluble in paraffin oil and poorly soluble in water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Correlation of the high and very high cycle fatigue response of ferrite based steels with strain rate-temperature conditions,"The discrepancies observed between conventional and ultrasonic fatigue testing are assessed through the mechanisms of dislocation mobility in BCC metals. The existence of a transition condition between thermally-activated and athermal regimes for screw dislocation mobility is studied under fatigue loading based on infrared thermography and microstructural characterization, here in the case of DP600 dual-phase steel. Evidence is obtained regarding the microstructural sources of crack initiation, which is found to be consistent with the existence of a transition in the modes of deformation. From the analysis of the experimental data gathered in this work, guidelines are given regarding the comparison and interpretation of S-N curves obtained from conventional and ultrasonic fatigue testing. The inevitable temperature increases under ultrasonic fatigue at high stress amplitudes along with the rate dependent deformation behavior of ferrite, as a BCC structure, were found as the key parameters explaining the observed fatigue behavior and thermal response under low and ultrasonic frequencies. A transition map was produced using the experimental results for DP600 steel as well as data available in the literature for other ferrite based steels, showing the correlation between thermally-activated screw dislocation movement and the absence of failure in very high cycle fatigue.",['spi']
Evaluation of morphological representative sample sizes for nanolayered polymer blends,"The size of representative microstructural samples obtained from atomic force microscopy is addressed in this paper. The case of an archetypal one-dimensional nanolayered polymer blend is considered. Image analysis is performed on micrographs obtained through atomic force microscopy, yielding statistical data concerning morphological properties of the material. The variability in terms of microstructural morphology is due to the thermomechanical processing route. The statistical data is used in order to estimate sample size representativity, based on an asymptotic relationship relating the inherent point variance of the indicator function of one material phase to the statistical, size-dependent, ensemble variance of the same function. From the study of nanolayered material systems, the statistical approach was found to be an effective mean for discriminating and characterizing multiple scales of heterogeneity.","['chim', 'math', 'info', 'spi', 'phys']"
Laser offset welding of AZ31B magnesium alloy to 316 stainless steel,"In this paper, the feasibility of using a fiber laser to perform a dissimilar metal joining was explored. AZ31B magnesium and 316 stainless steel were autogenously joined in butt configuration. The weldability between different materials is often compromised by a large difference in thermal properties and poor metallurgical compatibility. Thus, the beam was focused onto the top surface of the magnesium plate, at a certain distance from the interfaces (offset), and without using any interlayer or groove preparation. Such a method was called laser offset welding (LOW). Results proved a very good capability. The ultimate tensile strength exceeded the value of 100 MPa, since a resistant and thin layer of hard intermetallic compounds is formed within the fusion zone. The rupture was observed within the magnesium side, far from the centerline. The metallurgy of fusion zone indicated the effectiveness of phases coalescence, without mixing at liquid states. LOW was demonstrated to be a promising technique to join dissimilar metal welds, being capable to produce an effective bonding with good tensile strength.",['spi']
Spatial variability of topsoil characteristics within one silty soil type. Effects on clay migration,"In order to understand and to model soil runoff erosion as well as to optimize sampling schemes, improved understanding of spatial variability of clay and some other soil erosion parameters is needed. For this purpose, two complementary approaches to the study of spatial variability of silty topsoil characteristics, the pedological approach and the fractal approach applied to geostatistics, were carried out in the context of soil erosion within the intensive cereal agriculture zone of North Western Europe. Fractals geometry provides one synthetic key to the description of classical geostatistical tools such as variograms. Spatial structure of soil properties of each of the three topsoil pedological units were mostly characterized along the slope by the ranges of the fractal one-dimensional space domains and their scale invariants : the fractal dimensions. Results suggest that, within each topsoil pedological unit, these scale invariants are relevant qualifiers of the intrinsic topsoil variability, which can be modelled as a fractal Brownian process and should be incorporated in simple recursive or complex network soil erosion models.",['sde']
"Dioxin and 1,2-dichlorobenzene adsorption in aluminosilicate zeolite Beta","The influence of sodium cations content in zeolite Beta crystals of different sizes (between 200 nm and 2 μm) on the adsorption of pollutants (dioxin and polychlorobenzene) is investigated. In this study, protons which balance the negative charge of the zeolitic framework are partially replaced by sodium cations. Chemical, structural and textural analyses performed on the exchanged crystals indicate that the exchange rates reached 75–80 % and that the structure of zeolites is preserved. Adsorptions of pollutants in zeolite Beta samples were successfully carried out using 1,2-dichlorobenzene (gas phase) and 2,3-DiChloroDibenzo-p-Dioxin: 2,3-DCDD (liquid phase) but reveal different behaviors. Indeed, all samples adsorb the same amount (around 7 molecules) of 1,2-dichlorobenzene per unit-cell of zeolite, whereas the dioxin adsorption amounts increase with the amount of sodium cations. Compared to their protonic forms, the dioxin adsorption capacities were multiplied by a factor of 1.3 for the sodium exchanged small crystals (size between 200 nm and 1 μm) and by a factor of 4 for the sodium exchanged microcrystals (size between 1 and 2 μm) for an equilibrium concentration of 2,3-DCDD of 0.5 mmol/L in both cases.",['chim']
"Thermodynamic, kinetic and conformational analysis of proteins diffusion–sorption on a solid surface","In this paper we examine particularly some of the more fundamental properties of protein conformational changes at a solid surface coupled with diffusion from the bulk of an aqueous solution and with the adsorption-desorption processes. We focus our attention on adsorbed protein monolayers upon a solid surface using a thermodynamic and kinetic analytical development Account is also taken of the effects on the overall rate of the conformational change on a solid surface of deviation from ideality, of protein flexibility, of surface free energy and of interaction with reactive solid sites. Our theory applied to steady states is illustrated by examples such as folding-misfolding-unfolding of RNase and SNase on a solid surface after diffusion and adsorption from an aqueous solution. For this purpose, we put forward the determining steps which shall lead to the steady state. The existence of three situations is highlighted according to the values of the typical constants relevant for the protein considered: reaction rate determining step, diffusion and sorption determining steps, mixed adsorption diffusion and reaction rate. Finally, we have tried to link the developments of our theories to a large literature based on experimental results encountered during proteins diffusion-sorption-reaction processes, fundamental topics that has been since long investigated by Miller's team in MPKG.",['chim']
Effects of crystal preferred orientation on upper-mantle flow near plate boundaries: rheologic feedbacks and seismic anisotropy,"Insight into upper-mantle processes can be gained by linking flow-induced mineral alignment to regional deformation and seismic anisotropy patterns. Through a series of linked micro–macro scale numerical experiments, we explore the rheologic effects of crystal preferred orientation (CPO) and evaluate the magnitude of possible impacts on the pattern of flow and associated seismic signals for mantle that includes a cooling, thickening young oceanic lithosphere. The CPO and associated anisotropic rheology, computed by a micromechanical polycrystal model, are coupled with a large scale flow model (Eulerian Finite Element method) via a local viscosity tensor field, which quantifies the stress:strain rate response of a textured polycrystal. CPO is computed along streamlines throughout the model space and the corresponding viscosity tensor field at each element defines the local properties for the next iteration of the flow field. Stable flow and CPO distributions were obtained after several iterations for the two dislocation glide cases tested: linear and nonlinear stress:strain rate polycrystal behaviour. The textured olivine polycrystals are found to have anisotropic viscosity tensors in a significant portion of the model space. This directional dependence in strength impacts the pattern of upper-mantle flow. For background asthenosphere viscosity of ∼1020 Pa s and a rigid lithosphere, the modification of the corner flow pattern is not drastic but the change could have geologic implications. Feedback in the development of CPO occurs, particularly in the region immediately below the base of the lithosphere. Stronger fabric is predicted below the flanks of a spreading centre for fully coupled, power-law polycrystals than was determined using prior linear, intermediate coupling polycrystal models. The predicted SKS splitting is modestly different (∼0.5 s) between the intermediate and fully coupled cases for oceanic plates less than 20 Myr old. The magnitude of azimuthal anisotropy for surface waves, on the other hand, is predicted to be twice as large for fully coupled power-law flow/polycrystals than for linear, intermediate coupled flow/polycrystal models.",['phys']
Flexibility of suckler cattle farms in the face of uncertainty within the beef industry. A proposed definition,"L'objectif de l'étude est d'analyser l'intérêt de la notion de flexibilité, proposée par les sciences de gestion, pour qualifier la capacité de réponse des systèmes d'élevage bovins allaitants aux aléas de la filière (notamment les crises de la vache folle et de le fièvre aphteuse en 2000/2001). Cinq enquêtes successives ont été réalisées dans 14 élevages de Saône-et-Loire avec chacune une entrée différente : la caractérisation de la trajectoire depuis l'installation, les pratiques économiques et commerciales et la conduite technique. Une série de variables est proposée et plusieurs hypothèses sont formulées quant à leur relation avec la flexibilité des élevages. Cinq groupes d'élevages ont été identifiés, sur la base de combinaisons de ces variables, chaque groupe étant associé à différents niveaux de flexibilité technique, économique et commerciale des systèmes considérés. L'analyse montre que ces registres de flexibilité peuvent soient être complémentaires, soit être antagonistes selon les situations. Dans les systèmes traditionnels herbagers extensifs, la complémentarité leur a permis d'être insensible aux crises de la filière. Dans les autres cas, une moindre flexibilité conduit soit à une certaine inertie (pas de capacité à réagir), soit à la recherche de solutions d'adaptation ailleurs que dans l'élevage stricto sensu (vente directe), voire dans d'autres productions (volailles, vigne ). La flexibilité nous semble être un critère important à prendre en compte pour les actions de développement, en fonction des situations et des aspirations des éleveurs","['sdv', 'shs']"
Burst size matters: when node degree helps accelerate opportunistic dissemination,"Disseminating large files in opportunistic networks requires splitting the content into smaller pieces in order to leverage short contacts between nodes on the move. A negative consequence of content chopping is that it may generate significant overhead, as nodes have to exchange more signaling information to determine which pieces the neighbor misses. In this paper, we investigate the convenience of exchanging a burst of pieces at once at the risk of sending redundant pieces. Although achieving a good tradeoff between signaling reduction and redundant transmissions is challenging, we found out that node degree is a good indicator to determine burst size. We propose a distributed multi-content dissemination protocol with an adaptive burst dimensioning based on the device neighborhood density.We score its performance using both synthetic mobility traces and a testbed composed of real mobile devices and finely monitor the behavior of the protocol by deploying passive monitors in the target area. Our experiments show that our proposal achieves much faster dissemination than related alternatives that employ a fixed burst size. As a matter of fact, our work provides insights into the necessity of adopting adaptive strategies in practical situations involving device-to-device content dissemination.",['info']
Rib Cage Measurement Reproducibility Using Biplanar Stereoradiographic 3D Reconstructions in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis,"Study design: A reproducibility study of preoperative rib cage 3D measurements was conducted for patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS). Objective: to assess the reliability of rib cage 3D reconstructions using biplanar stereoradiography in patients with AIS before surgery. Summary: no prior reliability study has been performed for preoperative 3D reconstructions of the rib cage by using stereoradiography in patients with preoperative AIS. Materials: this series includes 21 patients with Lenke 1 or 2 scoliosis (74°+ - 20). All patients underwent low-dose standing biplanar radiographs. Two operators performed reconstructions twice each. Intraoperator repeatability, interoperator reproducibility and Intraclass coefficients (ICC) were calculated and compared between groups. Results: The average rib cage volume was 4.7l L (SD ± 0.75 L). SDr was 0.19 L with a coefficient of variation of 4.1% ; ICC was 0.968. The thoracic index was 0.6 (SD ± 0.1). SDr was 0.03 with a coefficient of variation of 4.7 % and a ICC of 0.820. As for the Spinal Penetration Index (6.4% ; SD ± 2.4), SDr was 0.9 % with a coefficient of variation of 14.3 % and a ICC of 0.901. The 3D rib hump SDr (average 27° ± 8°) was 1.4°. The coefficient of variation and ICC were respectively 5.1% and 0.991. Conclusion: 3D reconstruction of the rib cage using biplanar stereoradiography is a reliable method to estimate preoperative thoracic parameters in patients with AIS.","['sdv', 'spi']"
Relative reticulo-rumen pH indicators for subacute ruminal acidosis detection in dairy cows,"Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is usually characterized by abnormal and intermittent drops in rumen pH. Nevertheless, high individual animal variability in rumen pH and the difference in measurement methods for pH data acquisition decrease the sensitivity and accuracy of pH indicators for detecting SARA in ruminants. The aim of this study was to refine rumen pH indicators in long-term SARA based on individual dairy cow reticulo-rumen pH kinetics. Animal performances and rumen parameters were studied weekly in order to validate SARA syndrome and rumen pH was continuously measured using reticulo-rumen sensors. In total, 11 primiparous dairy cows were consecutively fed two different diets for 12 successive weeks: a control diet as low-starch diet (LSD; 13% starch for 4 weeks in period 1), an acidotic diet as high-starch diet (HSD; 32% starch for 4 weeks in period 2), and again the LSD diet (3 weeks in period 3). There was a 1-week dietary transition between LSD and HSD. Commonly used absolute SARA pH indicators such as daily average, area under the curve (AUC) and time spent below pH <5.8 and pH <6 were processed from absolute (raw) daily kinetics. Then signal processing was applied to raw pH values in order to calculate relative pH indicators by filtering and normalizing data to remove inter-individual variability, sensor drift and sensor noise. Normalized AUC, times spent below NpH <− 0.3 and NpH <− 0.5, NpH range and NpH standard deviation were calculated. Those relative pH indicators were compared with commonly used pH indicators to assess their ability to detect SARA. This syndrome induced by HSD was confirmed by consistent expected changes in milk quality, dry matter intake and acetate : propionate ratio in the rumen, whereas the ruminal concentration of lipopolysaccharide was increased. Commonly used pH SARA indicators were not able to discriminate SARA syndrome due to high animal variability and sensor drift and noise, whereas relative pH indicators developed in this study appeared more relevant for SARA detection as assessed by receiver operating characteristic tests. This work shows that absolute pH kinetics should be corrected for drift, noise and animal variability to produce relative pH indicators that are more robust for SARA detection. These relative pH indicators could be more relevant for identifying affected animals in a herd and also for comparing SARA risk among studies.",['sdv']
Effects of front-of-pack labels on the nutritional quality of supermarket food purchases: evidence from a large-scale randomized controlled trial,"To examine whether four pre-selected front-of-pack nutrition labels improve food purchases in real-life grocery shopping settings, we put 1.9 million labels on 1,266 food products in four categories in 60 supermarkets and analyzed the nutritional quality of 1,668,301 purchases using the FSA nutrient profiling score. Effect sizes were 17 times smaller on average than those found in comparable laboratory studies. The most effective nutrition label, Nutri-Score, increased the purchases of foods in the top third of their category nutrition-wise by 14%, but had no impact on the purchases of foods with medium, low, or unlabeled nutrition quality. Therefore, Nutri-Score only improved the nutritional quality of the basket of labeled foods purchased by 2.5% (-0.142 FSA points). Nutri-Score’s performance improved with the variance (but not the mean) of the nutritional quality of the category. In-store surveys suggest that Nutri-Score’s ability to attract attention and help shoppers rank products by nutritional quality may explain its performance.",['shs']
Modelling the effects of wood cambial age on the effective modulus of elasticity of poplar laminated veneer lumber,"Key messageA modelling method is proposed to highlight the effect of cambial age on the effective modulus of elasticity of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) according to bending direction and veneer thickness. This approach is relevant for industrial purposes in order to optimize the performance of LVL products.ContextLVL is used increasingly in structural applications. It is obtained from a peeling process, where product’s properties depend on cambial age, hence depend on radial position in the log.AimsThis study aims to highlight how radial variations of properties and cambial age impact the mechanical behaviour of LVL panels.MethodsAn analytical mechanical model has been designed to predict the modulus of elasticity of samples made from poplar LVL panels. The originality of the model resides in the integration of different data from the literature dealing with the variation in wood properties along the radius of the log. The simulation of the peeling process leads to veneers with different mechanical properties, which are randomly assembled in LVL panels.ResultsThe model shows a correct mechanical behaviour prediction in comparison with experimental results of the literature, in particular with the decrease in MOE in LVL made of juvenile wood. It highlights that the bending direction and veneer thickness have no influence on the average MOE, but affect MOE dispersion.ConclusionThis paper proposed an adequate model to predict mechanical behaviour in the elastic domain of LVL panels based on the properties of raw wood material.",['spi']

Joint Ownership of Production Projects as a Commitment Device against Interest Groups,"This paper investigates an unexplored rationale for joint ownership of a production project. We model projects with autocorrelated productivity shocks as creating an option value of investing over time so that later investments benefit from the information revealed by the realization of earlier investments. However, internal and external interest groups may pressurize owners into paying out early revenues. Joint ownership provides a commitment mechanism against them, thereby enabling more efficient levels of investment. The Business Environment and Enterprises Performance survey data corroborate the model's prediction that organizations under interest-group lobbying pressure are more likely to choose joint ownership.",['shs']

The design worked out on the exact sampled-data model of a mechanical system confirms the effectiveness of the controller.",['spi']
A multipath prefix routing for wireless sensor networks,"When a spanning tree is built on top of a wireless network and an appropriate labelling scheme is applied, the complexity of the routing mechanism in terms of memory usage and control messages can be drastically reduced using compact routing. In this paper, we propose multipath prefix routing (MPR), a multipath routing protocol for wireless sensor networks. MPR is a hybrid (both reactive and proactive) protocol that operates on an already built spanning tree rooted at the sink (the collect station). Besides the tree path, additional paths are built based on an appropriate labelling scheme and neighbourhood relationships. For practical implementation, we propose and evaluate two different labelling schemes. We mainly show that in a perfect W-ary tree, the additional number of bits required to encode labels is at most (H−1)(H−1) where H is the height of the tree. Finally, we apply MPR to the ZigBee standard and evaluate its performance using simulations. MPR has a small state routing while control messages overhead is maintained low compared to traditional multipath routing protocols.",['info']
A proposed framework of sustainable self-evaluation maturity within companies: an exploratory study,"Companies are still struggling to implement ecodesign in their daily product development processes. It is believed that this occurs because companies should firstly improve their strategy and management skills towards sustainability before introducing any ecodesign tool. As a consequence, this paper aims to propose a self­evaluation framework to rank companies into different classes according to their level of maturity in terms of sustainability. It also discusses ̈minimum requirements ̈ to move from one level to another towards sustainability. This will help companies to better understand which strategic and managerial actions they need to take before implementing any ecodesign.",['spi']
A risk-based approach to drive conceptual design taking into account low-maturity products,"The presence of immature concepts makes difficult decision making at upstream phase of a development project. Rework tasks in collaborative development projects dealing with immature design concepts are very frequent and are responsible of cost overruns and schedule delays. In addition, decisions taken during conceptual design stage have the most important influence on product life cycle cost. In this context, a useful practice is to develop two or more concepts in parallel and delay decision making. Even so, a first screening of concepts is usually needed because of the substantial resources and time required in development phase. In this paper, an approach of concepts screening is proposed at conceptual design phase on the basis of two metrics. The first assesses ability of concepts to meet requirements with integration of maturity. Fuzzy logic tools are used to capture and propagate imprecision in embodiment design choices and behavior models. The second metric aims to assess expected performance of novel concepts compared with an existent product. It uses generalized ordered weighted averaging (GOWA) operator. A parametric aggregation function is also proposed as a support when using the two metrics. The proposed approach was applied to the development of a solar collector.",['spi']
Towards additive manufacturing of intermediate objects (AMIO) for concepts generation,"According to an analysis of existing Design For Additive Manufacturing (DFAM)methods,we first highlight that they present limits regarding product innovation. This paper then presents a creative approach to be integrated in the early stages of DFAMmethods. Two case studiesA and B are presented as the experimental application of the first stage of our creative approach. The results of these case studies highlight that designers need a newkind of IntermediateRepresentation (IR), especially to represent dynamic features. To address this need, we introduce the concept of AMIO Additive Manufacturing of Intermediate Objects. This new kind of IR is an expected output of the ideas generation stage. These intermediate objects are meant to be manipulated by all the design stakeholders, as an input for the concept generation stage, to enhance the generation of creative concepts for additive manufacturing.",['spi']
Safety of machinery: requirement specification based on functional need and work situations analysis,"This paper describe the ongoing work jointly between INRS and LCFC/ENSAM to take risk prevention into account in the specification drawn up when considering buying or designing work equipment (special machine, individual workstation, assembly line, etc…). The methodology is based on the functional need analysis and the concept of work situations as defined by INRS in their previous research work. The aim is to bring together the “user” and the “designer” in a dynamic of dialogue, in order to define the main work situations and not only the technical system. An overview of the problem is first described, followed by a brief review of methods currently in use. We then describe the different steps involved in the proposed methodology, before examining the results of a case-study application to a milling machine in which the benefits of such an approach and its acceptability by SME/SMIs are assessed.",['spi']
Multi-user interface for co-located real-time work with digital mock-up: a way to foster collaboration?,"Nowadays more and more industrial design activities adopt the strategy of Concurrent Engineering (CE), which changes the way to carry out all the activities along the product’s lifecycle from sequential to parallel. Various experts of different activities produce technical data using domain-specific software. To augment the interoperability among the technical data, a Digital Mock-Up (DMU), or a Building Information Model (BIM) in architectural engineering can be used. Through an appropriate Computer–Human Interface (CHI), each expert has his/her own point-of-view (POV) of a specific representation of DMU’s technical data according to an involved domain. When multiple experts work collaboratively in the same place and at the same time, the number of CHIs is also multiplied by the number of experts. Instead of multiple CHIs, therefore, a unique CHI should be developed to support the multiview and multi-interaction collaborative works. Our contributions in this paper are (a) a concept of a CHI system with multi-view and multi-interaction of DMU for multiple users in collaborative design; (b) a state of the art of multi-view and multi-interaction metaphors; (c) an experiment to evaluate a collaborative application using multi-view CHI. The experimental results indicate that, in multi-view CHI working condition, users are more efficient than in the other two working conditions (multiple CHIs and split view CHI). Moreover, in multi-view CHI working condition, the user, who is helping the other, takes less mutual awareness of where the other collaborator works than the other two working conditions.",['info']
Environmental-energy analysis and the importance of design and remanufacturing recycled materials,"This paper proposes a framework that interrelates the life cycle of the product, remanufacturing and recycling for plastics. The paper analyses the different chemical processes of recycling polymer wastes. We introduce a thermodynamic calculation of the energy consumed and CO2 emissions for all types of waste (municipal, electronic, vehicle). The remanufacturing process could reduce the amount of CO2 emissions through feedback to the product design stage with robust platforms that extend the product life cycle. In order to meet the requirements of remanufacturing we combine mechanical and chemical recycling solutions. These recycling processes must undergo a thermodynamic analysis to optimize energy and decrease the minimum CO2 emissions, i.e. recycling processes in line with the ultimate objective, which isthe reduction of CO2 emissions and slowing a part of the problem global warming.","['sde', 'spi']"
The concept of genus within the family Phytoseiidae (Acari: Parasitiformes): historical review and phylogenetic analyses of the genus Neoseiulus Hughes,"Systematic studies on the family Phytoseiidae were first conducted at the beginning of the 20th century but increased greatly after the Second World War. Various classifications have been proposed based on different characters such as: dorsal, ventral, and leg chaetotaxy; the shape of ventrianal and sternal shields; the shape of the insemination apparatus (spermatheca) and spermatodactylus; the number of teeth on the movable digit of chelicera; and dorsal and ventral adenotaxy. The genus concepts developed over the last five decades can be divided into two main categories or hypotheses. The first, supported mainly by Chant and McMurtry, focuses on dorsal and ventral chaetotaxy, and the genera so defined usually include a great number of species. The second category, proposed by Athias-Henriot, considers the shape of the insemination apparatus as the key character, and the genera so defined usually include a limited number of species. From a diagnostic point of view, both classifications have a valid structure, but the question investigated herein was: which of the two classifications or hypotheses fits phylogenetic evolution? To answer this, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses (using the genes ITS and 12S rRNA) on the genus Neoseiulus, which has been subjected to classification based on the two main genus concepts. The results showed that the first hypothesis (Chant and McMurtry) leads to polyphyly of the genus Neoseiulus, while the second (Athias-Henriot) leads to paraphyly of the genus. The results show that acarologists who first decided that the insemination apparatus was of evolutive importance could be correct as the shape of the insemination apparatus seems to better fit evolutive clades than dorsal and ventral chaetotaxy. The morphology of this organ, however, must be more accurately studied to better define homologies. The present paper investigates the two main hypotheses proposed until now for classification of Phytoseiidae and thereby opens the way for improved classification.",['sdv']
Internal Stress Analysis for the Damage Study of a 16MND5 Bainitic Steel,"The behavior and the fracture mechanisms of the 16MND5 bainitic pressure vessel steel are studied using a local approach of fracture on a crystallographic scale. A series of tensile tests are performed on the material at various temperatures ranging from - 96°C to -60°C: the damage is observed with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) while the residual stresses in the ferritic phase are determined by using the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), never exceeding -150 MPa in compression. Thanks to these measurements, each stress value can be associated with a microscopie observation in order to couple the behavior of the material with the damage at various temperatures.",['spi']

First- and Third-Person Perspectives in Immersive Virtual Environments: Presence and Performance Analysis of Embodied Users,"Current design of virtual reality (VR) applications relies essentially on the transposition of users’ viewpoint in first-person perspective (1PP). Within this context, our research aims to compare the impact and the potentialities enabled via the integration of the third-person perspective (3PP) in immersive virtual environments (IVE). Our empirical study is conducted in order to assess the sense of presence, the sense of embodiment, and performance of users confronted with a series of tasks presenting a case of potential use for the video game industry. Our results do not reveal significant differences concerning the sense of spatial presence with either point of view. Nonetheless, they provide evidence confirming the relevance of using the first-person perspective to induce a sense of embodiment toward a virtual body, especially in terms of self-location and ownership. However, no significant differences were observed concerning the sense of agency. Concerning users’ performance, our results demonstrate that the first-person perspective enables more accurate interactions, while the third-person perspective provides better space awareness",['shs']

Large Neighborhood Search for Periodic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem,"In this paper, we address the Periodic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem, named PEVRP. This problem is motivated by a real-life industrial application and it is defined by a planning horizon of several periods typically ”days”, in which each customer has a set of allowed visit days and must be served once in the time horizon. The whole demand of each customer must be fulfilled all together. A limited fleet of electric vehicles is available at the depot. The EVs could be charged during their trips at the depot and in the available external charging stations. The objective of the PEVRP is to minimize the total cost of routing and charging over the time horizon. We propose a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework for solving the PEVRP. Different implementation schemes of the proposed method including customer and station insertion strategies, three destroy operators and three insertion operators are tested on generalized benchmark instances. The computational results show that LNS prod uces competitive results compared to results obtained in previous studies. An analysis of the performance of the proposed operators is also presented.",['info']
E-BRAILLE DOCUMENTS: NOVEL METHOD FOR ERROR FREE GENERATION,Present manuscript proposes a technique for estimating the angle of rotation for a Braille document image which in turn will be used for aiding its automatic character recognition. The technique is based on maximizing number of null projection of the derived image vector. Results show that any amount of rotation transformed distortion can be nullified and thus leading to proper reading of imprinted Braille character pattern. The proposed methods have been successfully tested on manually written as well as computer generated Braille with rotation distortion.,['info']
Spherical wave reflection in layered media with rough interfaces: Three-dimensional modeling,"In the context of sediment characterization, layer interface roughnesses may be responsible for sound-speed profile measurement uncertainties. To study the roughness influence, a three-dimensional (3D) modeling of a layered seafloor with rough interfaces is necessary. Although roughness scattering has an abundant literature, 3D modeling of spherical wave reflection on rough interfaces is generally limited to a single interface (using Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral) or computationally expensive techniques (finite difference or finite element method). In this work, it is demonstrated that the wave reflection over a layered medium with irregular interfaces can be modeled as a sum of integrals over each interface. The main approximations of the method are the tangent-plane approximation, the Born approximation (multiple reflection between interfaces are neglected) and flat-interface approximation for the transmitted waves into the sediment. The integration over layer interfaces results in a method with reasonable computation cost.",['spi']
Compressed sensing for wideband wavenumber tracking in dispersive shallow water,"In shallow water zones and at low frequency, seabed and water column properties can be estimated from the acoustic wavenumbers using inversion algorithms. When considering horizontal line arrays (HLA) and narrowband sources, the wavenumbers can be evaluated with classic spectral analysis methods. In this paper, a compressed sensing (CS) method for sparse recovery of the wavenumbers is proposed. This takes advantage of the few propagating modes and allows for spectral estimation when short HLA are used. The CS representation improves the wavenumber estimation, compared to the Fourier transform. However, for small arrays and several propagating modes, the CS generates interferences and does not allow proper wavenumber estimation. When considering broadband sources, it is possible to combine the wavenumbers estimated at several frequencies in order to build a frequency-wavenumber (f − k) representation. In this case, a post-processing tracking operation which improves the f − k resolution is presented. This relies on a general approach of waveguide physics and uses a particle filtering (PF) algorithm to track the wavenumbers. The consecutive use of CS and PF leads to a better wavenumber estimation. This methodology can be used for sources that are not at an end-fire position. It is illustrated by simulations and successfully applied on the Shallow Water 2006 data using the 32 sensor SHARK array.",['spi']
Automated detection of Antarctic blue whale calls,"This paper addresses the problem of automated detection of Z-calls emitted by Antarctic blue whales (B. m. intermedia). The proposed solution is based on a subspacedetector of sigmoidal-frequency signals with unknown time-varying amplitude. This detection strategy takes into account frequency variations of blue whale calls as well as the presence of other transient sounds that can interfere with Z-calls (such as airguns or other whale calls). The proposed method has been tested on more than 105 h of acoustic data containing about 2200 Z-calls (as found by an experienced human operator). This method is shown to have a correct-detection rate of up to more than 15% better than the extensible bioacoustic tool package, a spectrogram-based correlation detector commonly used to study blue whales. Because the proposed method relies on subspacedetection, it does not suffer from some drawbacks of correlation-based detectors. In particular, it does not require the choice of an a priori fixed and subjective template. The analytic expression of the detection performance is also derived, which provides crucial information for higher level analyses such as animal density estimation from acoustic data. Finally, the detection threshold automatically adapts to the soundscape in order not to violate a user-specified false alarm rate.",['spi']
Passive acoustic observations of tide height in the Iroise Sea using ambient noise,"Considering a broadband motionless source in a waveguide with a depth that varies with time, the time-frequency representation of the acoustic intensity shows a striation pattern than can be explained using the depth-frequency waveguide invariant. This phenomenon is used here to describe acoustic data recorded in the Iroise Sea, where intense tides occur. The originality of this study is that the acoustic data consist of only ambient noise. The best hypothesis is that these striations are created by distant marine traffic in the Bay of Brest, and the results suggest that tide height can be monitored using long-term passive acoustics.",['spi']
On the variation of interaural time differences with frequency,"Interaural time difference (ITD) is a major cue to sound localization in humans and animals. For a given subject and position in space, ITD depends on frequency. This variation is analyzed here using a head related transfer functions (HRTFs) database collected from the literature and comprising human HRTFs from 130 subjects and animal HRTFs from six specimens of different species. For humans, the ITD is found to vary with frequency in a way that shows consistent differences with respect to a spherical head model. Maximal ITD values were found to be about 800 ls in low frequencies and 600 ls in high frequencies. The ITD variation with frequency (up to 200 ls for some positions) occurs within the frequency range where ITD is used to judge the lateral position of a sound source. In addition, ITD varies substantially within the bandwidth of a single auditory filter, leading to systematic differences between envelope and fine-structure ITDs. Because the frequency-dependent pattern of ITD does not display spherical symmetries, it potentially provides cues to elevation and resolves front/back confusion. The fact that the relation between position and ITDs strongly depends on the sound’s spectrum in turn suggests that humans and animals make use of this relationship for the localization of sounds.",['spi']

The GMO Panel has previously assessed the three single events combined to produce this three-event stack maize and did not identify safety concerns. No new data on the single events, leading to modification of the original conclusions on their safety, were identified. Based on the molecular, agronomic, phenotypic and compositional characteristics, the combination of the single maize events and of the newly expressed proteins in the three-event stack maize did not give rise to issues regarding food and feed safety or nutrition. In the case of accidental release of viable grains of maize MON 87427 9 MON 89034 9 NK603 into the environment, the three-event stack maize would not raise environmental safety concerns.

"Part C notification (reference C/NL/13/01) from Suntory Holdings Limited for the import, distribution and retailing of carnation SHD-27531-4 cut flowers with modified petal colour for ornamental use","The Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA GMO Panel) has evaluated the overall safety of genetically modified (GM) carnation SHD-27531-4 cut flowers to be imported into the European Union (EU) for ornamental use. The genetic modification results in the flowers having purple petals. The stability of the new colour trait was observed over multiple vegetative generations. The purple colour of the petals comes from the altered expression levels of anthocyanins, common pigments found in edible fruits and vegetables. Considering the intended use of the GM carnation and the possible routes of exposure, the EFSA GMO Panel did not find indications that the genetic modification will increase the risk of allergy among those coming into contact with carnations. Overall there are no reasons for safety concerns of carnation SHD-27351-4 for humans. The EFSA GMO Panel also considered whether viable seed or pollen from GM carnation cut flowers could be dispersed into the environment and whether GM carnation can be propagated by rooting. Owing to the limited environmental exposure and the biology of the plant, the EFSA GMO Panel did not identify any environmental safety concerns and agrees with the scope of the post-market environmental monitoring plan.

In this Scientific Opinion, the GMO Panel assessed the three-event stack OSR and subcombinations that have not been authorised previously (i.e. MS8 × GT73 and RF3 × GT73), independently of their origin, for food and feed uses, import and processing, with the exception of isolated seed protein for food. The combination of OSR events, MS8, RF3 and GT73, in the three-event stack OSR does not raise issues relating to molecular, agronomic/phenotypic or compositional characteristics requiring further investigations. In line with previous assessments and considering the scope of this application, the GMO Panel did not find indications of safety concern for food and feed with trace levels of glyphosate oxidoreductase (GOX)v247 protein derived from the three-event stack OSR; whereas, the GMO Panel cannot assess the safety of three-event stack OSR products rich in protein, such as rapeseed protein isolates in feed. As the risk assessment of the three-event stack OSR could not be completed for products rich in protein, such as rapeseed protein isolates, the GMO Panel is not in a position to complete the food and feed safety assessment of subcombinations within the scope of this application (i.e. MS8 × GT73 and RF3 × GT73). The two-event stack OSR MS8 × RF3 is outside the scope of this application. Considering the scope of this application, the mode of action of the introduced traits and the data available for the three-event and two-event stack OSR MS8 × RF3, the GMO Panel considered that different combinations of the events, MS8, RF3 and GT73, would not raise environmental concerns.",['sdv']

In this opinion, the GMO Panel assesses only the three-event stack cotton. No new data on the single events, leading to modification of the original conclusions on their safety, were identified. The combination of cotton events 281-24-236, 3006-210-23 and MON 88913 in the three-event stack cotton did not give rise to issues – based on the molecular, agronomic, phenotypic or compositional characteristics – regarding food and feed safety and nutrition. The combination of the newly expressed proteins in the three-event stack cotton did not raise concerns for human and animal health. Considering the introduced traits and the outcome of the comparative analysis, the routes of exposure and limited exposure levels, the GMO Panel concludes that this three-event stack cotton would not raise safety concerns in case of accidental release of viable cottonseeds into the environment. The post-market environmental monitoring plans provided by the applicant are in line with the scope of the three-event stack cotton. No post-market monitoring of food/feed derived from the three-event stack cotton is considered necessary.

The data received in the context of this renewal application contain post-market environmental monitoring reports, systematic searches and evaluation of literature, updated bioinformatics analyses, and additional documents or studies performed by or on behalf of the applicant. The GMO Panel assessed these data for possible new hazards, modified exposure or new scientific uncertainties identified during the authorisation period and not previously assessed in the context of the original application. Under the assumption that the DNA sequence of the event in oilseed rape MS8, RF3 and MS89RF3 considered for renewed authorisation is identical to the sequence of the originally assessed event, the GMO Panel concludes that there is no evidence in the context of this renewal application for new hazards, modified exposure or scientific uncertainties that would change the conclusions of the original risk assessment on oilseed rape MS8, RF3 and MS89RF3.",['sdv']

No new data on the single events affecting the original conclusions were identified. Based on the molecular, agronomic, phenotypic and compositional characteristics, the combination of soybean events 305423 and 40-3-2 in the two-event stack soybean did not raise concerns regarding food and feed safety or nutrition. The combination of the newly expressed proteins in the two-event stack soybean did not raise human or animal health concerns. No compositional differences requiring further assessment were identified between soybean 305423 × 40-3-2, the non-GM comparator, additional comparators and the non-GM commercial soybean reference varieties, except for the altered fatty acid profile (consistent with the intended trait). Nutritional assessment of food products from soybean 305423 × 40-3-2 identified no concerns for human health and nutrition. There are no concerns regarding the use of feedingstuffs from defatted toasted soybean 305423 × 40-3-2 meal. There are no indications of an increased likelihood of establishment and spread of occasional feral soybean plants, unless these are exposed to acetolactate-synthase-inhibiting or glyphosate-containing herbicides. Risks associated with the unlikely, but theoretically possible, horizontal transfer of recombinant genes from soybean 305423 × 40-3-2 to bacteria were not identified. Considering the scope of the application, interactions with biotic and abiotic environments are not considered a relevant issue. The post-market environmental monitoring plan and reporting intervals are in line with the intended uses of soybean 305423 × 40-3-2. The GMO Panel is of the opinion that soybean 305423 × 40-3-2 is as safe as the non-GM comparator and non-GM commercial soybean varieties with respect to potential effects on human and animal health and environment in the context of its scope.

The EFSA GMO Panel has previously assessed the five single events that are combined to produce this five-event stack maize Bt11 × 59122 × MIR604 × 1507 × GA21 and did not identify safety concerns. No new data on the single events, leading to a modification of the original conclusions on their safety, were identified. The molecular, agronomic, phenotypic and compositional data on the five-event stack maize did not give rise to safety concerns and there is no reason to expect interactions between the single events impacting on the food and feed safety of the five-event stack maize. Considering the scope of the application (no cultivation), routes of exposure and limited exposure levels, the Panel concludes that this five-event stack maize would not raise safety concerns in the event of accidental release of viable grains into the environment. The EFSA GMO Panel concludes that the five-event stack maize is as safe and as nutritious as its conventional counterpart in the context of its scope. For the 20 subcombinations, the EFSA GMO Panel followed a weight-of-evidence approach, and concluded that they are expected to be as safe as the five-event stack maize. No specific data were submitted for the subcombinations included in the scope of this application that could be produced by conventional crossing through targeted breeding approaches. In order to reduce the consequent uncertainties and to confirm assumptions made for their assessment, the EFSA GMO Panel considers that the applicant should provide relevant information, if these subcombinations were to be created via targeted breeding approaches and imported into the EU in the future.

The molecular characterisation of maize DAS-40278-9 did not raise safety issues. The agronomic, phenotypic and compositional characteristics of maize DAS-40278-9 tested under field conditions revealed no differences between maize DAS-40278-9 and its non-genetically modified (GM) comparator that would give rise to food and feed or environmental safety concerns. There were no concerns regarding the potential toxicity and allergenicity of the newly expressed protein AAD-1, and no evidence that the genetic modification might significantly change the overall allergenicity of maize DAS-40278-9. The nutritional characteristics of maize DAS-40278-9 are not expected to differ from those of non-GM maize varieties and no post-market monitoring of food/feed is considered necessary. Maize DAS-40278-9 is as nutritious as its non-GM comparator and other non-GM commercial varieties. There are no indications of an increased likelihood of establishment and spread of occasional feral maize DAS-40278-9 plants, unless these plants are exposed to the intended herbicides. However, this will not result in different environmental impacts compared to conventional maize. Considering the scope of the application, interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment were not considered an issue.

No new data on these single events, leading to a modification of the original conclusions on safety, were identified. The molecular, agronomic, phenotypic and compositional data on soybean MON 87769 × MON 89788 did not give rise to safety concerns. The Panel considers that there is no reason to expect interactions between the single events to impact on food and feed safety. There were no concerns regarding the potential toxicity or allergenicity of soybean MON 87769 × MON 89788, and no evidence that the genetic modification significantly changes the overall allergenicity. Because of the lack of data on dietary exposure to refined bleached deodorised oil from soybean MON 87769 × MON 89788, the EFSA GMO Panel could not complete the human health and nutrition assessment. There are no concerns regarding the use of feedingstuffs derived from defatted toasted MON 87769 × MON 89788 soybean meal. There are no indications of an increased likelihood of establishment and spread of feral soybean plants. Potential interactions of soybean MON 87769 × MON 89788 with biotic and abiotic environments were not considered relevant to this application. The unlikely, but theoretically possible, transfer of recombinant genes from soybean MON 87769 × MON 89788 to environmental bacteria is not of safety concern. The post-market environmental monitoring plan and reporting intervals conform with the scope of this application. In conclusion, the Panel could not complete the food and feed safety assessment of soybean MON 87769 × MON 89788 because of the lack of an appropriate nutritional assessment.

Annual post‐market environmental monitoring (PMEM) report on the cultivation of genetically modified maize MON 810 in 2015 from Monsanto Europe S.A.,"Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (GMO Panel) assessed the annual post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) report for the 2015 growing season of the Cry1Ab-expressing maize event MON 810 provided by Monsanto Europe S.A. The GMO Panel concludes that the insect resistance monitoring data submitted to EFSA do not indicate a decrease in susceptibility of field Iberian populations of corn borers to the Cry1Ab protein during the 2015 season. However, since the methodology for insect resistance monitoring remained unchanged compared to previous PMEM reports, the GMO Panel reiterates its previous recommendations on resistance monitoring to provide sufficient detection sensitivity. Although the farmer alert system to report complaints about product performance could complement the information obtained from the laboratory bioassays, the GMO Panel is currently not in a position to appraise its usefulness, and therefore encourages the consent holder to provide more information on this complementary resistance monitoring tool. The data on general surveillance (GS) do not indicate any unanticipated adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment arising from the cultivation of maize MON 810. The GMO Panel reiterates its previous recommendations on the analysis of farmer questionnaires, and advises the consent holder to provide more detailed information on the conducting and reporting of the literature search in future annual PMEM reports. Moreover, the GMO Panel encourages relevant parties to continue developing a methodological framework to use existing networks in the broader context of environmental monitoring.

"Part C notification (reference C/NL/13/02) from Suntory Holdings Limited for the import, distribution and retailing of carnation FLO-40685-2 cut flowers with modified petal colour for ornamental use","The Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (GMO Panel) has evaluated the overall safety of genetically modified (GM) carnation FLO-40685-2 cut flowers to be imported into the EU for ornamental use. The genetic modification results in the flowers having purple petals. The stability of the newly introduced trait (purple flower colour) was observed over multiple vegetative generations. The purple colour of the petals comes from the altered expression levels of anthocyanins, common pigments found in edible fruits and vegetables. Considering the intended use of the GM carnation and the possible routes of exposure, the GMO Panel did not find indications that the genetic modification will increase the risk of allergy among those coming into contact with carnations. Overall there are no reasons for safety concerns of carnation FLO-40685-2 for humans. The GMO Panel also considered whether viable seed or pollen from GM carnation cut flowers could be dispersed into the environment and whether GM carnation can be propagated by rooting. Owing to the limited environmental exposure and the biology of the plant, the GMO Panel did not identify any environmental safety concerns and agrees with the scope of the post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) plan. The GMO Panel concludes that the import, distribution and retailing of the GM carnation will not cause adverse effects on human health or the environment.",['sdv']

These maize events were found to be as safe as their conventional counterparts and other appropriate comparators with respect to potential effects on human and animal health and the environment. In its assessment of the four-event maize stack Bt11 9 MIR162 9 MIR604 9 GA21, the GMO Panel also assessed all the subcombinations of these events not previously assessed, including some for which little or no experimental data were provided, including the two-stack maize event Bt11 9 MIR162 (application EFSA-GMO-DE-2009-66). On 8 November 2016, the European Commission received from Syngenta information on the subcombination Bt11 9 MIR162. On 14 December 2016, the European Commission tasked EFSA to analyse these data and to indicate whether they have an impact on the previously issued opinion on the four-event stack Bt11 9 MIR162 9 MIR604 9 GA21 and its subcombinations. The GMO Panel used the appropriate principles described in its guidelines for the risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) plants to analyse the provided data. The levels of the newly expressed proteins Cry1Ab, PAT, Vip3Aa20 and PMI are similar between the two-event stack Bt11 9 MIR162 and the corresponding single events Bt11 and MIR162. Based on this analysis, there is no indication of an interaction between the events combined in maize Bt11 9 MIR162 that would affect the levels of the newly expressed proteins. Thus, the GMO Panel considers that the new information for maize Bt11 9 MIR162 does not alter the conclusions of the scientific opinion on application EFSA-GMO-DE-2009-66.",['sdv']

The GMO Panel has previously assessed the single events combined to produce this three-event stack OSR and did not identify safety concerns; no new information that would modify the original conclusions was identified. The combination of the single OSR events and of the newly expressed proteins in the three-event stack OSR does not give rise to food and feed safety and nutrition issues – based on the molecular, agronomic/phenotypic and compositional characteristics. In the case of accidental release of viable OSR MON 88302 × MS8 × RF3 seeds into the environment, the three-event stack OSR would not raise environmental safety concerns. The GMO Panel therefore concluded that the three-event stack OSR is as safe and as nutritious as its conventional counterpart and the tested non-GM reference varieties in the context of the scope of this application. Since no new safety concerns were identified for the previously assessed two-event stack OSR MS8 × RF3, the GMO Panel considered that its previous conclusions on this subcombination remain valid. For the two subcombinations MON 88302 × MS8 and MON 88302 × RF3 for which no experimental data were provided, the GMO Panel assessed the likelihood of interactions among the single events, and concluded that their different combinations would not raise safety concerns. These two subcombinations are therefore expected to be as safe as the single events, the previously assessed OSR MS8 × RF3, and OSR MON 88302 × MS8 × RF3. Since the post-market environmental monitoring plan for the three-event stack OSR does not include any provisions for two subcombinations not previously assessed, the GMO Panel recommended the applicant to revise the plan accordingly.",['sdv']

Toward the protection of bees and pollination: the rise of global change science,"Over the past 30 years (1987-2016), bibliometric data shows a drastic change in the scientific investigation of threats to bee populations. Bee research efforts committed to studying bioagressors of honeybees (mainly Varroa sp.) were predominant, but now appear to be shifting from bioagressors to global change in the published literature. This rise of global change science reveals prevailing topics, for current and future years: climate change, landscape alteration, agricultural intensification and invasive species. We argue that with increased investment in applied research and development, the scientific, beekeeping and agricultural communities will be able to find management strategies for productive agrosystems and enhanced resilience of pollination and beekeeping. This implies the need for restoring and improving food resources and shelter of bees by ecological intensification of diversified farming systems, but also reconciling sustainable beekeeping with wild pollinator conservation.",['sdv']
Generalized interfacial energy and size effects in composites,"The objective of this contribution is to explain the size effect in composites due to the interfacial energy between the constituents of the underlying microstructure. The generalized interface energy accounts for both jumps of the deformation as well as the stress across the interface. The cohesive zone and elastic interface are only two limit cases of the general interface model. A closed form analytical solution is derived to compute the effective interface-enhanced material response. Our novel analytical solution is in excellent agreement with the numerical results obtained from the finite element method for a broad variety of parameters and dimensions. A remarkable observation is that the notion of size effect is theoretically bounded verified by numerical examples. Thus, the gain or loss via reducing the dimensions of the microstructure is limited to certain ultimate values, immediately relevant for designing nano-composites.",['spi']
Experimental study of bubble sweep-down in wave and current circulating tank: Part II—Bubble clouds characterization,"In this second part, images acquired from the specific trials developed in order to study the phenomenon of bubble sweep-down are analysed. A post-processing method has been developed to analyse the two air entrainment mechanisms described in the first part, for several test configurations. Bubble clouds are described in terms of depth, area and velocity for both vortex shedding and breakingwave bubble clouds. A parametric study is also performed to calculate the influence of each test parameter on the frequency of bubble generation. It is demonstrated that the occurrence of bubble clouds is proportional to the wave height, with a considerable influence of the phase shift between waves and motions. The overall results provide new elements for the understanding and the study of the phenomenon, with the final objective of obtaining a reliable tool that facilitates the design of research vessels.",['spi']
Experimental study of bubble sweep-down in wave and current circulating tank: Part I—Experimental set-up and observed phenomena,"Bubble sweep-down is a significant issue for the oceanographic vessels, which affect the acoustic sur- veys. Experimental trials, carried out in the Ifremerwave and current circulating tank on a 1/30 model of the Pourquoi pas?, are presented. The results demonstrate that this kind of experimental facility is well suited to study the phenomenon of bubble sweep-down encountered around the bow of a ship under specific conditions. From these results, two kinds of bubble clouds formation have been observed and analysed: bubble clouds generated by vortex shedding and breaking waves. The vortex shedding bubble clouds appear randomly in all the configurations tested, even without waves or motions. This phe- nomenon is due to the interaction between the turbulent flow and the specific bow shape of the Pourquoi pas?. On the other hand, the breaking wave clouds appear in the presence of relative motions between the free surface and the bow ship and more significantly under wave sollicitations. A complementary paper presents a parametric study carried out to quantify the influence of the test conditions.",['spi']
"TWO GENERATIONS OF MUSLIM WOMEN IN FRANCE : CREATIVE PARENTING, IDENTITY AND RECOGNITION","In France today there are approximately one million families who come from North Africa. Many of these are large families. Their children are born in France and they are French citizens. Their language is French, and they are raised in French schools. They feel French. But given the colonial past of France, the metropolitan French continue to consider them somehow as 'the other'. This post-colonial attitude has very damaging consequences, encouraging discrimination by some teachers, by employers, by landlords and by the police. 1 Their parents and especially their mothers are fully aware of what their children will have to face. Mothers in particular are concerned to prepare their children to encounter the risks of discriminatory situations. I myself have been reconstructing in-depth case studies of Muslim immigrant families in France for many years. For the last twenty years I have focused in particular on how these working class families originating from the Maghreb – the mountainous rural interior of Algeria and Morocco – educate their children to face the difficulties linked to economic instability: unemployment, chronic shortage of money, and discrimination.",['shs']
Full-scale flying shape measurement of offwind yacht sails with photogrammetry,"Yacht downwind sails are complex to study due to their non-developable shape with high camber and massively detached flow around thin and flexible membranes. Numerical simulations can now simulate this strong fluid-structure interaction, but need experimental validation. It remains complex to measure spinnaker flying shapes partly because of their inherent instability, like luff flapping. This work presents full-scale experimental investigation of spinnaker shapes with simultaneous measurement of aerodynamic loads on the three sail corners, with navigation and wind data. The experimental set-up and photogrammetric method are presented. Results are analysed in the whole range of apparent wind angle for this sail. The spinnaker shape shows dramatic variations and high discrepancies with the design shape. The photogrammetric measurement produces the full 3D flying shape with a satisfactory accuracy. Even if only steady state results are given here, this new system enables time-resolved measurement of flying shapes and thus flapping of spinnakers to be investigated, which is valuable for yacht performance optimisation. On top of sailing yacht applications, the method is useful in any application where a non-developable 3D shape is to be determined, and particularly when it results from the Fluid Structure Interaction of a flexible structure with a complex flow.","['spi', 'phys']"
Effective behavior of thermo-elastic tubes with wavy layers,"In the present article, the homogenization of a composite star-shaped tube with numerous thin, periodic, elastic wavy layers, is presented. The composite exhibits a multiscale periodicity allowing for a multistep asymptotic homogenization scheme starting from the finest scale. The scheme gives the complete effective thermoelastic behavior of the composite. By a numerical example of a two-phase composite with sinusoidal wavy walls, whose effective behavior is an orthotropic material, the above method is illustrated.",['spi']
Microscopic modelling of orientation kinematics of non-spherical particles suspended in confined flows using unilateral mechanics,"The properties of reinforced polymers strongly depend on the microstructural state, that is, the orientation state of the fibres suspended in the polymeric matrix, induced by the forming process. Understanding flow-induced anisotropy is thus a key element to optimize both materials and process. Despite the important progresses accomplished in the modelling and simulation of suspensions, few works addressed the fact that usual processing flows evolve in confined configurations, where particles characteristic lengths may be greater than the thickness of the narrow gaps in which the flow takes place. In those circumstances, orientation kinematics models proposed for unconfined flows must be extended to the confined case. In this short communication, we propose an alternative modelling framework based on the use of unilateral mechanics, consequently exhibiting a clear analogy with plasticity and contact mechanics. This framework allows us to revisit the motion of confined particles in Newtonian and non-Newtonian matrices. We also prove that the confined kinematics provided by this model are identical to those derived from microstructural approaches",['spi']
Wavelet-based multiscale proper generalized decomposition,"Separated representations at the heart of Proper Generalized Decomposition are constructed incrementally by minimizing the problem residual. However, the modes involved in the resulting decomposition do not exhibit a clear multi-scale character. In order to recover a multi-scale description of the solution within a separated representation framework, we study the use of wavelets for approximating the functions involved in the separated representation of the solution. We will prove that such an approach allows separating the different scales as well as taking profit from its multi-resolution behavior for defining adaptive strategies.",['spi']
On the physical interpretation of fractional diffusion,"Even if the diffusion equation has been widely used in physics and engineering, and its physical content is well understood, some variants of it escape fully physical understanding. In particular, anormal diffusion appears in the so-called fractional diffusion equation, whose main particularity is its non-local behavior, whose physical interpretation represents the main part of the present work.",['spi']
Advanced parametric space-frequency separated representations in structural dynamics: A harmonic–modal hybrid approach,"This paper is concerned with the solution to structural dynamics equations. The technique here presented is closely related to Harmonic Analysis, and therefore it is only concerned with the long-term forced response. Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) is used to compute space-frequency separated representations by considering the frequency as an extra coordinate. This formulation constitutes an alternative to classical methods such as Modal Analysis and it is especially advantageous when parametrized structural dynamics equations are of interest. In such case, there is no need to solve the parametrized eigenvalue problem and the space-time solution can be recovered with a Fourier inverse transform. The PGD solution is valid for any forcing term that can be written as a combination of the considered frequencies. Finally, the solution is available for any value of the parameter. When the problem involves frequency-dependent parameters the proposed technique provides a specially suitable method that becomes computationally more efficient when it is combined with a modal representation.",['spi']
An incremental–iterative method for modeling damage evolution in voxel-based microstructure models,"Numerical methods motivated by rapid advances in image processing techniques have been intensively developed during recent years and increasingly applied to simulate heterogeneous materials with complex microstructure. The present work aims at elaborating an incremental–iterative numerical method for voxel-based modeling of damage evolution in quasi-brittle microstructures. The iterative scheme based on the Lippmann–Schwinger equation in the real space domain (Yvonnet, in Int J Numer Methods Eng 92:178–205, 2012) is first cast into an incremental form so as to implement nonlinear material models efficiently. In the proposed scheme, local strain increments at material grid points are computed iteratively by a mapping operation through a transformation array, while local stresses are determined using a constitutive model that accounts for material degradation by damage. For validation, benchmark studies and numerical simulations using microtomographic data of concrete are performed. For each test, numerical predictions by the incremental–iterative scheme and the finite element method, respectively, are presented and compared for both global responses and local damage distributions. It is emphasized that the proposed incremental–iterative formulation can be straightforwardly applied in the framework of other Lippmann–Schwinger equation-based schemes, like the fast Fourier transform method.",['spi']
Generation of controlled delaminations in composites using symmetrical laser shock configuration,"Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is defined as the process of implementing a damage identification strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructures. SHM can be organized into five main steps: detection, localization, classification, quantification and prognosis. Our work considers SHM quantification level and in particular the evaluation of the severity of delamination-type damage in CFRP composite laminates. Prior to quantification algorithms implementation, it is important to properly prepare the supports on which algorithms will be tested. Teflon inserts and conventional impacts are commonly used techniques to generate or simulate delaminations. However, with such rudimentary techniques it is difficult to generate controlled delamination-type damage in a realistic way. In the present work, we investigate symmetrical laser shock approach, as a new method to calibrate delaminations in composites. By tuning the time delay between the two laser beams and laser energy, through-thickness damage position and severity can respectively be adjusted. The effect of multiple contiguous laser impacts was also investigated. Post-mortem analyses using A-scan and C-scan testing as well as penetrant testing were performed in order to characterize laser impact induced damage. Results are encouraging and demonstrate the high potential of symmetrical laser shock for damage calibration in both size and location.",['spi']
"Three-dimensional FE2 method for the simulation of non-linear, rate-dependent response of composite structures","In this paper, a two scale Finite Element method (FE2 ), is presented to predict the non-linear macroscopic response of 3D composite structures with periodic microstructure that exhibit a time-dependent response. The sensitivity to the strain rate requires an homogenization scheme to bridge the scales between the macroscopic boundary conditions applied and the local evaluation of the strain rate. In the present work, the effective response of composite materials where the matrix has a local elasto-viscoplastic behavior with ductile damage are analyzed using periodic homogenization, solving simultaneously finite element problems at the microscopic scale (unit cell) and at the macroscopic scale. This approach can integrate any kind of periodic microstructure with any type of non-linear behavior for the constituents (without the consideration of non-linear geometric effects), allowing to treat complex mechanisms that can occur in every phase and at their interface. The numerical implementation of this simulation strategy has been performed with a parallel computational technique in ABAQUS/Standard,with the implementation of a set of dedicated scripts. The homogenization process is performed using a user-defined constitutive law that solve a set full-field non-linear simulations of a Unit Cell and perform the necessary homogenization of the mechanical quantities. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with three examples of 3D composite structures with plastic or viscoplastic and ductile damage matrix. In the first example, the numerical results obtained by this full field approach are compared with a semi-analytical solution on elastoplastic multilayer composite structure. The second example investigates the macroscopic response of a complex viscoplastic composite structure with ductile damage and is compared with the mean field Mori-Tanaka method. Finally, 3D corner structure consisting of periodically aligned short fibres composite is analysed under complex loading path. These numerical simulations illustrate the capabilities of the FE2 strategy under non-linear regime, when time dependent constitutive models describe the response of the constituents",['spi']
Hybrid micromechanical-phenomenological modelling of anisotropic damage and anelasticity induced by micro-cracks in unidirectional composites,"In this paper, a new modelling approach is presented to describe the damaged mechanical response of unidirectional composites under the small strain assumption. The proposed constitutive equations inherits from the phenomenological theories of Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) but brings out a micromechanical description of the damaged Representative Volume Element (RVE) while being formulated in a proper thermodynamical framework. The model is provided with an implicit numerical scheme based on the so-called ”return mapping algorithm” as well as the formulation of the tangent operator. The identification and the prediction capabilities of the model are validated using experimental data including off-axis tensile tests. Finally, to provide a better understanding of the model, a multi-axial non-proportional simulation is performed and analysed.",['spi']
Comments on the mixture detection rule used in SPC control charts,"When calculating independently the false alarm rate of the eight usual runs rules used in SPC control chart, it appears that the proposed rule designed to detect mixture patterns corresponds to a Type-I error strongly lower than the seven other rules. This discrepancy is underlined and the mixture rule is showed to be useless both for in-control and out-of-control processes. Thus a modification of the mixture detection rule is proposed and the impact of this new mixture rule is then illustrated and discussed using Monte Carlo calculations.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
Numerical study of laser ablation on aluminum for shock-wave applications: development of a suitable model by comparison with recent experiments,"In order to control laser-induced shock processes, two main points of interest must be fully understood: the laser–matter interaction generating a pressure loading from a given laser intensity profile and the propagation of induced shock waves within the target. This work aims to build a predictive model for laser shock-wave experiments with two grades of aluminum at low to middle intensities (50 to 500 GW/cm 2 500 GW/cm2 ) using the hydrodynamic Esther code. This one-dimensional Lagrangian code manages both laser–matter interaction and shocks propagation. The numerical results are compared to recent experiments conducted on the transportable laser shocks generator facility. The results of this work motivate a discussion on the shock behavior dependence to elastoplasticity and fracturation models. Numerical results of the rear surface velocity show a good agreement with the experimental results, and it appears that the response of the material to the propagating shock is well predicted. The Esther code associated to this developed model can therefore be considered as a reliable predictive code for laser ablation and shock-wave experiments with pure aluminum and 6061 aluminum in the mentioned range of parameters. The pressure–intensity relationship generated by the Esther code is compared to previously established relationships.",['spi']
Bayesian source localization with uncertain Green’s function in an uncertain shallow water oceana,"Matched-field acoustic source localization is a challenging task when environmental properties of the oceanic waveguide are not precisely known. Errors in the assumed environment (mismatch) can cause severe degradations in localization performance. This paper develops a Bayesian approach to improve robustness to environmental mismatch by considering the waveguide Green’s function to be an uncertain random vector whose probability density accounts for environmental uncertainty. The posterior probability density is integrated over the Green’s function probability density to obtain a joint marginal probability distribution for source range and depth, accounting for environmental uncertainty and quantifying localization uncertainty. Because brute-force integration in high dimensions can be costly, an efficient method is developed in which the multi-dimensional Green’s function integration is approximated by one-dimensional integration over a suitably defined correlation measure. An approach to approximate the Green’s function covariance matrix, which represents the environmental mismatch, is developed based on modal analysis. Examples are presented to illustrate the method and Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out to evaluate its performance relative to other methods. The proposed method gives efficient, reliable source localization and uncertainties with improved robustness toward environmental mismatch",['spi']
FMEA and consideration of real work situations for safer design of production systems,"Production equipment designers must ensure the health and safety of future users; in this regard, they augment requirements for standardising and controlling operator work. This contrasts with the ergonomic view of the activity, which recommends leaving operators leeway (margins for manoeuvre) in performing their task, while safeguarding their health. Following a brief analysis of design practices in the car industry, we detail how the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) approach is implemented in this sector. We then suggest an adaptation that enables designers to consider real work situations. This new protocol, namely work situation FMEA, allows experience feedback to be used to defend the health standpoint during designer project reviews, which usually only address quality and performance issues. We subsequently illustrate the advantage of this approach using two examples of work situations at car parts manufacturers: the first from the literature and the second from an in-company industrial project we followed.",['spi']

FEM Simulation of Tool Wear in Drilling,"The objective of this study is to simulate tool wear in drilling of nickel-based alloys, in particular Inconel 718. When machining these kind of materials, the impact of the thermal and mechanical phenomena generated by tool wear on the surface integrity is of prime concern. For this reason, it important to study the influence of tool wear on tool life, on final part quality and on cutting force and power consumption. Tool wear is caused by several phenomena (adhesion, abrasion, erosion, diffusion, corrosion, fracture etc.) depending on selected cutting parameters (cutting velocity, feed rate, etc.). In some cases these wear mechanisms can be described by analytical models which are function of physical quantities involved in process (temperature, pressure and sliding velocity along the cutting surface). Usually, commercial FEM software allows to implement these tool wear models but without tool geometry update. To overcoming this limitation, a suitable subroutine considering tool geometry update was developed and implemented in SFTC DEFORM-3D FEA software to simulate tool wear in drilling of Inconel 718. A good agreement was obtained between the predicted and measured tool wear data.",['spi']
A comparative study between NURBS surfaces and voxels to simulate the wear phenomenon in micro-EDM,"The prediction of the tool wear phenomenon in the micro electro discharge machining technology would be of a great use in the optimization of tool shapes. In order to do so, the ability to rapidly and precisely simulate the process is required. The choice of a geometrical model for the electrodes is of the utmost importance as it will condition the available methods for the simulation.Two geometrical models have been tested and implemented: NURBS and voxels embedded in an octree data structure. A limited experimental validation has been conducted and the results compared to the simulation through the use of the Hausdorff metric.","['info', 'spi']"
Optimization of a dynamic intervertebral lumbar implant,"For the surgical treatment of lumbar pathologies, there are essentially two medical devices that are implanted. Spinal fusion by means of a screwed plate generates a loss of intervertebral mobility, whereas a spinal dynamic implant (SPD) allows relative displacements and thus preserves the adjacent segments and discs. The main goal of this study is to structure the design and to optimize such SPDs. An analytic model based on geometrical and mechanical relations is set up. The characteristics derive from data taken from bibliographical studies. Optimization of the implant characteristics is carried out (materials used, component stiffness, orientation associated with bone tissue degeneration, etc.). To do this, the optimization problem is structured to combine design variables, the mechanical behavior of the medical device (MD) and functional requirements into a single design model allowing the optimization of the MD behavior through a global index.",['spi']
Semantic Evaluation and Deformation of Curves Based on Aesthetic Criteria,"To better simulate the way designers work, specific tools are needed to handle directly specific shape features meaningful for the design intent, without focusing on the underlying mathematic representation. For this purpose it is fundamental to identify proper higher-level shape descriptors as well as the corresponding manipulation techniques. The paper presents the definition and implementation of semantic operators for curve deformation based on a shape characterization that is specific to the industrial design context. The work grounds on the innovative approach suggested by the FIORES-II project for the intent-driven modeling tools for direct shape modification and on the multi-layered architecture proposed by the Network of Excellence AIM@SHAPE for the definition of semantic-oriented 3D models. In particular the paper proposes the use of meaningful aesthetic features for the evaluation of planar curve signature and for their intent-driven direct modification.","['info', 'spi']"
Thermal finite-difference modeling of machining operations in polymers,Polymer materials are known to be easily damaged by temperature reached during machining operations. A two-dimensional finite-difference model is established to predict the temperature in orthogonal cutting. Calculations are validated with experiments carried out on polyurethane samples with various cutting speeds and depths of cut. The cutting temperatures are measured by thermocouples embedded within the workpiece and the tool cutting edge. The model provides a three dimensional thermal field of the workpiece with an accuracy of 20 K.,['spi']
Automatic extraction of assembly component relationships for assembly model retrieval,"Even if during the Product Design Process, assembly models are described in terms of their constitutive components and associated relationships, only the position of each component is often stored within the Digital Mock-Up. Thus, the mating information are lost. However, these relationships are crucial for many applications, such as retrieval, assembly planning and finite element simulations. In this paper, we propose a method for the detection and use of the mating relationships for assembly model retrieval. The proposed approach detects and analyses the interferences between parts to compute their degree of freedom and kinematic pairs. To support the retrieval of assembly models, the extracted information are formalized and capitalized in a newly proposed hierarchical assembly model descriptor. Results of the application of the method are also provided to show the system capabilities. Moreover, considering that a same joint can be defined in multiple ways, this work provides also a method for retrieving assemblies in a dataset according to the part relationships and their class of equivalence.","['info', 'spi']"
Tribological Behavior of PVD Hard Coated Cutting Tools under Cryogenic Cooling Conditions,"Cryogenic assistance is used to improve machining performance and to enhance tool life under extreme contact conditions (pressure and temperature). This paper focuses on the influence of cryogenic cooling conditions using liquid nitrogen within the context of machining Ti6Al4 V with CrN-coated carbide cutting tools. Friction behavior of both CrN-coated and uncoated pins with and without cryogenic cooling were evaluated using a home-made laboratory tribometer.

Finally, the contribution of the CrN coatings was evaluated under both cryogenic cooling and dry conditions.",['spi']
A New Methodology for Evaluation of Mechanical Properties of Materials at Very High Rates of Loading,"This paper focuses on the development of a straight forward and inexpensive testing machine, and methodology for the characterization of materials in working conditions similar to those found in metal cutting. Special emphasis is given to the material rate dependence and to the assessing of the proposed methodology against conventional testing at very high rates of loading. The experimental results have demonstrated that rate-dependent hardness can be used to estimate flow stress at high rates of loading and that contact phenomena become even more prominent for severe monotonic deformation.",['spi']
Life Cycle Assessment of Aluminium Recycling Process: Case of Shredder Cables,"Life cycle impact of European generic primary and secondary aluminium are well defined.

Implementing self-* autonomic properties in self-coordinated manufacturing processes for the Industry 4.0 contextMise en œuvre de propriétés autonomes dans des processus de fabrication auto-coordonnés pour l'industrie 4.0,"Industry 4.0 requires high levels of autonomy in order to guarantee the manufacturing processes to achieve production goals. For this, it is needed high levels of coordination, cooperation, and collaboration, such that the manufacturing process’ actors can communicate and interoperate. A previous paper proposed three autonomic cycles of data analytics tasks for self-coordination in manufacturing processes. In this paper, we implement one of these autonomic cycles, allowing self-supervising of the coordination process. This autonomic cycle is designed using the MIDANO’s methodology, and implemented and tested using an experimental tool that was developed to replay the production process event logs, in order to detect failures and invoke the autonomic cycle for self-healing when needed.",['info']

Age-related neural correlates of facial trustworthiness detection during economic interaction,"Some economic transactions require people to trust strangers, whose trustworthiness is unknown. In these circumstances, behavioral studies have shown that adults (but not young adolescents) seem to have some minimal ability to detect the trustworthiness of adult strangers based on their facial features. In this study, we explored the neural correlates of this facial trustworthiness detection. A group of adolescents and adults played a series of economic Trust Games with adult trustees of which we had previously recorded the strategy. Results showed that when adult investors were looking at the picture of a trust-abusing trustee, the left amygdala was relatively more activated than when they were looking at a trust-honoring player. Younger adolescents did not show this pattern and responded with a more pronounced deactivation when facing a trust-abusing trustee. An exploratory whole-brain analysis detected a similar age shift for mentalizing regions of the brain. Our results fit with an emerging model suggesting that the amygdala is implicated in an associative learning process that progressively refines a mapping of faces onto trustworthy behavior and may result in avoiding to be exploited by untrustworthy strangers.",['shs']

Ontology-based services and knowledge management in the Agronomic Domain,"The drastic growth in data in the recent years, within the Agronomic sciences has brought the concept of knowledge management to the forefront. Some of the factors that contribute to this change include a) conducting high-throughput experiments have become affordable, the time spent in generating data through these experiments are minuscule when compared to its integration and analysis; b) publishing data over the web is fairly trivial and c) multiple databases exist for each type of data (i.e. ‘omics’ data) with a possible overlap or slight variation in its coverage. In most cases these sources remain autonomous and disconnected. Hence, efficiently managed data and the underlying knowledge in principle will make data analysis straightforward aiding in more efficient decision making. At the Institute of Computational Biology (IBC), we are involved in developing methods to aid data integration and knowledge management within the domain of Agronomic sciences to improve information accessibility and interoperability. To this end, we address the challenge by pursuing several complementary research directions towards: distributed, heterogeneous data integration. This talk will focus mainly on, ongoing projects at IBC: a) The AgroPortal project aims at developing a reference ontology repository for the agronomic domain. By reusing the NCBO BioPortal technology, we will offer an ontology portal which features ontology hosting, search, versioning, visualization, comment, but we will also offer services for semantically annotating data with the ontologies, as well as storing and exploiting ontology alignments and data annotations. b) Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD): is a Semantic Web knowledge base designed to integrate data from various publically available plant centric data sources. These include Gramene, Oryzabase, TAIR and resources from the South Green platform among many others. The aim of AgroLD project is to provide a portal for bioinformaticians and domain experts to exploit the homogenized data towards enabling to bridge the knowledge.",['info']

Estimating the parameters of a generalized lambda distribution,"The method of moments is a popular technique for estimating the parameters of a generalized lambda distribution (GLD), but published results suggest that the percentile method gives superior results. However, the percentile method cannot be implemented in an automatic fashion, and automatic methods, like the starship method, can lead to prohibitive execution time with large sample sizes. A new estimation method is proposed that is automatic (it does not require the use of special tables or graphs), and it reduces the computational time. Based partly on the usual percentile method, this new method also requires choosing which quantile u to use when fitting a GLD to data. The choice for u is studied and it is found that the best choice depends on the final goal of the modeling process. The sampling distribution of the new estimator is studied and compared to the sampling distribution of estimators that have been proposed. Naturally, all estimators are biased and here it is found that the bias becomes negligible with sample sizes n⩾2×103. The .025 and .975 quantiles of the sampling distribution are investigated, and the difference between these quantiles is found to decrease proportionally to View the MathML source. The same results hold for the moment and percentile estimates. Finally, the influence of the sample size is studied when a normal distribution is modeled by a GLD. Both bounded and unbounded GLDs are used and the bounded GLD turns out to be the most accurate. Indeed it is shown that, up to n=106, bounded GLD modeling cannot be rejected by usual goodness-of-fit tests.",['math']
Automatic measurement of wood fiber orientation and knot detection using an optical system based on heating conduction,"In this paper, a new approach to computing the deviation of wood grain is proposed. To do this, the thermal conduction properties of timber are used (higher conduction in the fiber direction). Exciting the surface of the wood with a laser and capturing the thermal conduction using a thermal camera, an ellipse can be observed. Using a method similar to the tracheid effect, it is possible to extract information from this ellipse, such as the slope of grain and the presence of knots. With this method it is therefore possible to extend the mechanical model (assessing the mechanical properties of timber) to take certain singularities into account. Using this approach, the slope of grain can be estimated for any wood species, either hardwood or softwood, which was not possible with the existing tracheid effect.",['spi']
Sharp Transition in the Lift Force of a Fluid Flowing Past Nonsymmetrical Obstacles: Evidence for a Lift Crisis in the Drag Crisis Regime,"Bluff bodies moving in a fluid experience a drag force which usually increases with velocity. However in a particular velocity range a drag crisis is observed, i.e., a sharp and strong decrease of the drag force. This counterintuitive result is well characterized for a sphere or a cylinder. Here we show that, for an object breaking the up-down symmetry, a lift crisis is observed simultaneously to the drag crisis. The term lift crisis refers to the fact that at constant incidence the time-averaged transverse force, which remains small or even negative at low velocity, transitions abruptly to large positive values above a critical flow velocity. This transition is characterized from direct force measurements as well as from change in the velocity field around the obstacle.","['spi', 'phys']"
Wide bandgap iridium complexes varying by their ancillary ligands: influence on their electroluminescence properties,"Three heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes comprising 1-methyl-3-propyl-5-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole (tfpt) as the cyclometalated ligand and varying by their ancillary ligands were examined as triplet emitters for Phosphorescent OLEDs. Interestingly, major differences in device performances were obtained with these three isostructural complexes comprising dibenzoylmethane (dbm), acetylacetone (acac) or pyridine-2-carboxylic acid (pic) as the ancillary ligands. Best OLEDs were fabricated with the dibenzoylmethane-based iridium(III) complex. On the opposite, the picolinate and the acetylacetonate-based complexes gave moderate performances. To complement this work, theoretical calculations were carried out on the three complexes. The newly synthesized complex i.e., Ir(tfpt)(pic) was also characterized by UV–vis absorption and luminescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry",['chim']
So-called Spontaneous Human Combustion.,"A well-documented case of so-called Spontaneous Human Combustion is reported. Review of the literature shows that these strange observations have been reported since the 17th century, even in famous novels. There are several main features that may lead to help the diagnosis: the vicinity of the body is intact or nearly intact, some parts of the body are turned into ashes (usually the middle third of the body), whereas other parts are intact or nearly intact, burning of the body usually occurs postmortem, the cause of death is usually natural, there is often (but not always) high concentrations of blood alcohol, there is a source of heat near the body. It is indispensable to rule out a homicide by the examination of the body in situ, the autopsy, the toxicological and histopathological samples, the arson assessment, and a thorough police inquiry.",['shs']
Wave/particle complementarity using single-photon (quantum) delayed-choice experiments,"Bohr's complementarity notion is at the heart of quantum physics. It suggests that quantum systems are observed as waves or particles depending on the type of measurement, i.e., the experimental arrangement, they are subjected to. For instance, sending single photons to an open or closed Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) leads to the observation of particle or wave behaviours, respectively. In 1984, Wheeler proposed a ""Gedanken"" delayed-choice experiment in which the interferometer configuration is chosen at will by the experimentalist only after the photon has already passed the input beam-splitter (BS_in) of the device. This experiment was realized using a single photon source and showed that Bohr's complementarity notion was still obeyed. It was recently proposed to take Wheeler's experiment one step further by employing an output ""quantum beam-splitter"" (QBS), i.e., preparing BS_out in a coherent superposition of being absent and present. This allows choosing the type of measurement, i.e., wave or particle, only after having determined the state of the QBS, which can be (in principle) infinitely delayed. We realized such an experiment by exploiting the resource of entanglement, in this case pairs of polarization entangled photons. The behaviour of one of the paired photons, called the test photon, is analysed using a MZI having a QBS at its output. This QBS is enabled by entanglement and made of a polarization dependent beam-splitter. The other photon, called the corroborative photon, allows determining the state of the QBS, and consequently, which test photon behaviour (wave, particle, or both) is observed. By manipulating the corroborative photon polarization state, we demonstrate a continuous morphing of the test photon from wave to particle behaviour. This refutes simple models of single photons behaving exclusively as waves or particles. The state of the QBS is determined via the measurement of the corroborative photon only after the test photon has already been detected. The space-like separation between the two measurements invalidates local-hidden variable models associated with pre-existing information about the measurement outcomes. In other words, when the test photon is detected, no information is available about the type of measurement it underwent. These results still perfectly obey Bohr's complementarity notion and its extension.",['phys']
How to investigate books like you've never read them before,"You've now understood it : As in real life, you can't trust anyone within fiction-and, above all, you can't trust any narrator. The cases my honorable colleague just explained here are far from being isolated. To show you that writers from Perfidious Albion are not the only ones who, deliberately or accidentally, hide the truth, let's take an example closer to you, geographically and historically speaking : Top of the Lake, Jane Campion's latest TV series. This police thriller was produced on Australian, English and American budget, and the second season, released on 2017, takes place here in Sydney. I want to talk to you about the 2013 case, main plot of the First season of the show. We follow the investigations led by detective Robin Griffin, a police inspector recently returned from Sydney, in Laketop, her home town, small city lost in New Zealand mountains. A pregnant twelve-year-old girl, Tui Mitcham, is found half-drowned in the lake, and then, gone missing. I won't get into details because I don't wan't to spoil completely the pleasure for those who haven't watched it yet, but I would like to point out how obviously unsatisfying the solution seems. One of the main avenues of the investigation is discovering who's the father of Tui's unborn child, presumably the result of rape. Suspicion quickly falls on Tui's father, Matt, a local mafia godfather who runs the area with expeditious and violent methods. In the final episode, Al Parker, detective sergeant of the city, declares that « a doublecrossed DNA test » confirmed that Matt is indeed the father of the baby Tui had just given birth to. Can we really believe that ? There's no doubt that Matt's character has everything to be the ideal culprit-both from an internal and an external perspective. In the eyes of the local community, he's a well-known offender ; in addition, even if the matter is never directly adressed in the dialogues,",['shs']
Iron-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) as Photocatalysts for Radical and Cationic Polymerizations under Near UV and Visible LEDs (385–405 nm),"Photoinitiating systems consisting of a highly porous iron(III)-based metal-organic framework (MOF), an iodonium salt, and N-vinylcarbazole are developed to initiate the free radical promoted cationic polymerization of epoxides under air and the free radical polymerization of acrylates in laminate upon exposure to near UV (385 nm) or visible (405 nm) light-emitting diodes. These systems present a satisfactory initiating ability. Among the five tested iron carboxylate MOFs exhibiting different compositions and topologies, the flexible microporous iron(III) terephthalate MIL53 is particularly interesting, leading to a final conversion of 58% for the ring-opening polymerization of epoxides. This provides the possibility of designing MOF/polymer composite materials with enhanced mechanical properties through the in situ incorporation of the MOF structure during the photopolymerization process.",['chim']
Iodonium-polyoxometalate and thianthrenium-polyoxometalate as new one-component UV photoinitiators for radical and cationic polymerization,"Four novel onium salts (onium-polyoxometalate) have been synthesized and characterized. They contain a diphenyliodonium or a thianthrenium (TH) moiety and a polyoxomolybdate or a polyoxotungstate as new counter anions. Outstandingly, these counter anions are photochemically active and can sensitize the decomposition of the iodonium or TH moiety through an intramolecular electron transfer. The phenyl radicals generated upon UV light irradiation (Xe–Hg lamp) are very efficient to initiate the radical polymerization of acrylates. Cations are also generated for the cationic polymerization of epoxides. Remarkably, these novel iodonium and TH salts are characterized by a higher reactivity compared with that of the diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate and the commercial TH salt, respectively. Interpenetrating polymer networks can also be obtained under air through a concomitant cationic/radical photopolymerization of an epoxy/acrylate blend (monomer conversions > 65%). The photochemical mechanisms are studied by steady-state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, and electron spin resonance techniques.",['chim']
Who archives who on HAL-SHS ?,"Filling the open archives remains the most pressing social engineering issue in scholarly communication. The poster shows the ""who archives who"" graph of a moderately large archive: HAL-SHS, an institutional national open archive focused on humanities and social sciences in France. In this graph, each dot is a person and each arrow shows which contributor archived which author, persons from the same lab having the same colour. This allows to see the various ways in which authors get their documents open-archived. Statistical analysis of the social network complemented with face-to-face ethnographic fieldwork, enables to define a few user archetypes: Agent, Power archiver, Solo, Contributed and Tester. We conclude that: 1/ Self archiving is about as important as proxy archiving. 2/ Contamination from user to user is almost nil (the graph is disconnected, lots of isolates, short paths, low reciprocity). 3/ Diffusion relies mostly on intradisciplinary personal affinity networks rather than institutional academic incitations or lab strategies.","['info', 'math', 'shs']"

Collusion between two-sided platforms,"We study the price and welfare effects of collusion between two-sided platforms and show that they depend on whether collusion occurs on both sides or a single side of the market, and whether users single-home or multi-home. Our most striking result is that one-sided collusion leads to lower (resp. higher) prices on the collusive (resp. competitive) side if the cross-group externalities exerted on the collusive side are positive and sufficiently strong. One-sided collusion may, therefore, benefit the users on the collusive side and harm the users on the competitive side. Our findings have implications regarding cartel detection and damages actions.",['shs']
Globalization Impact on Education in Egypt,"The Education affair in Egypt is a Janus-faced case considered both as ‘local’ and ‘global’. There are local factors specific to this country - the Islamization of the Egyptian society’s moeurs - as well as elements of global and international nature, that insert the Egyptian education case in the larger analytical framework of Globalization. After highlighting how Egypt got involved in the global system by the application of new economic and neoliberal policies, the paper will focus on the dilemma of the Education affair, on islamized attitudes of the educational staff and on new educational policies aimed at contrasting with the rise of Islamization of all public education system. By this, two opposing forces are being in action in Egypt today: on the one hand, a ‘local’ inner force which pushes a part of society toward a radicalization of religious references and on the other hand, a ‘global’ international force which supports the Egyptian government to enforce laws, projects, programmes enabling to guarantee an apparent and precarious balance in the country.",['shs']

An innovative method based on grain angle measurement to sort veneer and predict mechanical properties of beech laminated veneer lumber,This study proposes an innovative model based on local grain angle measurements to predict the modulus of elasticity of LVL made from beech. It includes a veneers sorting method industrially compatible thanks to its low computational time. For this study 41 LVL panels were prepared from 123 beech sheets of veneers. Local grain angle was obtained with a two dimensional scanner and veneer density was measured. Several models based on these measurements have been developed and their ability to predict the modulus of elasticity of LVL panels have been compared. The model based only on local grain angle measurements have been proven more efficient than models taking into account the veneer density. The proposed method can be used to sort veneer during the peeling process and grade the production of LVL panels to optimize their mechanical properties even for low-quality veneer.,['spi']
On functional signatures of bare and coated formwork skin surfaces,"The sticking of the concrete on metallic formworks during building construction generates many concrete wall defects. Several solutions have been proposed, among which surface lubrication and polymeric coatings are commonly applied. In this paper, the main functional signatures of a steel formwork skin and a polymeric coating were determined to understand their effect on the concrete sticking. The topographical, chemical and mechanical signatures of the surfaces were characterized at near-surface regions. The top of the steel formwork a 10 mm-thick layer is constituted of two oxides each one having specific tribological properties. Adding the polymeric coating on the formwork skin surface lowers its surface tension, which lowers the sticking by reducing the wettability. Moreover, the smaller roughness of the coating limits the susceptibility of mechanical anchoring. Nevertheless, scratch testing suggests a short durability of the polymeric coating due to its weak resistance to abrasion",['spi']
Multi-phase-field modeling of anisotropic crack propagation for polycrystalline materials,"A new multi-phase-field method is developed for modeling the fracture of polycrystals at the mi-crostructural level. Inter and transgranular cracking, as well as anisotropic effects of both elasticity and preferential cleavage directions within each randomly oriented crystal are taken into account. For this purpose, the proposed phase field formulation includes: (a) a smeared description of grain boundaries as cohesive zones avoiding defining an additional phase for grains; (b) an anisotropic phase field model; (c) a multi-phase field formulation where each preferential cleavage direction is associated with a damage (phase field) variable. The obtained framework allows modeling interactions and competition between grains and grain boundary cracks, as well as their effects on the effective response of the material. The proposed model is illustrated through several numerical examples involving a full description of complex crack initiation and propagation within 2D and 3D models of polycrystals.",['spi']
Crack initiation in VHCF regime on forged titanium alloy under tensile and torsion loading modes,"This paper is focused on the VHCF behavior of aeronautical titanium alloy under tensile and torsion fatigue loadings. Tensile tests were carried out with two different stress ratios: R = À1 and R = 0.1. Both surface and subsurface crack initiations were observed. In the case of subsurface crack initiation several fatigue life controlling mechanisms of crack initiation were found under fully-reversed loading conditions: initiation from (1) strong defects; (2) ‘macro-zone’ borders; (3) quasi-smooth facets and (4) smooth facets. Tests with stress ratio R = 0.1, have shown that initiation from the borders of ‘macro-zones’ becomes the dominant crack initiation mechanism in presence of positive mean stress. Like for the tensile results, surface and subsurface crack initiations were observed under ultrasonic torsion in spite of the maximum shear stress location on the specimen surface. But the real reason for the subsurface crack initiation under torsion was not found.",['spi']
Three-dimensional constitutive model for structural and functional fatigue of shape memory alloy actuators,"A three-dimensional constitutive model is developed that describes the behavior of shape memory alloy actuators undergoing a large number of cycles leading to the development of internal damage and eventual catastrophic failure. Physical mechanisms such as transformation strain generation and recovery, transformation-induced plasticity, and fatigue damage associated with martensitic phase transformation occurring during cyclic loading are all considered within a thermodynamically consistent framework. Fatigue damage in particular is described utilizing a continuum theory of damage. The total damage growth rate has been formulated as a function of the current stress state and the rate of martensitic transformation such that the magnitude of recoverable transformation strain and the complete or partial nature of the transformation cycles impact the total cyclic life as per experimental observations. Simulation results from the model developed are compared to uniaxial actuation fatigue tests at different applied stress levels. It is shown that both lifetime and the evolution of irrecoverable strain are accurately predicted by the developed model.",['spi']
Application of Lambda Distributions and Bootstrap analysis to the prediction of fatigue lifetime and confidence intervals,"Dealing with fatigue lifetime prediction, this paper aims to report on a new statistical method combining the Lambda Distributions and the Bootstrap technique. This method is first applied for determining the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the C and n coefficients in the Paris relationship of a fatigue crack propagation curve. Then, introducing the initial crack's length distribution, the fatigue lifetime prediction is obtained and discussed considering various standard deviations of the initial crack's length. It is shown that the scattering of the initial crack's length needs to be taken into account in predicting lifetime, and that the stochastic nature of the crack's propagation is not self-sufficient to explain completely the experimental asymmetry of the PDF lifetime. This paper shows that the Lambda Distributions are a powerful tool for modelling the PDF lifetime, compared with traditional Gaussian or lognormal PDF",['spi']
Influence of loading conditions on the overall mechanical behavior of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK),"Testing methods have been developed to compare the mechanical responses and failure behavior of polyether-ether-keton (PEEK) thermoplastic polymer; under quasi-static, high strain rate tensile tests and fatigue loading. Tensile tests were performed with the strain rates varying from 0.0003 s−1 to 60 s−1 and at different temperatures to compare the flow characteristics of the samples undergone various testing conditions. Fatigue tests at different amplitudes and frequencies were also performed to evaluate the temperature rise during cyclic loading and its effect on the fracture behavior. Results show that dynamic tension, in comparison with quasi-static behavior, causes brittle fracture; whereas under fatigue test at high frequencies and loading amplitudes the material behaves not only a more ductile behavior but also it clearly shows the influences of induced self-heating in the modulus and mechanical properties of the PEEK were significant. So the major aim of this article is to discuss about the induced temperature and its effect on the fracture surface. Thermal fatigue has a very significant role in increasing temperature and reducing fatigue life; from there it is necessary to know the conditions at which thermal fatigue happens and also the amount of energy which is consumed. Obtained equation from the experimental results and calculations can estimate the energy dissipation in the fatigue tests which is as a function of cycle and frequency.",['spi']
Comparative study and link between mesoscopic and energetic approaches in high cycle multiaxial fatigue,"Multiaxial fatigue analysis can be categorized into several viewpoints, i.e. empirical formulae, methods based on stress invariants, critical plane approaches, models using averages of stress quantities and energetic considerations. The aim of this paper is not to survey the current state of knowledge concerning multiaxial fatigue but to critically examine two endurance criteria so as to prove that a direct link can be established between them. The first of the two methods, proposed by Papadopoulos, has been built by exploring the fatigue of metals from the mesoscopic scale, that is from the scale of the metal grains of a metallic aggregate. The localized plastic strains developping in some less favourably oriented crystals is considered to be the main cause of fatigue crack nucleation. According to relationships between macroscopic and mesoscopic quantities, this model is finally expressed in terms of the usual macroscopic stresses relative to an elementary material volume. The second approach proposed by Froustey and Lasserre is an energetic based criterion. It has been deduced from experimental observations concerning multiaxial endurance limit and states that crack initiation occurs as soon as the total strain energy density exceeds a critical value. This paper shows that the critical value of the accumulated mesoscopic plastic strain used by Papadopoulos to characterize the endurance limit can be estimated with the global strain energy density at the macroscopic scale. Indeed, it is demonstrated that when dealing with in-phase or out-of-phase synchronous sinusoidal constant amplitude loadings, a single analytical formulation of these criteria can be written either with stress quantities or with energetic ones describing thus the same physical phenomenon. The mean stress influence is discussed; the predictions of the two approaches are similar when the material remains quasi elastic. Another important result concerns the phase difference of the stress tensor components. Very few approaches are able to predict the independence of the fatigue strength on the phase difference between normal and shear stresses. The two proposed criteria reflect this phenomenon which has been experimentally observed for many metals subjected to combined bending-torsion loading. Nevertheless, this independence with regard to the phase shift is no more effective when dealing with some biaxial stress systems with two normal stresses. In this case the two models are consistent with the experimental results since they show a marked influence of the phase difference.",['spi']
How to reduce the duration of multiaxial fatigue tests under proportional service loadings,"This paper deals with a technique to transform a multiaxial stress and strain-time sequence (in service recorded) in a simplified sequence. This simplified sequence is shorter than the original one and equivalent in terms of damage and lifetime: the number of simplified sequences to crack initiation is equal to the number of original sequences. The proposal is based on an energy threshold, below which no micro-crack can initiate or grow in the material. This technique was validated with real loading sequences recorded by strain gauges pasted on a car suspension arm. Fatigue tests were carried out on smooth specimens made of spheroidal graphite cast iron loaded in bending, in torsion and in combined bending and torsion. Experimental fatigue lives under the original sequence and under the simplified one are in very good correlation. Fatigue test duration is reduced up to a factor of 10 for the severe stress–strain sequences tested in this study.",['spi']
Roughness characteristic length scales of micro-machined surfaces: A multi-scale modelling,"The MEMS structure integrity, their dynamic properties as well as their electrostatic characteristics, strongly depend on the achieved surfaces roughness produced by the micromachining process. It is therefore, not surprising that numerous works are devoted to propose relations between roughness and physical or mechanical properties in this field. Yet the issue is full of complexities since roughness parameters depend on the method used for their evaluation. This article introduces a new approach of the roughness characterization, based on the scaling analysis. Experimental results obtained on micro machined surfaces show that the range roughness amplitude depends on the scan length and that roughness amplitude follows three stages. The stage I is due to a smoothing effect of the surface induced by the tip radius of the profilometer, stage II presents a piecewise power-law roughness distribution until a critical length that characterises the fractal behaviour of the surface, and stage III is characterised by extreme values statistics. The fractal parameter, the extreme values estimators and the crossover between stages II and III are shown to be related to the micromachining process. As a result, an original probabilistic model based on the Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD) is proposed to estimate the multi-scale roughness in the stage III. Finally, thanks to a Bootstrap protocol coupled with a Monte-Carlo simulation, the maximal roughness amplitude probability density function is estimated at a scale higher than the scanning length.","['math', 'spi']"
Fatigue life under non-Gaussian random loading from various models,"Fatigue test results on the 10HNAP steel under constant amplitude and random loading with non-Gaussian probability distribution function, zero mean value and wide-band frequency spectrum have been used to compare the life time estimation of the models proposed by Bannantine, Fatemi–Socie, Socie, Wang–Brown, Morel and Łagoda–Macha. Except the Morel proposal which accumulates damage step by step with a proper ethodology, all the other models use a cycle counting method. The rainflow algorithm is used to extract cycles from random histories of damage parameters in time domain. In the last model, where a strain energy density parameter is employed, additionally spectral method is evaluated for fatigue life calculation in the frequency domain. The best and very similar results of fatigue life assessment have been obtained using the models proposed by Socie and by Łagoda–Macha, both in time and frequency domains for the last one.",['spi']
Refinement of worst-case execution time bounds by graph pruning,"As real-time systems increase in complexity to provide more and more functionality and perform more demanding computations, the problem of statically analyzing the Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) bound of real-time programs is becoming more and more time-consuming and imprecise. The problem stems from the fact that with increasing program size, the number of potentially relevant program and hardware states that need to be considered during WCET analysis increases as well. However, only a relatively small portion of the program actually contributes to the final WCET bound. Large parts of the program are thus irrelevant and are analyzed in vain. In the best case this only leads to increased analysis time. Very often, however, the analysis of irrelevant program parts interferes with the analysis of those program parts that turn out to be relevant. We explore a novel technique based on graph pruning that promises to reduce the analysis overhead and, at the same time, increase the analysis’ precision. The basic idea is to eliminate those program parts from the analysis problem that are known to be irrelevant for the final WCET bound. This reduces the analysis overhead, since only a subset of the program and hardware states have to be tracked. Consequently, more aggressive analysis techniques may be applied, effectively reducing the overestimation of the WCET. As a side-effect, interference from irrelevant program parts is eliminated, e.g., on addresses of memory accesses, on loop bounds, or on the cache or processor state. First experiments using a commercial WCET analysis tool show that our approach is feasible in practice and leads to reductions of up to 12% when a standard IPET approach is used for the analysis.",['info']
A joint multicast/D2D learning-based approach to LTE traffic offloading,"Multicast is the obvious choice for disseminating popular data on cellular networks. In spite of having better spectral efficiency than unicast, its performance is bounded by the user with the worst channel in the cell. To overcome this limitation, we propose to combine multicast with device-to-device (D2D) communications over an orthogonal channel. Such a strategy improves the efficiency of the dissemination process while saving resources at the base station. It is quite challenging, however, to decide which users should be served through multicast transmissions and which ones should receive the content via D2D communications. The progress of content dissemination through D2D communications depends on how users meet while on the move. The optimal decision for each content depends both on the status of the LTE channel (when the multicast transmission is executed) and on the evolution of the mobility process of the nodes from there on. We propose a learning solution based on a multi-armed bandit algorithm that dynamically selects the best allocation of users between multicast and D2D to guarantee the timely delivery of data. Numerical evaluations are performed to compare our proposal with the state-of-the-art scheme and an optimal but unfeasible strategy. We confirm that a proper mix of multicast and D2D helps operators save resources at the base station and that the learning algorithm can autonomously find a near-optimal configuration in a reasonable time.",['info']

We prove that the approximate solution converges uniformly to the optimal constrained interpolating function. An algorithm is derived and numerical examples with boundedness and mono-tonicity constraints in one and two dimensions are given.",['math']

Tolerance analysis — Form defects modeling and simulation by modal decomposition and optimization,"Tolerance analysis aims on checking whether specified tolerances enable functional and assembly requirements. The tolerance analysis approaches discussed in literature are generally assumed without the consideration of parts’ form defects. This paper presents a new model to consider the form defects in an assembly simulation. A Metric Modal Decomposition (MMD) method is henceforth, developed to model the form defects of various parts in a mechanism. The assemblies including form defects are further assessed using mathematical optimization. The optimization involves two models of surfaces: real model and difference surface-base method, and introduces the concept of signed distance. The optimization algorithms are then compared in terms of time consumption and accuracy. To illustrate the methods and their respective applications, a simplified over-constrained industrial mechanism in three dimensions is also used as a case study.",['spi']
Selection and use of a multi-criteria decision aiding method in the context of conceptual design with imprecise information: Application to a solar collector development,"Making decisions on a sound basis in early phases is one of the most difficult challenges in the product development process, especially when dealing with immature concepts. Moreover, life-cycle cost can be influenced up to 70% by decisions taken during the conceptual design phases. The need for reliable multi-criteria decision aiding methods is thus greater in these phases. Various multi-criteria decision aiding methods are proposed and used in the literature. The main criticism of these methods is that they usually produce contradictory results for the same problem. In this work, seven widely used multi-criteria decision aiding methods (weighed sum, weighted product, Kim and Lin, compromise programming, TOPSIS, quadratic mean and ELECTRE I) are analysed. This analysis was based on a real industrial case to develop a solar collector. The proposed multi-criteria decision aiding methods were compared in terms of three criteria deemed relevant in the relevant context: (1) adaptation of the type of results the multi-criteria decision aiding method is expected to bring, (2) correct handling of input information and (3) adaptation of the degree of compensation. Based on these criteria, it was proven that weighted product is the most appropriate multi-criteria decision aiding method in our case. In addition, it has been demonstrated that sensitivity analysis can improve the benefit of using the multi-criteria decision aiding method chosen when dealing with imprecise information due to immaturity of concepts.",['spi']
Efficiency assessment of novel materials based flexible thermoelectric devices by a multiscale modeling approach,"The presented work demonstrates a multiscale approach for evaluating novel materials for room temperature thermoelectric applications and provides some insights into the development of flexible devices composed of those materials. Tetrahedrite is studied as it is a promising p-type thermoelectric material that exhibits good thermoelectric properties at room temperature. Considering our target application, analysis of the theoretical results reveals that tetrahedrite is an interesting surrogate material to bismuth telluride for room temperature applications with a power factor ranging from 4.16 mu W/cm K-2, for the pristine tetrahedrite compound, to around 9 mu W/cm K-2, for a doped tetrahedrite. A single thermocouple made of p-type pristine tetrahedrite and n-type natural chalcopyrite has an optimum output power of 5.53 nW/K. This output power can reach 7.47 nW/K when optimally doping tetrahedrite. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",['chim']
A new ultrasonic fatigue testing device for biaxial bending in the gigacycle regime,A new fatigue testing device has been developed to test specimens under biaxial loading at 20 kHz. The specimen is a flat smooth disc. It is placed on a torus frame and cyclically loaded in compression at the center of its upper face. Consequently disc bending generates a biaxial proportional stress state at the center of the specimen lower face. Any positive loading ratio can be applied. This device has been tested and is well functioning on specimens made of a cast aluminum alloy used to produce cylinder heads. Preliminary results in VHCF regime are compared with literature results obtained under similar stress state but in HCF regime and at 20 Hz only.,['spi']
Low-velocity impact tests on carbon/epoxy composite laminates: A benchmark study,"Low-velocity impacts (LVI) on composite laminates pose significant safety issues since they are able to generate extended damage within the structure, mostly delaminations and matrix cracking, while being hardly detectable in visual inspections. The role of LVI tests at the coupon level is to evaluate quantities that can be useful both in the design process, such as the delamination threshold load, and in dealing with safety issues, that is correlating the internal damage with the indentation depth. This paper aims at providing a benchmark of LVIs on quasi-isotropic carbon/epoxy laminates; 2 laminates are tested, 16 and 24 plies and a total of 8 impact energies have been selected ranging from very low energy impacts up to around 30 J. Delamination threshold loads, shape and extension of délaminations as well as post-impact 3D measurements of the impacted surface have been carried out in order to characterize the behavior of the considered material system in LVIs. The analysis of test results relevant to the lowest energies pointed out that large contact force fluctuations, typically associated to delamination onset, occurred but ultrasonic scans did not reveal any significant internal damage. Due to these unexpected results, such tests were further investigated through a detailed FE model. The results of this investigation highlights the detrimental effects of the dissipative mechanisms of the impactor. A combined numericale-experimental approach is thus proposed to evaluate the effective impact energies.",['spi']
Fast fatigue life prediction of short fiber reinforced composites using a new hybrid damage approach: Application to SMC,"Industrial design of Short Fiber Reinforced Composites (SFRC) structures is subject to several compounding and processing steps of optimization. Moreover, these structures are often submitted to fatigue loading. Therefore, SN curves have to be established for each new composite formulation and for several type of microstructure involved in the real component due to processing. While these preliminary characterizations are time and money consuming, this paper propose a new hybrid methodology for fast fatigue life prediction. Moreover, both monotonic and fatigue behavior of SMC composites is essentially determined by local damage propagation. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed approach is to use a Mori and Tanaka based micromechanical model in order to establish an equation of state relating local damage rate to macroscopic residual stiffness rate. The generalization of this relation to fatigue damage multi-scale description leads to the SN curve fast determination of each considered microstructure. Very limited experimental characterization is required in such a way that SN curve could be established in just one day. Comparison between experimental and simulated Whöler curves highlights a very good agreement for several microstructure configurations in the case of a SMC composite material.",['spi']
Multi-scale experimental investigation of the viscous nature of damage in Advanced Sheet Molding Compound (A-SMC) submitted to high strain rates,"This paper aims to present an experimental multi-scale analysis of quasi-static and high strain rate damage behavior of a new formulation of SMC composite (Advanced SMC). In order to study its capability to absorb energy through damage accumulation, Randomly Oriented (RO) and High oriented (HO) A-SMC composites damage has been investigated at both microscopic and macroscopic scales. A specific device has been developed in order to perform Interrupted Dynamic Tensile Tests (IDTT) which allows analyzing the evolution of the microscopic damage mechanisms occurring during rapid tensile tests. Several damage micro-mechanisms have been pointed out. The relative influences of these micro-damage events and their interactions have been related to the macroscopic damage behavior through the definition of microscopic and macroscopic damage indicators. Damage threshold and kinetic have been quantified at various strain rate for different microstructures and loading cases (RO, HO-0 and HO-90). It has been shown at both scales that increasing strain rate leads to an onset of damage initiation together with a reduction of the damage accumulation kinetic. Moreover, the influence of the fiber orientation has been studied in order to emphasize the anisotropic strain rate effect at the fiber-matrix interface scale. The latter was related to the influence of the microstructure of A-SMC composites. Finally, on the basis of the whole experimental results, the microscopic origin of the viscous nature of the damage behavior of A-SMCs composites have been discussed and related to the influence of the strain rate and microstructure.",['spi']
A volumetric energy based high cycle multiaxial fatigue citerion,"A reliable design of industrial parts against high-cycle multiaxial fatigue requires a fatigue criterion capable of predicting both the stress gradient and the load-type effects. These effects are very important in the transfer of fatigue data from specimen to component. By using the concept of volume influencing fatigue crack initiation proposed by Palin-Luc and Lasserre with an energy based approach, a new criterion is presented. Based on the strain-work density given to the material, this proposal is usable whatever the constant amplitude loading is: in and out-of-phase combined loadings, with or without mean stress. Its predictions are compared both with a total of 38 experiments on four materials (a mild steel, two high strength steels and a spheroidal graphite cast iron) and with the predictions of local criteria (Crossland, Dang Van, Papadopoulos and Morel). The comparison shows that the predictions of the volumetric proposal are very good and less scattered than those of the local approaches, especially for loadings with mean stresses or under non-proportional loadings.",['spi']
Estimation of the fatigue strength distribution in high-cycle multiaxial fatigue taking into account the stress–strain gradient effect,"Based on the weakest link concept, a probabilistic approach in high-cycle multiaxial fatigue is developed to predict, for a given number of cycles, the probability distribution of the fatigue strength for metallic structural components. A three-parameter Weibull distribution is combined with the energy-based and volumetric high-cycle multiaxial fatigue criterion proposed by Banvillet et al. in 2002 [Banvillet A, Palin-Luc T, Lasserre S. A volumetric energy based high cycle multiaxial fatigue criterion. Int J Fatigue 2003;26(8):755–69; Banvillet A, Palin-Luc T, Lasserre, S, Vittori JF. Energy based high cycle multiaxial fatigue criterion depending on stress–strain distribution. In: Blom AF, editor. Fatigue 2002: Eighth international fatigue congress, vol. 1, EMAS: Stockholm; 2002, p. 283–90]. Whatever the stress state and the loading type are, the corresponding fatigue strength probability distribution can be deduced from three usual experimental fatigue limits. The scale effect is also predicted. Experimental probability distributions and theoretical predictions of the fatigue strength of smooth specimens are in good agreement for the five materials investigated: the 30NiCrMo16 and 35CrMo4 quenched and tempered steels, the C20 annealed steel, the EN-GJS800-2 nodular cast iron and the Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy.",['spi']
From steady to unsteady laminar flow in model porous structures: an investigation of the first Hopf bifurcation,"This work focuses on the occurrence of the first Hopf bifurcation, corresponding to the transition from steady to unsteady flow conditions, on 2D periodic ordered and disordered non-deformable porous structures. The structures under concern, representative of real systems for many applications, are composed of cylinders of square cross section for values of the porosity ranging from 15% to 96%. The critical Reynolds number at the bifurcation is determined for incompressible isothermal Newtonian fluid flow by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) based on a finite volume discretization method that is second order accurate in space and time. It is shown that for ordered square periodic structures, the critical Reynolds number increases when the porosity decreases and strongly depends on the choice of the Representative Elementary Volume on which periodic boundary conditions are employed. The flow orientation with respect to the principal axes of the structure is also shown to have a very important impact on the value of the Reynolds number of the bifurcation. When structural disorder is introduced, the critical Reynolds number decreases very significantly in comparison to the ordered structure having the same porosity. Correlations between the critical Reynolds number and the porosity are obtained on both ordered and disordered structures over wide range of porosities. A frequency analysis is performed on one of the velocity components to investigate pre- and post-bifurcation flow characteristics.","['spi', 'phys']"
Effects of Weight-Related Literal and Metaphorical Suggestions About the Forearms During Hypnosis,"Abstract: During hypnosis, the authors tested repeated weight-related, literal and metaphorical suggestions about the heaviness of the subjects’ arms. The purpose was to determine if linguistically varied hypnotic suggestions produced significantly different motor reactions—involuntary pressure forces of the forearms—as assessed by a linguistic biomechanical system. Classic, literal (L) suggestions such as “your right arm is heavy” were used, as well as metaphorical (M) suggestions, such as “your right arm is made of lead.” A specific effect on the progressive increase of pressure forces only in the temporal sequence L-M for each forearm (literal suggestions followed by metaphorical suggestions) was found. This effect, termed crescendo image metaphor effect, conceptualized within context-limited simulation theory, explains the findings.","['scco', 'shs']"
On the use of voice descriptors for glottal source shape parameter estimation,"This paper summarizes the results of our investigations into estimating the shape of the glottal excitation source from speech signals. We employ the Liljencrants-Fant (LF) model describing the glottal flow and its derivative. The one-dimensional glottal source shape parameter Rd describes the transition in voice quality from a tense to a breathy voice. The parameter Rd has been derived from a statistical regression of the R waveshape parameters which parameterize the LF model. First, we introduce a variant of our recently proposed adaptation and range extension of the Rd parameter regression. Secondly, we discuss in detail the aspects of estimating the glottal source shape parameter Rd using the phase minimization paradigm. Based on the analysis of a large number of speech signals we describe the major conditions that are likely to result in erroneous Rd estimates. Based on these findings we investigate into means to increase the robustness of the Rd parameter estimation. We use Viterbi smoothing to suppress unnatural jumps of the estimated Rd parameter contours within short time segments. Additionally, we propose to steer the Viterbi algorithm by exploiting the covariation of other voice descriptors to improve Viterbi smoothing. The novel Viterbi steering is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that represents the joint density of the voice descriptors and the Open Quotient (OQ) estimated from corresponding electroglottographic (EGG) signals. A conversion function derived from the mixture model predicts OQ from the voice descriptors. Converted to Rd it defines an additional prior probability to adapt the partial probabilities of the Viterbi algorithm accordingly. Finally, we evaluate the performances of the phase minimization based methods using both variants to adapt and extent the Rd regression on one synthetic test set as well as in combination with Viterbi smoothing and each variant of the novel Viterbi steering on one test set of natural speech. The experimental findings exhibit improvements for both Viterbi approaches.","['info', 'spi']"
Modeling of coupled phase transformation and reorientation in shape memory alloys under non-proportional thermomechanical loading,"In the present study, a new 3D thermodynamic coupled model is proposed for SMAs. The behavior of SMA structures is described through several strain mechanisms, each associated with its proper internal variables. This model is built to capture the particular behavior of SMAs when subjected to complex loading, namely non-proportional thermomechanical loading. To achieve this task, a new approach to describe the martensitic reorientation mechanism has been introduced in conjuction with a new method to account for forward and reverse transformation. Thermomechanical coupling, related to dissipation and latent heat is fully implemented. The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing experimental results of complex thermomechanical loading paths of SMA structures with numerical simulations.",['spi']
Distinct and combined effects of disciplinary composition and methodological support on problem solving in groups,"Several reasons for the use of multidisciplinary teams composed of individuals with natural science and engineering background in problem‐solving processes exist. The most important are the integration of science‐based technologies into products and processes, and benefits for the problem‐solving process thanks to new knowledge and new perspectives on problems. In this study we analyse the implications of interdisciplinary (science – engineering) group problem solving from a managerial as well as from a cognitive perspective. We then report on an experiment investigating the impact of problem‐relevant disciplinary group composition and methodological support on the problem‐solving process and its outcome. The findings of the experiment have managerial, theoretical, and pedagogical implications related to early phases of New Product/Process Design processes in high‐technology and scientific knowledge‐related domains.",['spi']
A framework for manufacturing execution system deployment in an advanced additive manufacturing process,"The deployment of additive manufacturing (AM) processes had a rapid and broad increase in the last years, and the same trend is expected to hold in the near future. A way to better exploit the advantages of such technology is the use of appropriate information tools. However, today there is a lack of software applications devoted to this innovative manufacturing process. To overcome this issue, in the present work the application of manufacturing execution systems (MES), a tool commonly used in traditional manufacturing processes, is extended to AM. Furthermore, a framework for the deployment of shop-floor data, acquired through a monitoring system, in the design phase is presented: hence, MES should cooperate with design for additive manufacturing (DFAM), a set of methods and tools helpful to design a product and its manufacturing process taking into account AM specificities from the early design stages. In order to better understand the advantages of such cooperation, a case study for a proof of concept has been developed: the obtained results are promising, thus an online implementation would be recommended.",['spi']
Requirement Mining for Model-Based Product Design,"PLM software applications should enable engineers to develop and manage requirements throughout the product’s lifecycle. However, PLM activities of the beginning-of-life and end-of-life of a product mainly deal with a fastidious document-based approach. Indeed, requirements are scattered in many different prescriptive documents (reports, specifications, standards, regulations, etc.) that make the feeding of a requirements management tool laborious. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to extract requirements from prescriptive documents. Second, we show how machine learning techniques can be used to develop a text classifier that will automatically classify requirements into disciplines. Both contributions support companies willing to feed a requirements management tool from prescriptive documents. The NLP experiment shows an average precision of 0.86 and an average recall of 0.95, whereas the SVM requirements classifier outperforms that of naive Bayes with a 76% accuracy rate.",['info']
Multi-level modeling of viscoelastic microcracked masonry,"This paper provides multi-level modeling of microcracked viscoelastic masonries generally present in historical masonries or refractory linings. It is an extension of the Cecchi and Tralli (2012) or Cecchi & Barbieri (2008) and Cecchi & Taliercio (2013) works for the typical Burgers and Modified Maxwell models followed by both undamaged and microcracked masonries. For the sake of simplicity and in order to provide rigorous analytical global estimates, only the mortar is assumed to be viscoelastic and microcracked. Bricks are assumed to be undamaged, elastic or quasi-rigid. The distribution of microcracks is assumed to be isotropic. The effective behavior of the viscoelastic microcracked masonry is provided by two steps. The first one relies on the coupling between the Griffith’s brittle fracture theory and linear mean-field homogenization scheme in order to account for the effect of microcracks on the macroscopic deformation of the mortar and establishes a linear relation between apparent macroscopic stress and strain. This step allows to easily and fast determine the effective creep function of the microcracked mortar without recourse to ’complex’ or heavy numerical inversion of the Laplace–Carson transform. The second step is based on the coupling between asymptotic analysis and homogenization theory applied for a periodic masonry. The proposed models provide analytical solutions - explicit functions of the crack density parameter - for the effective orthotropic behavior of a microcracked viscoelastic periodic masonry cell. This study proves that the Cecchi & Tralli’s and Cecchi & Taliercio’s extension estimates are close and that the later are softer. Such overall properties are used to perform finite element computations on a compressed masonry panel as a first application. These models allow then the prediction of mostly stressed and deformed areas in microcracked masonry structures. This study demonstrates that modeling a mortar (at its undamaged or microcracked state) with this Burgers formulation is only suitable for a masonry with too high values of the Maxwell’s relaxation time otherwise it yields to vanishing effective properties with the increase of time and crack density leading thus to a premature collapse of the masonry. On the other hand, the Modified Maxwell model permits the masonry to preserve a certain resistance for every range value of Maxwell’s relaxation time. These conclusions are valid for masonry either with elastic or quasi-rigid undamaged bricks.",['spi']
Reevaluation of the diametral compression test for tablets using the flattened disc geometry,"Mechanical strength is an important critical quality attribute for tablets. It is classically measured, in the pharmaceutical field, using the diametral compression test. Nevertheless, due to small contact area between the tablet and the platens, some authors suggested that during the test, the failure could occur in tension away from the center which would invalidate the test and the calculation of the tensile strength. In this study, the flattened disc geometry was used as an alternative to avoid contact problems. The diametral compression on both flattened and standard geometries was first studied using finite element method (FEM) simulation. It was found that, for the flattened geometry, both maximum tensile strain and stress were located at the center of the tablet, which was not the case for the standard geometry. Experimental observations using digital image correlation (DIC) confirmed the numerical results. The experimental tensile strength obtained using both geometries were compared and it was found that the standard geometry always gave lower tensile strength than the flattened geometry. Finally, high-speed video capture of the test made it possible to detect that for the standard geometry the crack initiation was always away from the center of the tablet.","['sdv', 'spi']"
Applying Autonomy with Bandwidth Allocation Models,"Bandwidth Allocation Models (BAMs) are resource allocation methods used for networks in general. BAMs are currently applied for handling resources such as bandwidth allocation in MPLS DS-TE networks (LSP setup). In general, BAMs defines resource restrictions by "" class "" and allocate the available resources on demand. This is frequently necessary to manage large and complex systems like routing networks. G-BAM is a new generalized BAM that, by configuration, incorporates the "" behavior "" of existing BAMs (MAM, RDM, G-RDM and AllocTC-Sharing).

In brief, it is investigated the switching among "" BAM behaviors "" and BAM´s reconfiguration with distinct network traffic scenarios by using G-BAM.

Emerging technologies and computing paradigms for the Internet of Everything applications,"Emerging Internet of Everything (IoE) applications and Artificial Intelligence (AI) require computing platforms to extract task‐relevant information from increasingly large amounts of data. But these requirements place stringent constraints on energy efficiency, performance, cost, and reliability. Traditionally, silicon CMOS scaling has been relied upon to meet these energy and delay constraints. However, the energy and delay benefits achievable via scaling are diminishing. Therefore, there is an urge to explore new energy‐efficient devices and interconnects as the building blocks for energy efficient systems. Moreover, we need to rethink how architectures and systems are designed to optimize power, performance, and reliability. This will require to investigate novel devices beyond CMOS and novel computing paradigms beyond Von‐Neumman to achieve a remarkable improvement in performance, cost, reliability, and energy efficiency.","['info', 'spi']"
LCA of EVP - Engineering Veneer Product: plywood glued using a vacuum moulding technology from green veneers,"The production of plywood represents a major proportion of engineered wood products. The traditional manufacturing process requires very thorough drying of the wood before gluing. Gluing green wood is a new technology which can be applied to plywood vacuum moulding. Gluing wood when it is in a green state can be done, because it can be dried by the vacuum at the same time that pressure is applied for the gluing. The main interest of this method is that it reduces considerably the number of steps in its manufacture. The aim of this paper is to propose a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to validate the use of the vacuum process with green veneers. The types of glue, the gluing techniques (by vacuum or traditional methods) and the wood varieties have been compared. The functional analysis focused on 4 traditional plywood in order to compare it with our product. The 5 products meet the quality requirements of plywood EN 13986 (2004). The environmental modelling was carried out according to the ISO 14040, standard of life cycle assessment, principles and framework, starting from existing data bases and from measurements taken on manufacturing sites and during the testing. The model shows that there is a significant interest in the technology of gluing green wood with a vacuum process compared to the conventional approach. For an industrial use, the disadvantage of this new technology is the use of consumables but that could be reduced considerably in industrial production by using reusable consumables.","['spi', 'sde', 'chim']"
Analytical modeling of a thin-walled cylindrical workpiece during the turning process. Stability analysis of a cutting process,"The purpose of this work is to develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of turning a thin-walled cylindrical shell. This model uses a finite number of degrees of freedom and takes into account the variability of dynamic compliance. It is then possible to obtain estimates of the boundaries of stability of the continuous cutting process. The model is based on the theory of shells with application of Galerkin’s method in conjunction with the expansion of the displacement field in beam and trigonometric functions. On the basis of the developed model, an algorithm designed for constructing boundaries of stability of turning of the thin-walled cylindrical parts is presented and compared to experimental results.

Flank wear prediction in milling AISI 4140 based on cutting forces PCA for different cutting edge preparations,"One of the criteria mastering the choice of a cutting tool is its wear resistance. For coated inserts, prior to the coating process, edge preparation method choice will impact their performance. So, a classification based on its impact on wear resistance is needed. Indeed, the flank wear of three coated cemented carbide inserts presenting differently prepared edges (untreated, dragging and magneto-abrasive machining) is explored experimentally. Those inserts are used to face mill the hardened AISI 4140 low alloy steel. Further, by means of the principal component analysis (PCA), correlations between the online measured cutting forces and flank wear behaviour are investigated. In view of this analysis, for each studied case, the statistical law predicting flank wear relying on cutting forces components is established with fair approximation. However, the experimental results have quantitatively shown that edge preparation could be in some cases not beneficial for tool wear resistance of the milling inserts considering either maximal or average flank wear.",['spi']
Ontology and protocol secure for SCADA,"In this work, we present a semantic cyber security system and we study its semantic intelligent systems vulnerabilities, focusing on the semantic attacks.

We used a security block in the global network access point, security protocols deployed in different network (OSI) levels and security ontologies deployed in security devices. We used our mixed coordinates (ECC) cryptography solution, this is an encryption technology developed specifically for low latency embedded applications.

Nonlinear Tax Incidence and Optimal Taxation in General Equilibrium,"We study the incidence of nonlinear labor income taxes in an economy with a continuum of endogenous wages. We derive in closed form the effects of reforming nonlinearly an arbitrary tax system, by showing that this problem can be formalized as an integral equation. Our tax incidence formulas are valid both when the underlying assignment of skills to tasks is fixed or endogenous. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that contrary to conventional wisdom, if the tax system is initially suboptimal and progressive, the general-equilibrium trickle-down forces may raise the benefits of increasing the marginal tax rates on high incomes. We finally derive a parsimonious characterization of optimal taxes.",['shs']
Localized necking predictions based on rate-independent self-consistent polycrystal plasticity: Bifurcation analysis versus imperfection approach,"The present study focuses on the development of a relevant numerical tool for predicting the onset of localized necking in polycrystalline aggregates. The latter are assumed to be representative of thin metal sheets. In this tool, a micromechanical model, based on the rate-independent self-consistent multi-scale scheme, is developed to accurately describe the mechanical behavior of polycrystalline aggregates from that of their single crystal constituents. In the current paper, the constitutive framework at the single crystal scale follows a finite strain formulation of the rate-independent theory of crystal elastoplasticity. To predict the occurrence of localized necking in polycrystalline aggregates, this micromechanical modeling is combined with two main strain localization approaches: the bifurcation analysis and the initial imperfection method. The formulation of both strain localization indicators takes into consideration the plane stress conditions to which thin metal sheets are subjected during deformation. From a numerical point of view, strain localization analysis with this crystal plasticity approach can be viewed as a strongly nonlinear problem. Hence, several numerical algorithms and techniques are developed and implemented in the aim of efficiently solving this non-linear problem. Various simulation results obtained by the application of the developed numerical tool are presented and extensively discussed. It is demonstrated from these results that the predictions obtained with the MarciniakeKuczynski procedure tend towards those yielded by the bifurcation theory, when the initial imperfection ratio tends towards zero. Furthermore, the above result is shown to be valid for both scale-transition schemes, namely the full-constraint Taylor model and self-consistent scheme.",['spi']
Strain localization analysis for planar polycrystals based on bifurcation theory,"In the present paper, an efficient numerical tool is developed to investigate the ductility limit of polycrystalline aggregates under in-plane biaxial loading. These aggregates are assumed to be representative of very thin sheet metals (with typically few grains through the thickness). Therefore, the plane-stress assumption is naturally adopted to numerically predict the occurrence of strain localization. Furthermore, the initial crystallographic texture is assumed to be planar. Considering the latter assumptions, a two-dimensional single crystal model is advantageously chosen to describe the mechanical behavior at the microscopic scale. The mechanical behavior of the planar polycrystalline aggregate is derived from that of single crystals by using the full-constraint Taylor scale-transition scheme. To predict the occurrence of localized necking, the developed multiscale model is coupled with the bifurcation theory. As will be demonstrated through various numerical results, in the case of biaxial loading under plane-stress conditions, the planar single crystal model provides the same predictions as those given by the more commonly used three-dimensional single crystal model. Moreover, the use of the two-dimensional model instead of the three-dimensional one allows dividing the number of active slip systems by two and, hence, significantly reducing the CPU time required for the integration of the constitutive equations at the single crystal scale. Furthermore, the planar polycrystal model seems to be more suitable to study the ductility of very thin sheet metals, as its use allows us to rigorously ensure the plane-stress state, which is not always the case when the fully three-dimensional polycrystalline model is employed. Consequently, the adoption of this planar formulation, instead of the three-dimensional one, allows us to simplify the computational aspects and, accordingly, to considerably reduce the CPU time required for the numerical predictions.",['spi']

Biomedical term extraction: overview and a new methodology,"Terminology extraction is an essential task in domain knowledge acquisition, as well as for Information Retrieval (IR). It is also a mandatory first step aimed at building/enriching terminologies and ontologies. As often proposed in the literature, existing terminology extraction methods feature linguistic and statistical aspects and solve some problems related (but not completely) to term extraction, e.g. noise, silence, low frequency, large-corpora, complexity of the multi-word term extraction process. In contrast, we propose a cutting edge methodology to extract and to rank biomedical terms, covering the all mentioned problems. This methodology offers several measures based on linguistic, statistical, graphic and web aspects. These measures extract and rank candidate terms with excellent precision: we demonstrate that they outperform previously reported precision results for automatic term extraction, and work with different languages (English, French, and Spanish). We also demonstrate how the use of graphs and the web to assess the significance of a term candidate, enables us to outperform precision results.

Biomedical Terminology Extraction: A new combination of Statistical and Web Mining Approaches,"The objective of this work is to combine statistical and web mining methods for the automatic extraction, and ranking of biomedical terms from free text. We present new extraction methods that use linguistic patterns specialized for the biomedical field, and use term extraction measures, such as C-value, and keyword extraction measures, such as Okapi BM25, and TFIDF. We propose several combinations of these measures to improve the extraction and ranking process and we investigate which combinations are more relevant for different cases. Each measure gives us a ranked list of candidate terms that we finally re-rank with a new web-based measure. Our experiments show, first that an appropriate harmonic mean of C-value used with keyword extraction measures offers better precision results than used alone, either for the extraction of single-word and multi-words terms; second, that best precision results are often obtained when we re-rank using the web-based measure. We illustrate our results on the extraction of English and French biomedical terms from a corpus of laboratory tests available online in both languages. The results are validated by using UMLS (in English) and only MeSH (in French) as reference dictionary.",['info']

Guide for implementing ecological intensification of aquaculture systemsGuide de mise en oeuvre de l'intensification écologique pour les systèmes aquacoles,"The rapid development of aquaculture in the world has offered, depending on the species and territory, examples of “success stories” but has sometimes also led to social or environmental crises. The issue of food security in 2050 requires improving technology and practices while moving toward practices of “sustainable aquaculture”. These changes promote territorial integration and need to be better recognized and mastered. The framework proposed by ecological intensification of agricultural systems offers an opportunity to redefine objectives for aquaculture by promoting ecological mechanisms to maintain or increase production in these systems. It thus consists of diversifying pathways to sustainable aquaculture and promoting the strengthening of ecological functions while considering sociological and governance constraints. Thus, the objective of this guide, the fruit of an interdisciplinary research project among French, Brazilian, and Indonesian partners, is to propose pathways for implementation of ecological intensification in aquatic ecosystems of aquaculture. To do so, it supplies (i) many potential objectives based on concepts of agro-ecology, ecosystem services, and processes for co-constructing eco-innovations; (ii) assessment tools (indicators); and (iii) examples of experiments in four types of contrasting aquaculture systems. This guide is addressed to a wide public: representatives of supply chains or aquaculture producers, representatives of territorial governments or administrations, and more generally, all members of NGOs or associations interested in development of aquaculture and/or setting up of integrated territorial projects, but also researchers and students as well as all actors wishing to implement ecological intensification, including outside the field of aquaculture.",['sdv']
Can nuclear power save the Kyoto protocol?,"The Kyoto Protocol is now a legally binding treaty signed by 141 nations, although not by major polluting nations such as the United States, China and India. Can nuclear power, which is carbon free, save Kyoto and solve the global warming problem? Nuclear energy is a tough sell in the developed countries, but developing countries continue to rely heavily on it. Many new nuclear power plants are under construction. We develop an empirical Hotelling model that accounts for the limited stock of uranium, future efficiency improvements in nuclear technology and recycling of nuclear waste. The model shows that currently known stocks of uranium may be exhausted in a few decades. But advanced nuclear reactors can provide clean energy for a long time. However, the role of nuclear power may be much diminished even with modest technological change in fossil fuels and solar energy.",['shs']
Estimation of the Boundary of a Variable Observed with A Symmetric Error,"Consider the model with , where tau is an unknown constant (the boundary of X), Z is a random variable defined on , epsilon is a symmetric error, and epsilon and Z are independent. Based on an iid sample of Y, we aim at identifying and estimating the boundary tau when the law of epsilon is unknown (apart from symmetry) and in particular its variance is unknown. We propose an estimation procedure based on a minimal distance approach and by making use of Laguerre polynomials. Asymptotic results as well as finite sample simulations are shown. The paper also proposes an extension to stochastic frontier analysis, where the model is conditional to observed variables. The model becomes , where Y is a cost, w(1) are the observed outputs and w(2) represents the observed values of other conditioning variables, so Z is the cost inefficiency. Some simulations illustrate again how the approach works in finite samples, and the proposed procedure is illustrated with data coming from post offices in France.",['shs']
"L’aversion au risque, composante essentielle du prix du risque, est-elle stable dans le temps ?","Risk aversion is the well documented psychological bias that makes us refuse to participate in zero-sum lotteries: to accept a 50 % chance loss of one dollar, we need to be offered a 50 % chance gain of more than 1 dollar, e.g. two dollars instead of one – a compensation for taking risk. Through the same mechanism, investors must be rewarded for accepting to take on financial risk: they are compensated by receiving greater average returns than risk-free assets – the equity risk premium. We have evidence that this compensation for risk varies over time: investors can expect to receive greater returns when the indice levels are low relative to distributed dividends than when they are high. Does it come from time variations in risk aversion or are there other forces at play? Indirect evidence suggests not only the compensation for risk but also the quantity of risk in financial markets may vary over time. Variations in risk aversion would thus not be the sole channel for changes in equity risk premia over time, though it may still play an important role. Disentangling the two sources of variations in the price of risk – risk aversion and quantity of risk – and understanding why and how they may vary over time is at the core of the recent research in asset pricing theory.",['shs']

The variation of consumer behaviours and perceptions concerning the same product: a case study by an expertVariation des comportements et des perceptions des consommateurs face à un même produit : étude de cas,"«Tell me what you eat and I will tell you who you are,” claimed Brillat Savarin in his book the Physiology of Taste. From the first minutes following birth, or even before, we are exposed to multiple stimuli from an environment specific to our culture. This early cultural experience, associated with the culture-transmitting part played by parents, has a lasting influence on what we eat, how we prepare our food and how it is eaten. In today’s context of globalization of agri-food markets, it seems important to understand the changes in behavior and perception caused by our cultural heritage in order to offer suitable products. To illustrate my point I will draw on a study that was conducted as part of the FUI NUTRICE project spearheaded by SEB. The objective of this FUI project was to improve the nutritional and organoleptic qualities of rice while meeting consumer expectations. Rice is widely consumed worldwide but it is prepared, cooked and eaten very differently according to the culture, region, and type of rice used. To understand these differences, we used a qualitative approach based on observation of reality and focusing on practices and imagination. This approach means we are able to underline the differences in behavior in terms of purchasing mode, preparation and consumption, and to understand the causes of these differences and their impact on consumer perceptions.",['sdv']
Comparative environmental life cycle assessment of materials in wooden boat ecodesign,"Purpose: Wooden boatyard building has been replaced in the 70’s in favor of materials which are considered cheaper and simpler to work with (such as composite or aluminium). With today's new environmental standards, the choices of materials must also be compatible with the aims of ecodesign. We promote wood based boats, and replacing exotic woods with local varieties (from France). An environmental impact assessment is needed to clarify the relative position of each solution. Methods: In order to validate the choices, we used a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ""from cradle to grave"" of the hull. This LCA is based on the comparison of the different materials used: aluminum, composite, exotic wood and maritime pine. This study is based on the construction of an 18-meter-long passenger transport boat. These evaluations were carried out with respect to ISO 14040 standards, beginning with an existing database and measurements taken on the building and production sites. Results: Our results demonstrate the benefits of using a wood-based hull compared to other materials. Moreover, the results show that the maritime pine used in replacement of imported exotic woods is more favorable from both economic and environmental points of view. This LCA allowed us to characterize precisely the stages in the life cycle of a passenger boat and to propose a hierarchy between the different materials under comparison for the purposes of boat building. The recommendations and lines of progress highlighted by this study will allow us to enhance the efficiency of upcoming constructions and to promote the ecodesign conception in the boatyard.",['spi']
Experimental study of the miscibility of ABS/PC polymer blends and investigation of the processing effect,"In the challenging prospect of developing new materials by mixing different polymers to reach a synergetic performance, the present research focuses on the study of the miscibility of two polymers: The acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) composed of a dispersed elastomeric (polybutadiene rubber) polymer embedded in a SAN thermoplastic matrix, and the polycarbonate (PC). It shall be noted that obtaining miscible polymer blends is often a difficult task because of the large size of their molecular chains and the high interfacial tension between the polymer phases. Until now, the most numerous researches developed in this field involve polymer blends obtained by compatibilization techniques in order to improve the interfacial adhesion between initial polymers. The aim of this work is to study the miscibility between ABS and PC. First, two different methods were used to mix the polymers: the twin-screw extrusion and the dissolution in a common solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF). Then, physicochemical, microscopic observation and rheological characterization were performed on samples of mixtures obtained by both extrusion processing and dissolution method. The measurement of glassy transition temperature (Tg) by differential scanning calorimetry measurements (DSC) and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) have shown a partial miscibility between the two polymers.","['chim', 'spi']"
Time-dependent life cycle assessment of microalgal biorefinery co-products,"Microalgae can serve as a highly productive biological feedstock for fuels and chemicals. The lipid fraction has been the primary target of research, but numerous assessments have found that valorization of co-products is essential to achieve economic and environmental goals. The relative proportion of co-products depends on the biomolecular composition of algae at the time of harvesting. In the present study, the productivity of lipid, starch, and protein fractions were shown through growth experiments to vary widely with species, feeding regime, and harvesting period. Four algae species were cultivated under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions and analyzed at 3-day intervals. Dynamic growth results were then used for life cycle assessment using the US Department of Energy's GREET model to determine optimal growth scenarios that minimize life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, eutrophication, and cumulative energy demand (CED), while aiming for an energy return on investment (EROI) greater than unity. Per kg of biodiesel produced, C. sorokiniana in N-replete conditions harvested at 12 days was most favorable for GHG emissions and CED, despite having a lipid content of <20%. N. oculata in N-deplete conditions with a 12-day harvesting period had the lowest life cycle eutrophication impacts, driven by efficient nutrient cycling and valorization of microalgal protein and anaerobic digester residue co-products. Results indicate that growth cycle times that maximize a single fraction do not necessarily result in the most favorable environmental performance on a life cycle basis, underscoring the importance of designing biorefinery systems that -simultaneously optimize for lipid and non-lipid fractions.","['sdv', 'sde']"
Simulation of a helicopter’s main gearbox semiactive suspension with bond graphs,"This paper presents a bond graph model of a helicopter’s semiactive suspension and the associated simulations. The structural and modular approach proposed with bond graph permits a systematic modeling of mechatronic multibody systems. This approach was carried out thanks to the use of the singular perturbation method, which is a variant of penalty formulation. The model is then built as an assembly of components or modules (rigid bodies and compliant kinematic joints) by following the structure of the actual system. The bond graph model of the passive suspension with fixed flapping masses has been verified with another multibody tool for three different excitations (pumping, roll, and yaw). Next, the passive model, augmented with electrical actuators and controllers, is called the semiactive suspension model. Simulations on the semiactive suspension model have been conducted.",['spi']
New alginate foams: Box-Behnken design of their manufacturing; fire retardant and thermal insulating properties,"A new method for preparing alginate foams with progressive release of copper in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS, foaming agent) has been designed. Copper acts as the ionotropic gelling agent through the reaction of copper carbonate with gluconolactone. The process does not require freeze‐drying contrarily to the conventional method used for preparing macroporous alginate foams. The new materials investigated in this study have remarkable thermal properties, including thermal conductivity lower than 0.041 W m−1 K−1 and low heat release (below 2 kJ g−1), which allows labeling these foams self‐extinguishing materials. An experimental design methodology, based on a Box‐Behnken plan with three parameters and three levels, is successfully used for evaluating the impact of the amounts of alginate, SLS, and copper carbonate on the productivity, apparent density, and shrinking at air‐drying. It yielded an optimization of the process for the manufacturing of light, and stable/rigid insulating and thermally stable materials.",['spi']
Peri-rural Populations in Search of Territory,"In the last 30 years increasing numbers of city dwellers have chosen to go and live in the countryside. This housing migration has led to a social redefinition of country living. It has reinforced the individualisation of life styles, this contributing to a social and spatial redistribution of rural populations. Our article aims to analyse how rural residents of all origins relate to their environment and particularly to the different places they frequent. Concentrating on the material and symbolic investments made by families residing in a village located near Toulouse, we aimed to clarify the processes of territorialisation at play and this to raise a new question of the relations between city and countryside.",['shs']
Specific cationic photoinitiators for Near UV and visible LEDs: Iodonium vs. ferrocenium structures,"Two iodonium salts based on a coumarin chromophore are investigated for polymerization upon light emitting diode irradiations (LEDs). They work as one-component photoinitiators. They initiate the cationic polymerization of epoxides (under air) and vinylethers (laminate) upon exposure to violet LEDs (385 and 405 nm). Excellent polymerization profiles are recorded. Their efficiency is quite similar to that of a ferrocenium salt. Interpenetrating polymer networks can also be obtained through a concomitant cationic/radical photopolymerization of an epoxy/acrylate blend monomer. The light absorption properties of these new salts as well as the involved photochemical mechanisms are investigated for the first time through electron spin resonance, laser flash photolysis, steady state photolysis experiments. Molecular orbital calculations are also used to shed some light on the initiation mechanisms",['chim']
Peaks Over Threshold–based detector design for structural health monitoring: Application to aerospace structures,"Structural health monitoring offers new approaches to interrogate the integrity of complex structures. The structural health monitoring process classically relies on four sequential steps: damage detection, localization, classification, and quantification. The most critical step of such process is the damage detection step since it is the first one and because performances of the following steps depend on it. A common method to design such a detector consists of relying on a statistical characterization of the damage indexes available in the healthy behavior of the structure. On the basis of this information, a decision threshold can then be computed in order to achieve a desired probability of false alarm. To determine the decision threshold corresponding to such desired probability of false alarm, the approach considered here is based on a model of the tail of the damage indexes distribution built using the Peaks Over Threshold method extracted from the extreme value theory. This approach of tail distribution estimation is interesting since it is not necessary to know the whole distribution of the damage indexes to develop a detector, but only its tail. This methodology is applied here in the context of a composite aircraft nacelle (where desired probability of false alarm is typically between 1024 and 1029) for different configurations of learning sample size and probability of false alarm and is compared to a more classical one which consists of modeling the entire damage indexes distribution by means of Parzen windows. Results show that given a set of data in the healthy state, the effective probability of false alarm obtained using the Peaks Over Threshold method is closer to the desired probability of false alarm than the one obtained using the Parzen-window method, which appears to be more conservative.","['math', 'spi']"
Degradation of gaseous nitriding of steel by lubricant contamination — Effect of in-situ pre-treatments,"The present work focuses on the industrial inhibition of gaseous nitrided parts and on the industrial in-situ pre-treatment that can be used to avoid these inhibitions. The first objective is to obtain a repeatable defective nitriding process on carbon iron-based alloys, while the second is to determine the ability of determined in-situ pre-treatments to counter the previously mastered inhibition. Machining oil is used in order to obtain an industrially consistent inhibition. Its presence before chemical treatment strongly inhibits the adsorption of nitrogen atoms at the other surface, leading to heterogeneous nitriding properties of the treated samples. EDS analysis of oil residues indicates the presence of several elements, such as sulphur and carbon. As several studies already focused on the influence of sulphur on nitriding properties, experimentations on the influence of carbon are detailed. Contamination by carbon deposit leads to similar inhibition as in the case of a machining oil contamination. Literature analyses lead to the determination of three in-situ pre-treatments, namely urea (CH4N2O), pre-oxidation and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), to counter the detrimental effects such contaminations. Although all the processes enable to suppress the nitriding inhibition due to the presence of machining oil, ammonium chloride indicates the best capability to activate the adsorption of nitrogen of machining oil contaminated surfaces.","['chim', 'spi']"

Stochastically forced cardiac bidomain model,"The bidomain system of degenerate reaction–diffusion equations is a well-established spatial model of electrical activity in cardiac tissue, with “reaction” linked to the cellular action potential and “diffusion” representing current flow between cells. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a “stochastically forced” version of the bidomain model that accounts for various random effects. We establish the existence of martingale (probabilistic weak) solutions to the stochastic bidomain model. The result is proved by means of an auxiliary nondegenerate system and the Faedo–Galerkin method. To prove convergence of the approximate solutions, we use the stochastic compactness method and Skorokhod–Jakubowski a.s. representations. Finally, via a pathwise uniqueness result, we conclude that the martingale solutions are pathwise (i.e., probabilistic strong) solutions.","['sdv', 'math']"
Correlation between mechanical and microstructural properties of molybdenum nitride thin films deposited on silicon by reactive RF magnetron discharge,"Molybdenum nitride thin films were deposited on (100) silicon substrates by R.F. magnetron sputtering of a Mo target in a (Ar-N2) gas mixtures. The films were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction. The nanomechanical properties have been determined by nanoindentation and Peak-Force Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping (PF-QNM). The total internal stresses were determined by curvature measurements and the Stoney formula. As thin film composition influences the morphology, the stress state and the mechanical properties, modifications are expected in this study where the nitrogen content is tuned. The film exhibits a polycrystalline structure with preferred orientation along (111) plane. The increase of the nitrogen content in the coating (N/Mo =1.1) induces a broadening of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (111) diffraction peak, which is attributed to the presence of smaller crystallites. The residual stress and mechanical properties variation were correlated to the structural transition from γ-Mo2N to hexagonal and cubic MoN. The results show a good agreement between the nanomechanical properties obtained by nanoindentation and PF-QNM.","['spi', 'phys']"
Investigating word interactions in texts. Application to text categorization in genomics,"Words interacting in a text may be compared, to a certain extent, to molecules interacting and building “complexes”, i.e. multiwords, named entities, or longer-range semantic or syntactic associations. We will call them “k-itemsets” in the sequel, k being their interaction level. We have shown (Cadot 06) than an adequately built subset of these k-itemsets is enough for describing the entirety of the relations at work in a corpus, whatever the level k of these relations. Experimental assessment: we have shown, on a subset of 120,000 abstracts of Web of Science database in the domain of genomics that a small proportion of these itemsets suffices for discriminating with a measurable precision, fifty sub-categories of genomic research. These ones are issued from an unsupervised categorization process involving the whole 230,000 1-itemsets, i.e. individuals words.","['info', 'sdv']"

Parliamentarians' body face the virusLe corps des députés face au virus,"I propose here to present a reflection rooted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic of spring 2020. I will focus on the inclination of the French National Assembly infrastructure to be a privileged vector for the spread of the virus throughout the national territory. The reason for this is twofold: on the one hand, it is due to the historical promiscuity of the Palais Bourbon and, on the other hand, to the intense movement of political staff between Paris and the metropolitan as well as the overseas constituencies. As a result, there is a great risk that the Palais Bourbon and the 577 constituency offices could become a source of epidemic in the event of a pandemic. My argument is that the solution to this problem is not as simple as it seems, as my personal research shows that it is not possible in France to imagine a parliamentary representation at a distance, far from the Palais Bourbon and free from the physical movement of MPs. While the generalised confinement of the population in 2020 has certainly neutralised the risk, it is not a viable solution because of the exceptional regulatory regime for the National Assembly that it has induced (no regime of “hybrid procedures” has been put in place in the French Parliament, as in the United Kingdom for example). The requirement of physically embodied political representation finds a clear limit here, which will inevitably require the authorities of the National Assembly to take positions in the short and medium term.Je propose ici de présenter une réflexion ancrée dans le contexte de la pandémie de COVID-19 du printemps 2020. Mon propos concerne la propension de l’infrastructure de l’Assemblée nationale française à être un vecteur privilégié de la propagation du virus à l’échelle du territoire national. La raison est double : elle tient d’une part à la promiscuité historique qui règne au Palais Bourbon et, d’autre part, à l’intensité de la circulation du personnel politique entre Paris et les circonscriptions métropolitaines ainsi qu’ultra-marines. Ceci fait que le risque est grand en contexte pandémique de voir le Palais Bourbon et les 577 permanences en circonscription constituer des foyers d’épidémie. Mon argument consiste à dire que la solution à ce problème est moins simple qu’il n’y paraît, mes recherches personnelles montrant en effet qu’il n’est pas possible en France d’imaginer une représentation parlementaire à distance, loin du Palais Bourbon et dénuée de la circulation physique des députés. Si le confinement généralisé de la population en 2020 a certes neutralisé le risque, il ne constitue pas une solution viable du fait du régime réglementaire d’exception à l’Assemblée nationale qu’il a induit (aucun régime de « procédures hybrides » n’a été mise en place au sein du Parlement français, comme au Royaume-Uni par exemple). L’exigence d’une représentation politique physiquement incarnée trouve ici une limite franche qui nécessitera des prises de positions inévitables de la part des autorités de l’Assemblée nationale à court et à moyen terme.",['shs']
Mapping Contours of Pakistan-US Foreign Policies in the Trump Era: Narratives and Counter-NarrativesCartographie des contours des politiques étrangères pakistanaises et américaines à l'époque de Trump: récits et contre-récits,"Narratives are used by the states to create an environment in which foreign policy takes place. The US, over the years, has framed the war on terror and its relations with Pakistan in a specific way to justify its foreign policy goals. It has used coercion as well as enticements in order to force Pakistan to fulfill its foreign policy wish-list. Pakistan which has over the years been on the receiving end of these narratives has displayed unprecedented counter-narrative strategy. Applying Neoclassical Realism as a theoretical paradigm, this paper maps the continuity and change in the narrative and counter-narrative strategies of the US and Pakistan.Les récits sont utilisés par les États pour créer un environnement dans lequel la politique étrangère se déroule.

A Multidisciplinary Scientific Outreach Journal Designed for and Made by Middle and High School Students to Bring Research Closer to the Classroom,"One mission of a researcher is to share their work and results with the general public but there is a real challenge in accurately and effectively sharing scientific results with a broad audience. Indeed, they are published in scientific journals that are mostly available at high costs; the vocabulary used makes it hard for people outside of the field to understand the concepts. However, to make informed decisions on a variety of scientific and societal topics, citizens need to have access to and keep up with these research results. To build critical thinking, this good practice should be developed from an early age. This paper describes the journal DECODER (French for ""to decode""), which enables a researcher and a class to work together on their own shortened research article. The middle and high school students can have the role of active reviewers on the researcher's shortened article or they can write an outreach article on a given topic in which the researcher is a specialist. Articles are then freely available on the journal website to benefit a majority. Our partner researchers work in space agencies, in academia, or in industry, in a variety of disciplines. The emphasis is set on multidisciplinarity to raise students' awareness about research wideness and show them that research is not limited to STEAM fields but also exists in economics and humanities. This points out the significance and ubiquity of transdisciplinarity in solving real world's problems, especially for space exploration. In its first year and a half, the journal has already involved twelve classes in seven different schools and 30 articles have been submitted by 20 researchers.",['shs']
Behaviour of a Hybrid ILS Heuristic on the Capacitated Profitable Tour Problem,"In the present paper, we study the behaviour of a hybrid Iterative Local Search heuristic (ILS). A Large Neighborhood Search heuristic (LNS) and a Variable Neighborhood Descent with Random neighborhood ordering (RVND) are used in the local search phase of the proposed ILS. The approach is evaluated on a well-known variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) called Capacitated Profitable Tour Problem (CPTP). In this variant, the vehicles are no longer required to visit all the customers. However, a specific profit is obtained each time a customer is visited. The goal of the CPTP is to design routes with maximum difference between collected profits and routing costs, which satisfy the capacity constraint of the vehicles. The experimental study consists in comparing different combinations of ILS, LNS and RVND. The computational results show that the hybridization of the three heuristics leads to better solutions. Furthermore, comparisons with a Variable Neighborhood Search and two Tabu Searches from the literature indicates that our hybrid approach is competitive",['info']
A selective adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the profitable tour problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery services,"The Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickups and Deliveries (VRPSPD) is a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem. In this variant, an unlimited fleet of capacitated vehicles is used to satisfy both pickup and delivery demands of each customer simultaneously. In many practical situations, such a fleet is costly. The present study extends the VRPSPD by assuming a fixed number of vehicles when the constraint of visiting all customers is relaxed. More specifically, profits are assigned to the customers with the goal of maximizing the difference between collected profits and routing costs. This variant is named Profitable Tour Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery services (PTPSPD). We present a mathematical model run with the CPLEX solver. We also present an extension of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search heuristic (ALNS) called selective ALNS (sALNS). sALNS uses a new operator selection that executes two phases alternately: the random and the score-dependent phases. An appropriate update of scores is employed. Furthermore, sALNS explores missed regions of the search space by evaluating solutions after the destruction step. Finally, we give tuned insertion and removal operators that handle the constraints of the PTPSPD, as well as a new update of temperature, that helps avoiding local optima, in the Simulated Annealing embedded in sALNS. sALNS is evaluated on 117 new instances with 50–199 customers. A comparison is made between the components of sALNS, the classical ALNS and a recent ALNS heuristic from the literature. sALNS is also evaluated on some VRPSPD instances from the literature. The computational results show that our heuristic provides good quality solutions in reasonable computing time.",['info']
Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed fleet of conventional and heterogeneous electric vehicles and time dependent charging costs,"n this paper, we consider the vehicle routing problem with mixed fleet of conventional and heterogenous electric vehicles and time dependent charging costs, denoted VRP-HFCC, in which a set of geographically scattered customers have to be served by a mixed fleet of vehicles composed of a heterogenous fleet of Electric Vehicles (EVs), having different battery capacities and operating costs, and Conventional Vehicles (CVs). We include the possibility of charging EVs in the available charging stations during the routes in order to serve all customers. Each charging station offers charging service with a known technology of chargers and time dependent charging costs. Charging stations are also subject to operating time windows constraints. EVs are not necessarily compatible with all available charging technologies and a partial charging is allowed. Intermittent charging at the depot is also allowed provided that constraints related to the electricity grid are satisfied. The objective is to minimize the number of employed vehicles and then minimize the total travel and charging costs. In this study, we present a Mixed Integer Programming Model and develop a Charging Routing Heuristic and a Local Search Heuristic based on the Inject-Eject routine with different insertion methods. All heuristics are tested on real data instances.",['info']

"Physical, Thermal and Spectroscopical Characterization of Biofield Treated Triphenylmethane: An Impact of Biofield Treatment","Triphenylmethane is a synthetic dye used as antimicrobial agent and for the chemical visualization in thin layer chromatography of higher fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and aliphatic amines. The present study was an attempt to investigate the impact of biofield treatment on physical, thermal and spectroscopical charecteristics of triphenylmethane. The study was performed in two groups i.e., control and treatment. The treatment group subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. The control and treated groups of triphenylmethane samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyzer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). XRD study revealed decreases in average crystallite size (14.22%) of treated triphenylmethane as compared to control sample. Surface area analysis showed a slight increase (0.42%) in surface area of treated sample with respect to control. DSC thermogram of treated triphenylmethane showed the slight increase in melting point and latent heat of fusion with respect to control. TGA analysis of control triphenylmethane showed weight loss by 45.99% and treated sample showed weight loss by 64.40%. The Tmax was also decreased by 7.17% in treated sample as compared to control. The FT-IR and UV spectroscopic result showed the similar pattern of spectra. The GC-MS analysis suggested a significant decrease in carbon isotopic abundance (expressed in δ13C, ‰) in treated sample (about 380 to 524‰) as compared to control. Based on these results, it is found that biofield treatment has the impact on physical, thermal and carbon isotopic abundance of treated triphenylmethane with respect to control.",['chim']
Spectroscopic Characterization of Disodium Hydrogen Orthophosphate and Sodium Nitrate after Biofield Treatment,"Disodium hydrogen orthophosphate is a water soluble white powder widely used as pH regulator and saline laxative. The sodium nitrate is a highly water soluble white solid, used in high blood pressure, dentinal hypersensitivity, and production of fertilizers. The present study was aimed to investigate the impact of biofield treatment on spectral properties of disodium hydrogen orthophosphate and sodium nitrate. The study was performed in two groups i.e., control and treatment of each compound. The treatment groups were subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. The spectral properties of control and treated groups of both compounds were studied using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic techniques. FT-IR spectrum of biofield treated disodium hydrogen orthophosphate showed the shifting in wavenumber of vibrational peaks (with respect to control) corresponding to O-H stretching from 2975 to 3357 cm-1, PO-H symmetrical stretching from 2359 to 2350 cm-1, O=P-OH deformation from 1717-1796 cm-1 to 1701-1735 cm-1, P=O asymmetric stretching from 1356 to 1260 cm-1 and P=O symmetric stretching from 1159 to 1132 cm-1, etc. Likewise, the FT-IR spectrum of sodium nitrate exhibited the shifting of vibrational frequency of N=O stretching from 1788 to 1648 cm-1 and NO3 asymmetric and symmetric stretchings from 1369 to 1381 cm-1 and 1340 to 1267 cm-1. UV spectrum of treated disodium hydrogen orthophosphate revealed a negative absorbance; it may be due to decrease in UV absorbance as compared to control. UV spectrum of control sodium nitrate exhibited two absorbance maxima (λmax) at 239.4 nm and 341.4 nm, which were altered to one absorbance maxima (λmax) at 209.2 nm after biofield treatment. Overall, the FT-IR and UV spectroscopic data of both compounds suggest an impact of biofield treatment on spectral properties with respect to force constant, bond strength, dipole moments and transition energy between two orbitals (ground state and excited state) as compared to respective control.",['chim']
Investigation of Isotopic Abundance Ratio of Biofield Treated Phenol Derivatives Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,"Butylatedhydroxytoluene (BHT) and 4-methoxyphenol (4-MP) are phenol derivatives that are generally known for their antioxidant properties and depigmenting activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on the isotopic abundance in BHT and 4-MP using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). BHT and 4-MP samples were divided into two parts: control and treated. The control group remained untreated while the treated group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Control and treated samples were characterized using GC-MS. The GC-MS data revealed that the isotopic abundance ratio of 13C/12C or 2H/1H (PM+1)/PM and 18O/16O (PM+2)/PM increased significantly in treated BHT and 4-MP (where PM- primary molecule, PM+1- isotopic molecule either for 13C or 2H and PM+2 is the isotopic molecule for 18O). The isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+1)/PM in the treated BHT and 4-MP was increased up to 181.27% and 380.73% respectively as compared to their respective control. Moreover, the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+2)/PM in the treated BHT and 4-MP increased up to 185.99% and 355.33% respectively. GC-MS data suggests that the biofield treatment significantly increased the isotopic abundance of 2H, 13C and 18O in the treated BHT and 4-MP as compared to the control.",['sdv']
Parareal in time 3D numerical solver for the LWR Benchmark neutron diffusion transient model,"Abstract In this paper we present a time-parallel algorithm for the 3D neutrons calculation of a transient model in a nuclear reactor core. The neutrons calculation consists in numerically solving the time dependent diffusion approximation equation, which is a simplified transport equation. The numerical resolution is done with finite elements method based on a tetrahedral meshing of the computational domain, representing the reactor core, and time discretization is achieved using a θ-scheme. The transient model presents moving control rods during the time of the reaction. Therefore, cross-sections (piecewise constants) are taken into account by interpolations with respect to the velocity of the control rods. The parallelism across the time is achieved by an adequate use of the parareal in time algorithm to the handled problem. This parallel method is a predictor corrector scheme that iteratively combines the use of two kinds of numerical propagators, one coarse and one fine. Our method is made efficient by means of a coarse solver defined with large time step and fixed position control rods model, while the fine propagator is assumed to be a high order numerical approximation of the full model. The parallel implementation of our method provides a good scalability of the algorithm. Numerical results show the efficiency of the parareal method on large light water reactor transient model corresponding to the Langenbuch–Maurer–Werner benchmark.",['math']
Guiding Principles in Setting Cartel Sanctions,"Nous discutons les enjeux et embûches théoriques et empiriques auxquels les autorités de concurrence et les tribunaux font face pour sanctionner les cartels, à savoir la probabilité de détection, la dynamique de cartel, la durée de l’impact et le surprix.",['shs']
Effect of mean shear stress on the fatigue strength of notched components under multiaxial stress state,"The effect of a static and intermittent shear stress on the HCF strength of two quenched and tempered steel grades used to produce shafts in crane industry was studied on notched specimens (Kt=1.7 and 2.7) for being representative of critical areas. Three main load cases were considered: C1=rotative bending (RB), C2=RB and static torsion and C3=RB and mean torsion fluctuating in blocks to simulated start and stop cycles. In this last case the first investigated mean shear stress, τm, was equal to the material yield stress in pure shear, τy. Additional C3 variants were investigated too where τm was equal to 0.3τy and 0.7τy. It has been shown that τm has little effect on the rotating bending HCF strength at 3×106 cycles. For both steel grades and notch geometries studied, the results of the fatigue tests confirm that the influence of a static torsion on the rotating bending HCF strength is negligible even when the static torsion level is equivalent to the yield strength of the material in torsion. However, in intermittent service conditions (C3), it has been shown that torsion cycles can affect significantly the HCF strength in RB, depending on the notch acuity and torsion level. Elastic-plastic cyclic FEA has been done for the two specimen geometries to assess the stabilized stress-strain state at the notch root and then to compute the fatigue life by using the multiaxial HCF life models proposed by: Fatemi-Socie, Smith-Watson-Topper, and Wang-Brown. The Palmgreen-Miner hypothesis was used to cumulate damage mainly because of its simplicity for design purposes. According to our simulations and with the chosen cumulative damage rule, none of the tested fatigue life calculation methods give good results for all the load cases. The efficiency of the tested methods is very dependent on both the material and the load cases. However, the Smith-Watson-Topper approach gives the best results whereas the Fatemi-Socie models leads to the more conservative ones except in one load case",['spi']
Integration of concept maturity in decision-making for engineering design: An application to a solar collector development,"The presence of immature concepts makes decision-making difficult in upstream phases of a development project. A company’s enthusiasm to improve product performance by exploring novel concepts is hampered by a low maturity that results in an inherent risk of cost overruns and schedule delays. Besides this, decisions taken during conceptual design phases have a critical impact on product life cycle cost. In this context, a useful practice is to develop two or more concepts in parallel and delay decision-making until sufficient knowledge is generated. Even so, a preliminary screening of concepts is usually needed because of the substantial resources and time required for the development activities. In this paper, a concept screening approach is proposed at the conceptual design phase on the basis of two metrics. The first assesses risk related to the non-completion of design criteria while respecting available time (consideration of deadline) and company resources. The second metric assesses the expected performance of novel concepts compared with the existing products. It uses preference functions and generalized ordered weighted averaging (GOWA) operators. Fuzzy logic tools are used in the two metrics to capture and propagate imprecision in the description of design and external environment. In order to prove its value, the proposed approach was applied to the development of a solar collector in an industrial environment.",['spi']
Reducing Environmental Impacts of Aluminium Cable Recycling Process with Life Cycle Assessment Methodology,"Life cycle impact of European generic primary and secondary aluminium are well defined. However specific recycling processes are not available in literature. In this study, the environmental assessment of cable recycling processing is examined using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The data come from a recycling plant (MTB Recycling) in France. MTB process relies only on mechanical separation and optical sorting processes on shredder cables. The LCA results demonstrate huge environmental benefits for aluminium recycled in comparison with primary aluminium. This work was done firstly to document specific environmental impact of MTB recycling process in comparison with traditional aluminium recycling smelting. Secondly, to provide an environmental overview of the process steps in order to reduce the environmental impact of this recycling pathway. Using the identified hotspots from the LCA for the MTB specific recycling process for aluminium cables, we were able to provide help for designers to carry on reducing the environmental impact of the technologies used during the recycling pathway. This paper focuses on LCA results and implementations on the process for reducing the environmental impact.","['sde', 'spi']"
Large-scale 3D printing of ultra-high performance concrete – a new processing route for architects and builders,"In the present paper a new additive manufacturing processing route is introduced for ultra-high performance concrete. Interdisciplinary work involving materials science, computation, robotics, architecture and design resulted in the development of an innovative way of 3D printing cementitious materials. The 3D printing process involved is based on a FDM-like technique, in the sense that a material is deposited layer by layer through an extrusion printhead mounted on a 6-axis robotic arm. The mechanical properties of 3D printed materials are assessed. The proposed technology succeeds in solving many of the problems that can be found in the literature. Most notably, this process allows the production of 3D large-scale complex geometries, without the use of temporary supports, as opposed to 2.5D examples found in the literature for concrete 3D printing. Architectural cases of application are used as examples in order to demonstrate the potentialities of the technology. Two structural elements were produced and constitute some of the largest 3D printed concrete parts available until now. Multi-functionality was enabled for both structural elements by taking advantage of the complex geometry which can be achieved using our technology for large-scale additive manufacturing.","['chim', 'math', 'info', 'spi', 'phys']"
Energy efficiency optimization of engine by frictional reduction of functional surfaces of cylinder ring-pack system,"Friction reduction, lower oil consumption, and limitation of greenhouse gases emissions are the chief objectives of the automotive industry in order to improve the environmental efficiency of vehicle engines. In this paper, a strategy for ring-pack friction reduction through cylinder liner finish optimization based on coupling instrumented honing experiments and numerical prediction of elastohydrodynamic friction is proposed. The results show that honed surfaces produced by fine abrasion by honing stones yield the optimal elastohydrodynamic friction.

Scaling invariance of fatigue crack growth in gigacycle loading regime,"The role of the collective behavior of defect ensembles at the crack tip and the laws of fatigue crack propagation in R4 high-strength steel have been studied under conditions of symmetric tension-compression gigacycle loading at 20 kHz.

The Usability of Speech and/or Gestures in Multi-Modal Interface Systems,"Multi-Modal Interface Systems (MMIS) have proliferated in the last few decades, since they provide a direct interface for both Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and face-to-face communication. Our aim is to provide users without any prior 3D modelling experience, with a multi-modal interface to create a 3D object. The system also incorporates help throughout the drawing process and identifies simple words and gestures to accomplish a range of (simple to complex) modeling tasks. We have developed a multi-modal interface that allows users to design objects in 3D, using AutoCAD commands as well as speech and gesture. We have used a microphone to collect speech input and a Leap Motion sensor to collect gesture input in real time. Two sets of experiments were conducted to investigate the usability of the system and evaluate the system performance using Leap Motion versus keyboard and mouse. Our results indicate that performing a task using speech is perceived exhausting, when there is no shared vocabulary between man and machine, and the usability of traditional input devices supersedes the usability of speech and gestures. Only a small ratio of participants, less than 7% in our experiments were able to carry out the tasks with appropriate precision.",['info']
Investigations on the flank wear and modelling of the contact radius effect in turning of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy,"Machining of difficult-to-cut materials like Ti6Al4V titanium alloy leads to significant flank wear on the cutting tool. In order to ensure the respect of final part specifications, flank wear has to be controlled. In literature, predictive models had been developed. However, these models can be enhanced by taking into account new parameters depending on the part geometry. This study deals with the analysis of the contact radius effect on flank wear. Results highlight that the contact radius favors the flank wear. Afterwards, a phenomenological model is proposed and improves flank wear modelling.",['spi']

Validation and verification of FE models of piezo based SHM systems,"The idea of generating and sensing Lamb waves through piezoelectric sensor/actuator configurations is common for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications. Methods using time of flight analysis require the prediction of the first incoming waves. Computations on small periodic patterns are shown to be usable to determine which waves will actually be relevant. For the considered applications, these are the first membrane waves propagating at fairly high speeds. Parametric FEM computations are then used to analyze important parameters (mesh size, time step, damping) and it is shown that accurate predictions can be obtained in a few CPU minutes.",['spi']
Elasto-plastic strain field measurement at micro-scale on 316L stainless steel,"This study deals with the characterisation of the mechanical behaviour of an austenitic stainless steel (316L) at the micrometric scale in its elasto-plastic domain. For that, the full-field “grid method”, adapted to this scale, is implemented. The direct interferometric photolithography is used here to produce gratings (the pitch is approximately 5 μm) on specimen surface. The gratings are digitized at every step of the tensile loading thanks to a white-light interferometric microscope. The in-plan strain fields are then deduced from these grating images (resolution is closed to 2×10-3 for a spatial resolution of bout 20 μm). The results show that the strain localisation is in accordance with the microstructure. Some considerations about the average strain within different grains of the steel sample are made to show how the plastic deformation begins locally before the global yield point σY. It was then observed that these local σY values thus determined may vary by +/-20 MPa around the macroscopic value (180 MPa).",['spi']

A material model describing an elasto-viscoplastic behaviour with anisotropy effect has been identified and implemented in ABAQUS using Fortran subroutine. The numerical model is validated by comparing experiments and numerical results in terms of deformed shapes and an improved forming cycle is suggested.",['spi']
"Influence of vanadium on structure, mechanical and tribological properties of CrN coatings","This work aims to show the characterisation of Cr–V–N coatings, with the varied amounts of Cr and V. CrN, VN and Cr–V–N coatings were deposited onto silicon and XC100 steel substrates by reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering and characterised with X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nanoindentation, pin on disc tribological tests and scratch tests. The residual stress was calculated using the Stoney formula. Compared to the CrN system, the Cr–V–N films presented a rough surface based on pyramidal morphology. A hardness of 19?53 GPa and a friction coefficient of 0?55 were obtained for CrN; in contrast, Cr–V–N coatings presented a weak hardness of 6?23 GPa. In the case of wear against a 100Cr6 ball, the Cr–V–N films were completely removed from the substrate, even though the Cr–V–N coating presented a low friction coefficient (0?39). However, the VN film showed good tribological performance.",['spi']
Design for Additive Manufacturing : Supporting Intrinsic-Motivated Creativity,"Emotional aspects and designers’ motivations in Design For Additive Manufacturing are rarely studied. Still, as they can influence creative behaviors, it is worth of interest to draw some bases for a relation between designers’ motivations and the field of Additive Manufacturing. This paper aims at identifying the motivations that push designers to deal with AM in their practice. We have highlighted that they experience some extrinsic motivations: technical improvements, economics and social environments pressures. We also notice that creative designers, apart from AM, usually experience some intrinsic motivations and, moreover, that it exists an ideal state to generate creative concepts: the Flow. To support creative designers in DFAM in reaching the Flow, we then identified 4 key levers through the potential of AM: the newness of AM processes, the needed skill of 3D modelling, the investigation of new shape grammars and finally the opportunity of embodying concepts into physical objects. To benefit from this potential, we assume that designers’ intrinsic motivations should be supported: we identified three required conditions. The first one is the use of a proper vocabulary i.e the expression Additive Manufacturing instead of 3D Printing. The second one is the development of a design process which integrates a creative approach. The third condition is the use of AM objects as experience triggers during creative sessions to arise positive emotions.",['spi']
Investigation of process parameter effect on anisotropic properties of 3D printed sand molds,"The development of sand mold three-dimensional printing technologies enables the manufacturing of molds without the use of a physical model. However, the effects of the three-dimensional printing process parameters on the mold permeability and strength are not well known, leading the industries to keep old settings until castings have recurring defects. In the present work, the influence of these parameters was experimentally investigated to understand their effect on the mold strength and permeability. Cylindrical and barshaped test specimens were printed to perform, respectively, permeability and bending strength measurements. Experiments were designed to statistically quantify the individual and combined effect of these process parameters. While the binder quantity only affects the mold strength, increasing the recoater speed leads to both greater permeability and reduced strength due to the reduced sand compaction. Recommendations for optimizing some 3D printer settings are proposed to attain predefined mold properties and minimize the anisotropic behavior of the sand mold in regard to both the orientation and the position in the job box.",['spi']

Tailoring residual stress profile of Selective Laser Melted parts by Laser Shock Peening,"The paper describes a new approach in controlling and tailoring residual stress profile of parts made by Selective Laser Melting (SLM). SLM parts are well known for the high tensile stresses in the as – built state in the surface or subsurface region. These stresses have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties and especially on the fatigue life. Laser Shock Peening (LSP) as a surface treatment method was applied on SLM parts and residual stress measurements with the hole – drilling method were performed. Two different grades of stainless steel were used: a martensitic 15-5 precipitation hardenable PH1 and an austenitic 316L. Different LSP parameters were used, varying laser energy, shot overlap, laser spot size and treatments with and without an ablative medium. For both materials the as-built (AB) residual stress state was changed to a more beneficial compressive state. The value and the depth of the compressive stress was analyzed and showed a clear dependence on the LSP processing parameters. Application of LSP on SLM parts showed promising results, and a novel method that would combine these two processes is proposed. The use of LSP during the building phase of SLM as a “3D LSP” method would possibly give the advantage of further increasing the depth and volume of compressive residual stresses, and selectively treating key areas of the part, thereby further increasing fatigue life.",['spi']
Orthogonal cutting simulation of OFHC copper using a new constitutive model considering the state of stress and the microstructure effects,"This work aims to develop an orthogonal cutting model for surface integrity prediction, which incorporates a new constitutive model of Oxygen Free High Conductivity (OFHC) copper. It accounts for the effects of the state of stress on the flow stress evolution up to fracture. Moreover, since surface integrity parameters are sensitive to the microstructure of the work material, this constitutive model highlights also the recrystallization effects on the flow stress. Orthogonal cutting model is validated using experimental designed cutting tests. More accurate predictions were obtained using this new constitutive model comparing to the classical Johnson-Cook model.",['spi']
Use of FEM models to study fatigue of overhead contact wires,"Fatigue cracks can induce fracture of the catenary Contact Wire (CW) and thus huge costs for the operator. Nowadays the wear criterion to replace the CW leads to lifespan over than 50 years, and the catenary can see a very high number of cycles so that fatigue life must be taken into account. A full process to compute the multiaxial transient stress field in the CW has been developed. A fatigue criticality indicator to assess the risk of crack initiation was introduced. This elaborate indicator is used to validate a simplified fatigue indicator based on the uniaxial Euler-Bernoulli beam stresses that are much faster to compute. This indicator is then used to assess parameters influencing the risk of fatigue in the case of junction claws.",['spi']
Impact of copper nanoparticles on porcine neutrophils: Proposition of an ultrasensitive characterization factor using chemiluminescence information and USEtox assessment model,"There is a need by the European Commission (EC) regulations, as well as others, to reduce the in vivo toxicity tests made on animals. Conventional in vitro tests were designed for non-nanoparticle sized entities, and therefore do not necessarily assess the adverse impacts of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) on humans. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a widely used methodology for evaluating the environmental performance of products. Nevertheless, the application of LCA on ENPs is difficult because the characterization factors (CFs) of ENPs, as significant input parameters in LCA, remain a major unknown. It is a premise of this study to monitor the chemiluminescence (CL) spectra resulting from the reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger made from the presence of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) to porcine neutrophils in vitro, thereby enabling to calculate the porcine and human toxicity CFs. The framework of a scientific consensus model, USEtox model, is selected and the midpoint of CF is set as the inflammation of pig or human. Finally, the present study recommends human and porcine inflammation CFs of CuNPs in Europe to be 1.07 and 2.90 CTU (comparative toxic units) respectively.","['sdv', 'sde']"

Flexural Experimental Analysis Coupled To An Acoustic Emission Study Of A Curved Sandwich Structures Made By Filament Winding Process,"Composite sandwich structures studied in this paper were developed for a cylindrical tanks of vacuum vehicles using glass-fiber/vinylester composite facing and different types of foam cores like PET, PU and 3D woven Fabrics. The main objective of a designer is to choose the appropriate materials constituting the structure and determine the respective thicknesses of skins and foam in order to resist to bending moment, shear and axial stresses induced by forces applied to the material components. Generally, their study is based on the sandwich theory and the selection of materials having the appropriate properties, depending on its application. The work presented in this paper aims to characterize some of these lightweight structures in three and four points bending, followed simultaneously by acoustic emission control study to provide additional expertise elements. Finally, a failure analysis of sandwich structures is made to identify the different cracking modes of the different candidate materials.",['spi']
Competition between surface defects and residual stresses on fatigue behaviour of shot peened forged components,"The present study focuses on analysing and modelling the influence on fatigue behaviour of the surface of a hot-forged C70 connecting rod which undergoes a shot-blasting treatment. The shot-blasting heavily affects the surface and thus the fatigue properties. In addition, the forging process induces large defects which also have an effect on the fatigue strength. So as to be able to determine which aspects of the surface integrity are the most influential in fatigue, various surface states were thoroughly characterised and then tested in high cycle fatigue in bending. The various aspects studied are the surface roughness and large defects, residual stresses, microstructure and hardness. The aim of this work is to develop a fatigue design approach that can take into account both the effect of the surface defects and that of the residual stresses on fatigue.",['spi']

A NURBS-BASED TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION METHOD INCLUDING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING CONSTRAINTS,"In this work, the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) topology optimization (TO) method is revisited and reformulated within the mathematical framework of NURBS functions. This implies several advantages: firstly, a NURBS surface allows exploiting an implicitly defined filter zone; secondly, the number of optimization variables (i.e. the parameters defining the NURBS surface) is relatively small when compared to the classical SIMP approach. Finally the TO can be carried out by including non-linearity (either geometric or material) or non-conventional manufacturing constraints, as those related to the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology. In this work the TO is applied to a standard benchmark.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
Multi-scale characterisation of material properties of composite fabrics through modal testsCaractérisation multi-échelle des propriétés matériaux de tissus composites par mesures vibratoires,"One of the main issues of composite materials is related to the difficulty of characterising the material properties at mesoscopic and microscopic scales. Classical mechanical tests are not able to provide the full set of 3D properties : these tests can provide only the in-plane elastic properties of the constitutive lamina. Therefore, to go beyond the main restrictions imposed by standard destructive tests, this work deals with the problem of characterising the material properties of a multilayer composite plate, through a non-destructive modal test performed at the macro-scale : a multi-scale identification strategy (MSIS) is proposed. The MSIS aims at identifying the constitutive properties by exploiting the information restrained in the composite macroscopic dynamical response. The MSIS relies on the strain energy homogenisation technique of periodic media and on a gradient-based algorithm to perform the solution search. The identification problem is stated as a constrained inverse problem, where the objective function depends upon both experimental and numerical natural frequencies of the specimen. In this background, the optimisation variables are both geometrical and material properties of the constitutive phases composing the representative volume element. The effectiveness of the approach will be proven through a campaign of tests conducted on multilayer composites.L’inconvénient principal des méthodes de caractérisation classiques est lié à l’impossibilité de pouvoir déterminer les constantes techniques d’élasticité dans le cas 3D : avec les essais classiques il est possible de déterminer les propriétés élastiques dans le plan du pli constitutif et avoir des valeurs approximées vis-à-vis des modules de cisaillement transverse. Aucune information ne peut être déduite sur les propriétés des phases constitutives à l’échelle microscopique. Pour contourner les restrictions propres aux essais de caractérisation standard, on propose une stratégie d’identification multi-échelle (MSIS, multi-scale identification strategy) permettant d’évaluer les propriétés matériaux à toute échelle caractéristique du problème sur la base d’essais non-destructifs effectués à l’échelle macroscopique. La méthode MSIS s’appuie d’une part sur une technique d’homogénéisation numérique et d’autre sur l’utilisation d’un algorithme au gradient pour résoudre le problème d’optimisation associé. Le problème est formulé comme un problème de minimisation sous contrainte : l’idée est celle de minimiser l’écart entre la réponse dynamique « numérique » (dépendant des propriétés du matériau aux échelles inférieures) et celle expérimentale tout en respectant les contraintes d’existence du tenseur de rigidité des phases constitutives à l’échelle microscopique. L’efficacité de la méthode sera prouvée à travers une campagne d’essais faites sur composites à renfort unidirectionnel.",['spi']
Transformable product formal definition with its implementation in CAD tools,"Nowadays products extend their capabilities towards changing their configurations in order to cover multiple usage needs. They may be named transformable products and have not been taken into consideration in early design stages yet. In this paper, a proactive definition of the product is provided with transformation intrinsic properties. The formalization leads to an architecture. This enables developing a transformable product from two ordinary non-evolving objects. Different configurations and transformation processes have been set and implemented within a CAD tool to design a transformable product. A new paradigm is thus initiated, which will lead to efficient and dynamic design of transformable product.",['spi']
Fatigue crack initiation and growth on an extruded titanium alloy in gigacycle regime: comparison between tension and torsion loadings,"This paper is focused on the analysis of fatigue crack initiation and growth mechanisms in defect free VT3-1 titanium alloy (similar to Ti6Al4V) in VHCF regime under tensile and torsion loadings. Fully reversed fatigue tests were carried out between 107 and 109 cycles at 20 kHz under constant amplitude loadings (no pulse-pause). SEM observations of the specimens fracture surfaces were carried out in order to compare the crack initiation mechanisms and the different crack growth stages under different loadings. It has been shown that subsurface crack initiation may appear under tension (as usual in gigacycle regime) but in our experiments no inclusion was observed in the “fish-eye”. Furthermore, subsurface crack initiation was observed under torsion loading too, despite the maximum shear stress location at the specimen surface. Under this loading, a “fish-eye” was observed too, but again without any inclusion in its center. The suspected microstructural reasons responsible for subsurface crack initiations under torsion loading could not be observed due to significant destruction of the fracture patterns (crack lips friction under mixed mode). The results of the fatigue tests show a principal difference in crack initiation and early crack growth stage between tensile and torsion loadings. Torsion crack initiates on a plane of maximum shear stress (like in HCF regime) while tensile crack is on a plane of maximum normal stress. Sequences of changes in fracture surface roughness is the same for tensile and torsion loadings.",['spi']

Stress distribution correlated with damage in duplex stainless steel studied by synchrotron diffraction during plastic necking,"The goal of this work was the determination of lattice strains distribution in two phases of duplex steel during plastic necking. Subsequently, the stress heterogeneity in the neck was studied in order to determine the reason for the damage initiation and to verify the hypothesis that the damage begins in the ferritic phase. To do this, X-ray synchrotron radiation was used to scan the ‘in situ’ variation of the interplanar spacings along the necking zone for samples subjected to tensile loading. A self-consistent model and FEM simulation were applied for the experimental data interpretation. It was found that for advanced necking the phase lattice strains, especially those measured at some distance from the neck centre, show a large inversion of the loads localised in both phases compared to the undamaged state (the lattice strains in the ferrite become smaller than in the austenite). This effect indicates stress relaxation in the ferrite which is connected with the damage phenomenon. Correlation of the experimental results with the modelling shows that the value of von Mises stress is responsible for the initiation of the ferritic phase softening.",['spi']
Effects of small particles on the mechanical behavior and on the local damage of highly filled elastomers,"The mechanical behavior and damage of highly filled elastomers such as propellants is studied experimentally. A model material made of a polyacrylate matrix filled with glass beads and energetic binders filled with ammonium perchlorate and HMX have been formulated. The focus is on materials containing micrometric size particles. The size of fillers was varied from a few microns to hundreds of microns in order to study the impact of the size of particles. The materials stress-strain responses and the volume changes during uniaxial tensile tests have been recorded. Microtomographic slices of strained samples have been obtained in order to look at the type of damage sustained by the acrylate/glass bead materials. It appears that in the presence of large particles, composites showing early prominent crack benefits from the addition of small particles, whereas composites showing well dispersed matrix/particle decohesion without large cracks show no change of behavior when small particles are added.",['spi']
A new multi-scale optimisation strategy for designing variable angle tow composites by integrating manufacturing constraints,"In this work a multi-scale two-level (MS2L) optimisation strategy for optimising variable angle tow (VAT) composites is presented. In the framework of the MS2L methodology [1], [2], [3] the design problem is split and solved into two steps. At the first step the goal is to determine the optimum distribution of the laminate stiffness properties over the structure (macroscopic scale), while the second step aims at retrieving the optimum fibres-path in each layer meeting all the requirements provided by the problem at hand (mesoscopic scale). The MS2L design strategy is characterised on the one hand by the refusal of simplifying hypotheses and classical rules usually employed in the framework of the design process of laminates, and on the other hand by a proper and complete mathematical formalisation of the optimum design problem at each characteristic scale (meso-macro). The MS2L strategy relies on the use of the polar formalism (extended to the case of higher-order theories [4], [5]) for the description of the anisotropic behaviour of the composite. The real advantage in using the Verchery's polar method is in the fact that the elastic response of the structure at the macro-scale is described in terms of tensor invariants, the so-called polar parameters, having a precise physical meaning (which is linked to the elastic symmetries of the material) [4]. On the other hand the MS2L strategy relies on the use of a particular genetic algorithm (GA) able to deal with a special class of huge-size optimisation problems (from hundreds to thousands of design variables) defined over a domain of variable dimension, i.e. optimisation problems involving a variable number of design variables [6]. The MS2L strategy has been improved in order to integrate all types of requirements (mechanical, manufacturability, geometric, etc.) within the first-level problem [3]. Several modifications have been introduced in the theoretical and numerical framework of the MS2L design procedure at both first and second levels [2], [3]. At the first level (laminate macroscopic scale) of the procedure, where the VAT laminate is modelled as an equivalent homogeneous anisotropic plate whose mechanical behaviour is described in terms of polar parameters (which vary locally over the structure), the major modifications focus on: 1) the utilisation of higher-order theories (First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) framework [4], [5] for taking into account the influence of the transverse shear stiffness on the overall mechanical response of VAT composites; 2) the utilisation of B-spline surfaces for obtaining a continuous point-wise variation of the laminate polar parameters; 3) a proper mathematical formalisation of the manufacturability constraints linked to the AFP process in the framework of the B-spline representation and in terms of laminate polar parameters. Regarding the second-level problem (laminate mesoscopic scale, i.e. the ply level) the main modifications is the utilisation of B-spline surfaces for obtaining a continuous point-wise variation of the fibres-path within each ply. Accordingly, the second-level problem (the lay-up design) can now be formulated as an unconstrained minimisation problem as all the requirements (geometrical, technological, mechanical, etc.) are satisfied since the first step of the MS2L strategy. All of these modifications imply several advantages for the resolution of the related optimisation problems (both at first and second level of the strategy) as detailed in [3]. The effectiveness of the MS2L strategy is proven through a numerical example on the maximisation of the first buckling factor of a VAT plate subject to both mechanical and manufacturability constraints.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
Fatigue Life of a SG Cast Iron under Real Loading Spectra: Effect of the Correlation Factor Between Bending and Torsion,"This paper deals with the effect on life of the desynchronism between two variable amplitude load sequences in combined bending and torsion. Experiments were carried out on smooth specimens made of the EN-GJS800-2 cast iron. The comparison between experimental lives and predicted ones with the following fatigue life calculation methods is presented: Smith-Watson-Topper, Fatemi and Socie (method proposed by Bannantine), Wang and Brown, Socie's proposal for high cycle fatigue, and Morel. If the scatter of experiments is considered, these experiments show a low effect of the correlation factor on life. All the simulated fatigue life calculation methods give good results for proportional loads, but their predictions are not good for non-proportional loads. Morel’s proposal seems to be the best to predict life of the tested material with our non-proportional fatigue test conditions.",['spi']
High Cycle Fatigue Strength of Punched Thin Fe-Si Steel Sheets,"Some parts of electrical machines are built from stacks of thin steel sheets, for which the coarse grain microstructure allows for minimizing magnetic losses. The fabrication process of these parts usually involves punching operations that generate important defects on the edges. Since these alterations may result in a degradation of the fatigue strength, this study aims at elaborating on a fatigue design strategy for such punched parts. To reach this objective, high cycle fatigue tests are performed on different specimens with either punched or polished edges. The results show a significant decrease of the fatigue strength for punched specimens. Scanning electron microscope observations of specimen facture surfaces reveal that defects on punched edges are at the origin of the fatigue cracks. The influence of temperature is also investigated. Fatigue tests are performed at ambient temperature (20°C) and at 180°C. According to the experimental results, no significant influence on the median fatigue strength is observed. Since crack initiation always occur on the edges, additional investigations are performed to characterize how edges are altered by punching operations. Residual stresses are determined on punched edges using x-ray diffraction techniques. As a consequence of punching, important tensile residual stresses exist along the loading direction. In association with the stress concentration caused by geometrical defects, residual stresses promote crack initiation and fast crack propagation. For a better understanding of crack initiation, edge geometries are scanned with a 3D optical profilometer, allowing us to identify the critical defect. It is found that the typical defect size is comparable to the grain size.",['spi']
Thixoforging of low carbon steel SAE1006 backward Thixoextrusion,"For nearly two decades, researchers from academia and industry are working on the development of steel alloys thixoforging, which are not the easiest to form with this process. The early fundamental technology research demonstrated the feasibility for certain conditions. These works has focused on different steel grades, e.g. C38, M2…; different tools and their materials due to specific thermal and mechanical properties; better forming conditions; flow of the semisolid material; characteristics and the means of obtaining the semisolid state; evolution of the liquid fraction; mechanical models of deformation, process simulation, etc. Today, it is necessary to continue the development by realizing technological demonstrators integrating some industrial constraints, like production rate and costs, but it is also necessary to identify and define the field of application of this process and its limits in terms of materials, tools, cadence, forming speed, etc. The major difficulties are the interactions and the coupling of these various parameters and conditions of this forming process making it difficult to understand the mechanisms of thixoforging. In this context, a new steel grade was tested and studied. This SAE 1006 grade is deemed difficult to thixo-forge, due to its high melting point. The selected part geometries are not feasible with conventional forging. The present study reports the first results of the thixoforging of this steel for a product with specific geometric conditions and the means used and developed.",['spi']
UX-FFE Model : An Experimentation of a new innovation process dedicated to a mature industrial company,"Most of mature companies, operating through a certain form of repeat business in producing incremental innovations, have lost their ability to conduct radical or breakthrough innovations. While this is not necessarily a bad strategy for short-term sustainability, this is more questionable for future growth and long-term sustainability. Hence, we present in this paper a new innovation model, named UX-FFE because it combines both User eXperience and Fuzzy Front-End approaches. It is intended to tackle economical and social challenges of a successful innovation process. Beyond the systemic processes, like the FFE, addressing the economic stake of a company, our model includes an UX-based process in order to address also the social stake. Then, we explain how this new innovation model was concretely implemented, through the use of several techniques and tools, within a mature industrial company. Finally, we unveil the results of this innovation process experiment for evaluating its potential to overcome both economical and social challenges.",['shs']
Simultaneous size/ material optimisation and accurate analysis of composite stiffened panels,"this work deals with the problem of the least-weight design of a composite stiffened panel. The design problem is stated as a constrained non-linear programming problem (CNLPP). Optimisation constraints of different nature are considered: mechanical constraints on the admissible material properties of the laminates as well as on the global buckling load of the panel, geometrical and manufacturability constraints on the geometric design variables of both the skin and the stiffeners. To face such a problem a multi-scale two-level (MS2L) design methodology is proposed. The MS2L design method aims at optimising simultaneously both the geometrical and the material parameters for the skin and the stiffeners at each characteristic scale (meso and macro scales). The MS2L optimisation strategy relies on the one hand on the utilisation of the polar parameters (in the framework of the equivalent single layer theories) for describing the macroscopic behaviour of each laminate composing the panel (both skin and stiffeners) and on the other hand on a special hybrid algorithm (genetic algorithm + gradient-based algorithm) in order to perform the solution search for the problem at hand. In this background, the design problem is split into two different (but related) optimisation problems. At the first level (macroscopic scale) the goal is to find the optimum value of the geometric and material (i.e. the polar parameters) design variables of the panel minimising its mass and meeting (simultaneously) all the requirements provided by the technical specification (i.e. the optimisation constraints) for the problem at hand. The second-level problem focuses on the laminate mesoscopic scale (i.e. the ply-level). Here the goal is the determination of at least one stacking-sequence (for each laminate composing the panel) meeting the optimum value of both the material and geometrical design variables provided by the first-level problem. The effectiveness of the new, non-classical configurations will be verified a posteriori through a refined finite element model of the stiffened panel making use of elements with different kinematics and accuracy (in a global-local sense) in the framework of the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF).","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
From nonlinear system identification to structural health monitoring,"The process of implementing a damage monitoring strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM) and implies a sensor network that monitors the behavior of the structure on-line. A SHM process potentially allows for an optimal use of the monitored structure, a minimized downtime, and the avoidance of catastrophic failures. The SHM process classically relies on four sequential steps that are damage detection, localization, classification, and quantification. The key idea underlying this seminary is that structural damages may result in nonlinear dynamical signatures that are not yet used in SHM despite the fact that they can significantly enhance their monitoring. We thus propose to monitor these structural damages by identifying their nonlinear signature on the basis of a cascade of Hammerstein models representation of the structure. This model is here estimated at very low computational cost by means of the Exponential Sine Sweep Method. It will be shown that on the basis of this richer dynamical representation of the structure, SHM algorithms dedicated to damage detection, classification and quantification can be derived. This will be illustrated in the aeronautic and civil engineering contexts and using experimental as well as numerical data.",['spi']
On the integration of additive manufacturing constraints in the framework of a NURBS-based topology optimisation methodIntégration des contraintes de l'ALM dans le cadre de la méthode d'optimisation topologique basée sur les NURBS,"This work focuses on the topology optimization (TO) of 2D structures: the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation (SIMP) method is revisited and reformulated within the mathematical framework of Non-Uniform Rational BSpline (NURBS) functions. Several advantages arise from such a choice: firstly, a NURBS surface allows for exploiting an implicitly defined filter zone; secondly, the number of optimisation variables (i.e. the parameters defining the NURBS surface) is relatively small when compared to the classical SIMP approach. Finally, the TO can be carried out by including non-conventional manufacturing constraints, as those related to the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology.The proposed TO method is applied to a standard benchmark problem in this paper.Ce travail se focalise sur l’optimisation topologique des structures 2D : la méthode Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation (SIMP) est révisée et reformulée dans le cadre mathématique des fonctions NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational BSpline). Ce choix comporte plusieurs avantages : a)une surface NURBS est caractérisée par une zone de filtre définie de façon implicite ; b) le nombre de variables d’optimisation (à savoir les paramètres qui définissent la surface NURBS) est réduit vis-à-vis de l’approche SIMP classique ;c) les contraintes non-conventionnelles liées au procédé de Fabrication Additive peuvent être facilement intégrées dans le processus d’optimisation topologique grâce au formalisme NURBS .L’efficacité de la méthode d’optimisation topologique proposée sera prouvée via un benchmark classique.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
Squeal measurement using operational deflection shape. Quality assessment and analysis improvement using FEM expansion.,"In presence of squeal, Operational Deflection Shapes (ODS) are classically measured to gain understanding of brake behavior. A simple numeric example is analyzed to justify the use of time-frequency analysis and shows that two real shapes should probably dominate the response. Using measurements on a real brake, this expectation is shown to hold even in the presence of variations with wheel position as well as for reproducibility tests. For a proper relation with the model, it is desirable to also extract modes. The test campaign is used to illustrate how this can be quite difficult due to reproducibility problems. Finally, shapes characterizing the squeal event are fundamentally limited by measurable quantities. Minimum Dynamic Residual Expansion (MDRE), which estimates test motion at all FE degrees of freedom, is shown to be applicable for industrial models and gives insight of test and model imperfections.",['spi']
Elastomer and resin replicas for sem observation of metallic materials,The replica technique is often used to study damage evolution at the surface of specimens or industrial components and understand the physicial phenomena responsible for fatigue crack initiation before failure. Replicas are usually made from acetate cellulose film. This paper presents an alternative technique generally used by archaeologists to study lithic use-wear and bone modification. A mold is made from a dental elastomer (silicon based impression material) and a positive replica is made by casting epoxy resin in the mold. Comparative SEM analysis of damaged metallic specimens and their resin replicas show that this technique provides a good resolution and preserves details up to 0.5 micrometer. This easy and low cost method allows a systematic study of micro-crack growth.,['spi']
Study of the contribution of different effects induced by the punching process on the high cycle fatigue strength of the M330-35A electrical steel,"Because of their improved magnetic properties, Fe-Si alloys are widely used for new electric motor generations. The use of punching process to obtain these components specially affects their mechanical behavior and fatigue strength. This work aims at studying the influence of punching operations on the fatigue behavior of a Fe-Si alloy. High cycle fatigue tests are performed on different smooth specimen configurations with either punched or polished edges. Results show a significant decrease of the fatigue strength for punched specimens compared to polished ones. To understand the origin of the fatigue failure on punched specimens, SEM observations of the fracture surfaces are carried out. They reveal that crack initiation always occurs on a punch defect. Additional experimental techniques are combined to characterize how the edges are altered by punching. The impact of punching operations on residual stresses and hardening is then investigated. Residual stresses are quantified on punched edges using X-ray diffraction techniques. Important tensile residual stresses exist in the loading direction as a result of punching operations. Also, according to XRD analyses and micro-hardness measurements, teh hardened zone depht is about 200µm. To dissociate teh respective influences of strain hardening, residual stresses and geometrical defects, a heat tratment is applied to both punched and polished specimens in order to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the high cycle fatigue resistance. Results show that the geometry of defects is one of teh most influent parameters. Consequantly, a finite element model is developed to simulate teh influence of edge defects on the fatigue strength of punched components. A non-local high cycle fatigue criterion is finally used as a post-processing of FEA to consider the effect of defets and teh associated stress-strain gradients in the HCF strength assessment.",['spi']
Report on identification of keystone species and processes across regional seas,"In managing for marine biodiversity, it is worth recognising that, whilst every species contributes to biodiversity, each contribution is not of equal importance. Some have important effects and interactions, both primary and secondary, on other components in the community and therefore by their presence or absence directly affect the biodiversity of the community as a whole. Keystone species have been defined as species that have a disproportionate effect on their environment relative to their abundance. As such, keystone species might be of particular relevance for the marine biodiversity characterisation within the assessment of Good Environmental Status (GEnS), for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The DEVOTES Keystone Catalogue and associated deliverable document is a review of potential keystone species of the different European marine habitats. The catalogue has 844 individual entries, which includes 210 distinct species and 19 groups classified by major habitat in the Baltic Sea, North East Atlantic, Mediterranean, Black Sea (EU Regional Seas) and Norwegian Sea (Non-­‐EU Sea). The catalogue and the report make use/cite 164 and 204 sources respectively. The keystones in the catalogue are indicated by models, by use as indicators, by published work (e.g. on traits and interactions with other species), and by expert opinion based on understanding of systems and roles of species/groups. A total of 74 species were considered to act as keystone predators, 79 as keystone engineers, 66 as keystone habitat forming species, while a few were thought of having multiple roles in their marine ecosystems. Benthic invertebrates accounted for 50% of the reported keystone species/groups, while macroalgae contributed 17% and fish 12%. Angiosperms were consistently put forward as keystone habitat forming and engineering species in all areas. A significant number of keystones were invasive alien species. Only one keystone, the bivalve Mya arenaria, was common to all four EU regional seas. The Mediterranean Sea had the largest number of potential keystones (56% of the entries) with the least in the Norwegian Sea. There were very few keystones in deep waters (Bathyal-­‐Abyssal, 200+ m), with most reported in sublittoral shallow and shelf seabeds or for pelagic species in marine waters with few in reduced/variable salinity waters. The gaps in coverage and expertise in the catalogue are analysed at the habitat and sea level, within the MSFD biodiversity component groups and in light of knowledge and outputs from ecosystem models (Ecopath with Ecosim). The understanding of keystones is discussed as to when a species may be a dominant or keystone with respect to the definition term concerning ‘disproportionate abundance’, how important are the ‘disproportionate effects’ in relation to habitat formers and engineers, what separates a key predator and key prey for mid-­‐trophic range species and how context dependency makes a species a keystone. Keystone alien invasive species are reviewed and the use of keystone species model outputs investigated. In the penultimate sections of the review the current level of protection on keystone species and the possibilities for a keystone operational metric and their use in management and in GEnS assessments for the MSFD are discussed. The final section highlights the one keystone species and its interactions not covered in the catalogue but with the greatest impact on almost all marine ecosystems, Homo sapiens.",['sde']

Identiﬁcation of technology development trends based on subject–action–object analysis: The case of dye-sensitized solar cells,"Identification of technology development trends is essential for supporting decision-makers in forecasting and identifying related innovation activities as well the industrial growth. In difference of the traditional technology development trends based on SAO, which usually predicting the trend by finding key problems and technologies used to resolve them, the method proposed in this paper allows to identify what industry goal can be achieved by the interaction between the problems and technologies, the detailed paths to achieve it and the key countries which can encourage the trend by engaging technological innovation scenarios. This method builds a technology roadmapping (TRM) with seven layers based on Subject-Action-Object (SAO) analysis, which is composed by material, technology, influencing factor, component, product, goal and application area. It is a combination of vertical and horizontal TRM and has the advantages of both of them. Comparing with the existing technology roadmapping, this method indicates not only the development paths of the key technologies but also those of them that are most opportune to resolve the specific problem and achieve the particular industry goal. Furthermore, with the intention to identify the key countries supporting the technological development, this method sets three indicators acting as the discriminating standards. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, this paper presents a case study of literature related to dye-sensitized solar cells. The result reveals the industry goal and trends in the field of DSSCs, in addition, it can identify the detail approach of the trends and the key countries to support it.",['shs']
Breeding for IPM to boost sustainable crop protection in Europe,"There are several public policy initiatives in Europe to reduce reliance of European cropping systems on conventional pesticides through Integrated Pest Management (IPM). The latter integrates a range of preventative and control measures to reduce pest (pathogens, animal pests and weeds) pressures at all spatial levels from fields to landscapes. Among the preventive measures, crop diversification represents a key component of IPM as recommended by the Directive on Sustainable Use of Pesticides. Nevertheless, currently, European farmers do not have access to sufficient numbers and diversity of crop species/varieties. This prevents them from designing cropping systems more resilient to abiotic and biotic stresses. This talk briefly provides an overview of how breeding for IPM that targets to breed crops adaptable to a range of pedo-climatic conditions will promote IPM with the goal of reducing reliance on conventional pesticides.","['sdv', 'sde', 'shs']"

To What Extent the Grand Lyon Metropole can harness the Smart Meter Project towards the Governance of Territorial Climate Energy Plan (PCET) Study case: Smart Electric Lyon project initiated by EDF [French Electric Utility Company],"In 2012, EDF officially launched smart meter experimentation project in Lyon Metropole area. The project established a consortium named Smart Electric Lyon (SEL) brought in around twenty industrials in energy sector, electrical home automation, information and communication, and supported financially by ADEME (the French environment and energy agency). Technically, the main purpose of SEL is to bring the solutions that are being tested using a new smart meter equipment sensor named "" Linky "" installed in 25,000 homes and 100 businesses. SEL offers information services, technical solutions, and new tariffs to help the consumers to better manage their daily electricity consumption, which are associated with Linky. These new advanced features involve the emergence of a new type fine-grained data of customers' energy consumptions at the level of households or industrial units which is captured automatically by sensor Linky in a real time basis. The data is bi-directionally unfolded and communicated in order to be available for public and private urban managers and also for the customers themselves. In doing so, sensor Linky establishes new data sources beyond traditional methods, censuses, questionnaires, and registries [Desroisiers, 1993], frames what many authors called "" data revolution "" [Kitchin 2014, Townsend 2013, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger 2013] which allows both the traceability and the interoperability of the very fine-grained data of people pattern behaviors [Boullier 2015, Lupton 2014]. Thus, this paper aims principally to determine the consequence of the Big Data Revolution in the daily practice of political and administrative systems. But, first and foremost we tend to apply this leading question within the urban governance issues, whether such big data revolution promotor like SEL could possibly employed as an instrument for the urban managers (notably in the PCET program of Grand Lyon) as enlightened by Margetts and Hood as "" detector and effector "" of urban governance in the digital era [Margetts & Hood, 2013]. A profound and intense observations, which are empirically conducted closely within the Grand Lyon authority, SEL consortium, its instigators, and its first enforcers, had been constituted as our primary source to construct this paper. A cross-actors investigation allow us to grasp the dynamic of SEL involvement in the industrial and also public governance. It is completed by documentary analysis, and ethnographic sequences of observations notably realized within the showroom of SEL. The results of our research shows that Grand Lyon possesses an auspicious ecosystem for the private sectors like EDF to promote smart meter project. SEL has been seen as a successful achievement bearing in mind that SEL has currently become a national standard reference of smart meter. It is a powerful instrument for EDF in respect of market electricity liberalization and a means to readjust the company's market strategy. For the Grand Lyon, the impact of big data revolution to their political practices is still vague, as incorporating the systems to PCET policy remains the subject of power struggle between Grand Lyon and the existence of multi-layers' stakeholders, public, private, and intra-national agencies.",['shs']

Mutual Fund Governance: Depositary Independence and Investor Protection,"The main role of a depositary is to protect investors by providing safekeeping and monitoring services. In Europe in general and in France in particular, it is common for funds and their depositary belong to the same financial group. This ownership linkage between funds and their depositary can affect the effectiveness of the depositary services, and investors might not be well protected. Using a sample of 1,515 French equity funds designed for retail investors, I investigate the effects of the dependence of depositaries on investor protection by comparing performance, risk taking and fees between independent and dependent-depositary funds. The results show that an independent depositary seems to approve more 'fair' fees than a dependent depositary. However, there is no significant difference in performance or in risk taking between these two types of funds. Nevertheless, retail investors seem to care about the independence of the depositary.","['math', 'shs']"
Discontinuity of lift on a hydrofoil in reversed flow for tidal turbine Application,"This work presents an experimental investigation of a hydrofoil in reversed flow configuration in the context of marine current turbine development. Experiments consist in hydrodynamic force measurements and PIV flow observations on a NACA 0015 hydrofoil, at 5 × 105 Reynolds number. The hydrofoil in reversed flow produces a higher lift than in the classical forward flow for very low angles of attack and proved to be relatively efficient for an angle of attack lower than 10°, despite a much higher drag than the same foil in direct flow. Moreover, the lift coefficient shows a discontinuity with an hysteresis effect when the angle of attack is varied up and down around zero-degree. It is shown that the sharp leading edge generates an early Leading Edge Separation Bubble on one side (suction side) even for vanishing angles of attack. This separation bubble triggers the transition to turbulence of the boundary layer on the suction side while the pressure side boundary layer remains laminar. As a consequence, separation on the rounded trailing edge occurs farther downstream on the (turbulent) suction side compared to the (laminar) pressure side. The Leading Edge Separation Bubble and the inherent up–down asymmetry in the boundary layer regime are responsible for the lift singularity.",['spi']
An energy based criterion for high cycle multiaxial fatigue,"In spite of the great number of high cycle multiaxial fatigue in the literature, none predicts the difference that exist between the endurance limits in tension, four point rotative bending and four point plane bending. An enerdy based criterion based on a new concept using the strain energy density is proposed in the paper. This new calculation method explains the previous differnces by taking into account the volumic distribution of the strain energy density around the considered critical point in fatigue. This method, available now under fully reversed mutiaxial loadings, also takes into account the stress state triaxiality. Under combined plane bending and torsion the predictions of the new proposal lead to Gough and Pollard's ellipse quadrant for ductile materials and lead to a curve close to an ellipse arc for brittle materials. Under other multiaxial loadings, predictions are always close to an ellipse quadrant dependent on the loading mode. This method has been tested on smooth cylindrical specimens with several materials; calculations are in very good agreements with multiaxial experimental data.",['spi']
Photoluminescence of Zinc Complexes: Easily Tunable Optical Properties by Variation of the Bridge Between the Imido Groups of Schiff Base Ligands,A series of organic–metal chelate complexes of symmetric tetradentate Schiff base ligands derived from salicylaldehyde and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde were designed and investigated. The combination of five nonconjugated flexible spacers and five conjugated rigid spacers with four salicylaldehyde derivatives provided a series of forty complexes. The series of blue to red photoluminescent complexes was investigated by UV/Vis absorption and luminescence spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state as well as cyclic voltammetry. The nature of the bridge in the ligand scaffold was determined to be the main parameter that influences the absorption and the emission color of the investigated zinc(II) complexes,['chim']
Reductionist approach to chemical rate constants using conditional energy probabilities,"Different rate theories have yielded similar forms of rate constants consistent with the phenomenological Arrhenius law, although they have been derived from various branches of physics including classical thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics. This convergence supports the validity of the Arrhenius law but also suggests the existence of an even simpler underlying principle. A reductionist approach is proposed here in which the energetic exponential factor is a conditional probability of sufficient energy and the pre-exponential factor is the frequency of recurrence of the configuration favorable to the reaction, itself proportional to a configurational probability in a chaotic system. This minimalist yet rigorous mathematical approach makes it possible to bypass certain questionable postulates of more sophisticated theories and clarifies the meaning of the different types of energies used activation energy, threshold energy and chemical energy.",['math']
Do it yourself: make your own thermoacoustic engine with steel wool or rice,"The construction of two demonstrators of thermoacoustic engines is proposed in this paper, using common material from hardware stores. A brief discussion about the thermoacoustic effect highlights the main parameters controlling the generation of self-sustained acoustic oscillations from heat. The construction of the two tabletop demonstrators is then described in detail, so that they can be reproduced with minimum equipment (rice, steel wool, and other hardware easy to find in hardware stores). Experimental results are also presented for both engines and a discussion about their use for teaching purposes is provided.","['spi', 'phys']"
Auguste and Léon Walras and Saint-Simonianism,"The French philosopher and economist Henri Saint-Simon (1760–1825) published numerous writings. Upon his death, his disciples endeavoured to pursue the dissemination of his ideas. A large number of great economists took the time to read Saint-Simon and his successors, and to write about them even when they did not share their ideas. It was the case of Auguste Walras (1801–1866) and his son Léon (1834–1910). The paper examines the relationship the two Walras had with the Saint-Simonians, considers their criticism of the Saint-Simonian political economy and economic policy and highlight their adherence to the opposition between idlers and workers.",['shs']
The value of specialist care—infectious disease specialist referrals—why and for whom? A retrospective cohort study in a French tertiary hospital,"This study evaluated the impact of infectious disease (ID) specialist referrals on outcomes in a tertiary hospital in France. This study tackled methodological constraints (selection bias, endogeneity) using instrumental variables (IV) methods in order to obtain a quasi-experimental design. In addition, we investigated whether certain characteristics of patients have a bearing on the impact of the intervention. We used the payments database and ID department files to obtain data for adults admitted with an ID diagnosis in the North Hospital, Marseille from 2012 to 2014. Comparable cohorts were obtained using coarsened exact matching and analysed using IV models. Mortality, readmissions, cost (payer perspective) and length of stay (LoS) were analysed. We recorded 15,393 (85.97%) stays, of which 2,159 (14.03%) benefited from IDP consultations. The intervention was seen to significantly lower the risk of inpatient mortality (marginal effect (M.E) = –19.06%) and cost of stay (average treatment effect (ATE) = – €5,573.39). The intervention group was seen to have a longer LoS (ATE = +4.95 days). The intervention conferred a higher reduction in mortality and cost for stays that experienced ICU care (mortality: odds ratio (OR) =0.09, M.E cost = –8,328.84 €) or had a higher severity of illness (mortality: OR=0.35, M.E cost = –1,331.92 €) and for patients aged between 50 and 65 years (mortality: OR=0.28, M.E cost = -874.78 €). This study shows that ID referrals are associated with lower risk of inpatient mortality and cost of stay, especially when targeted to certain subgroups.",['sdv']
Journalism ethics in a digital environment,"Journalism is facing new ethical issues because of the emergence of the Internet and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). In this article, we examine how journalistic codes of ethics have been updated to address this new reality. Three research questions are explored through a systematic analysis of 99 codes from around the world. Results show that, of the 99 codes analyzed, only 9 include references to the Internet and ICTs. We conclude with proposals for changes in the codes that would help journalists resolve these new moral issues.",['shs']
Detection of Rhodamine 6G at low concentrations using Raman Spectroscopy: A comparison between Ag and Au-based nanoporous substrates,"The detection of R6G on nanoporous susbtrates at low concentrations (10(-4) M < C < 10(-7)M) was studied coupling its thermodynamic adsorption properties and its Raman response. Two susbtrates were used, they consist in a mesoporous silica matrix in which Ag or Au nanoparticles are incorporated. From a thermodynamic point of view, it was evidenced, using adsorption isotherms and enthalpies, that R6G presents a higher affinity towards Ag@SiO2 than Au@SiO2. Furthermore, for C > 1.10(-6) M, it was evidenced that R6G Raman response does not depend on metal chemical nature. It is linearly correlated to R6G adsorbed amounts, evidencing the pre-concentration property of the substrates. For lower concentrations, differences were observed in Raman responses. For C = 1.10(-6) M, the Raman bands of R6G adsorbed on SiO2 and Au@SiO2 are similar to those found at higher concentrations. For Ag@SiO2, two new bands, corresponding to bending modes of ethylamine groups, are present as well as the band related to Ag-N stretching mode. This was explained by the specific interaction developed between R6G and Ag@SiO2. For C = 1.10(-7) M, only the two bands related to R6G ethylamine groups are present for all substrates and a Raman signal enhancement was found for Ag-based substrate.",['chim']
"Working women in France, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Where, when, and which women were in work at marriage?","We look at women's labour force participation for the whole of France in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We study to what extent young women were working at the time of their marriage, in which occupations, and how differences in labour force participation might be explained. Using a sample of 53,451 marriage records from the TRA project, we identify regional and temporal differences in rates of female labour force participation and in types of work in France between 1860 and 1986.We observe rather stable levels of female labour force participation between 1860 and 1950 of about 60 per cent, but higher levels in the second half of the twentieth century. Over time, women started to work across virtually all occupational sectors. Regional differences declined over time but continued to exist in the late twentieth century. We formulate a set of hypotheses to explain which women worked, taking into account their resources, as well as their expectations, in a male-breadwinner-dominated society. The results of our hierarchical logistic analysis indicate that women with fewer parental resources were more likely to work.",['sdv']
Innovation capabilities for global R&D projects in subsidiariesCapacités d'innovation pour les projets de R&D mondiaux dans les filiales,"Purpose Is the development of local innovation capabilities enough for foreign subsidiaries in emerging markets to be able to integrate into global R&D projects? The authors argue that it is not. The purpose of this paper is to show the central role of R&D capacities when it comes to inserting foreign subsidiaries in emerging markets into global R&D projects. Design/methodology/approach The study investigated 131 foreign multinational subsidiaries operating in Brazil. For each subsidiary, the authors surveyed two to five directors or C-level executives from innovation, R&D, engineering, product development and projects. the authors used structural equation modeling for analysis. Findings The results indicate that product and process innovations alone do not guarantee the insertion of the emerging market subsidiaries into global innovation projects. Such insertion depends on the subsidiary’s accumulation of R&D capacities. Practical implications The results reinforce the central issue of building product and process innovation capabilities as the first step toward a blueprint for global projects. However, the effort is not limited to these initiatives. Product and process innovation efforts need be reverted in headquarters’ eyes in order for subsidiaries to gain R&D center status. To achieve this, subsidiaries must align their technological innovations with multinational corporations’ innovation strategies. Originality/value In authors’ view, this study contributes to the literature in three main areas: the evolutionary process of innovation capability in subsidiaries, the reverse innovation debate and the discussion of subsidiaries’ initiatives.",['shs']

Calculations of thermoelectric properties: Mg2Si under uniaxial [110] strains versus (110)-oriented thin film,"Investigations of the electronic properties and transport properties of Mg2Si under uniaxial [110] strain have been performed by using first-principle density-functional and Boltzmann's transport theories. The effect of compressive and tensile uniaxial strains has been studied by changing the. angle of the conventional cell from +/- 1 degrees to +/- 4 degrees. We show that, the Seebeck property of the constrained bulk lattice at high temperature, when plotted with respect to the charge carrier concentrations, is similar to that of the (110) thin film at low temperature. This behaviour is evidenced when superimposing the Seebeck coefficient curves of both materials by shifting down the S curve of the constrained structure by about 150 K with respect to the temperature.",['chim']
"The thermo-mechano-chemical twin-screw reactor, a new perspective for the biorefinery of sunflower whole plant","Biorefinery of sunflower whole plant was performed successfully using a thermo-mechano-chemical twin-screw reactor. This led to the aqueous extraction of oil and other biopolymers like proteins, pectins and non pectic sugars. It resulted in the overall fractionation of biomass, thus allowing a complete valorization of the input. This biorefinery process was not only efficient but it was also environment-friendly. In addition, it contributed to the production of different end products for various industrial applications. Firstly, the hydrophilic phase will be recycled to the process. Secondly, the densest oil-in-water emulsion is a promising candidate for the formulation of cosmetic creams. Thirdly, the upper hydrophobic phase will be usable for the waterproofing treatment of the surface of agromaterials by coating. Its demixing will also lead to the production of proteins with tensioactive properties. These will serve for the food industry. Lastly, the cake was a mixture of plasticized proteins and lignocellulosic fibers. It was thus considered as a natural composite. Its molding into cohesive fiberboards was conducted successfully using both thermopressing and compression molding processes. The self-bonded boards with high density will be suitable for use as load bearing boards in dry conditions (floor underlayers, interior partitions, furniture, etc.). Positioned in walls and ceilings, boards with medium and low density will contribute to the heat insulation of buildings. In addition, the bulk cake will be also usable as a loose fill insulation material. As proposed, this flow chart thus allows a valorization for all fractions originating from the twin-screw reactor.","['sdv', 'chim']"
Plant protein for food: opportunities and bottlenecks,"Dietary proteins represent a key issue for the future regarding worldwide food security. Besides animal sources, plant proteins represent an opportunity to mainly contribute to protein demand. Whether some plant protein sources could appear as deficient in some essential amino acids, mixtures from different sources could represent opportunities to further propose adapted supply regarding specific demand. Such opportunities includes legumes as well as by-products of oil processing, i.e. canola and sunflower cakes. The nutritional benefits of such new sources are still under investigation considering benefits and limits like allergenicity. Finally, consumer behavior and acceptability remains the final bottleneck for developing new protein sources.",['sdv']
A product functional modelling approach based on the energy flow by using characteristics-properties modelling,"The main objective in designing a product is to satisfy the required needs. So, the designer aims to design the product’s structure based on the required function of the product. Therefore, in the design process, the link between the functional requirement and the physical structure has to be assured. This paper proposes an approach to help the designer in transition from function to structure to assure this link. This approach uses energy flow modelling to model the system’s behaviour in the framework of characteristics-properties modelling (CPM). It is composed of a multi-level modelling approach with two concurrent, interlinked modelling domains: functional and structural. By zigzagging between these two domains in each level of the decomposition, a quantitative model of the product is determined using CPM. The result shows the effective modifiable parameters (or required structure) of the product to satisfy the required function. So, it can be used to design a new product as well as analysing and optimising an existing product.",['spi']
"Design for human safety in manufacturing systems: applications of design theories, methodologies, tools and techniques","During recent decades, there has been growing awareness of human safety in the design process. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on design for human safety (DfHS) in manufacturing systems. To this end, a process for systematically reviewing DfHS studies was used. The authors focused in particular on the applications of design theories and methodologies (DTM) and design tools and techniques (DTT) to analyse and identify work situations in order to improve human safety in manufacturing system design. The authors also tried to identify the design phases in which these DTM and DTT could be applied. This research review covered papers published between 1980 and 2015, and combined seven groups of terms: DfHS, design, safety, DTM, DTT, risk and working situation. A critical analysis was also performed in view to defining a research agenda and the most prominent key actions capable of pointing out paths for future research.",['spi']
Approximate analytical solutions for consumption/investment problems under recursive utility and finite horizon,"We study the asset allocation and consumption decisions of an investor with recursive utility and a finite investment horizon. We provide an approximate analytical solution under a stochastic investment opportunity set. The solution becomes exact when the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is equal to one or under a constant opportunity set. We show that this elasticity impacts both consumption and portfolio strategies, indicating the importance of disentangling intertemporal substitution from risk aversion. The investor’s horizon also plays a crucial role in optimal policies and the usual infinite horizon framework is inappropriate for investors having short- or medium-term horizons. Moreover, the infinite horizon problem reveals the existence of conditions on the preference parameters for our solution to hold, raising the question of whether another solution may exist or not. On its turn, the absence of a bequest motive in the finite horizon problem imposes another condition on risk parameters.",['shs']
Food losses and waste in the French oilcrops sector,"INRA has initiated a comprehensive approach to food loss and waste for all the plant and animal sectors, from field to distribution. In this study, all comestibles that leave the human food chain and are not recycled into animal feed are considered as losses and waste. The main French oilseed sectors are studied (rapeseed, sunflower and soya, as well as tofu). In order to identify the key sources of loss, all of the various steps in the process of the oleaginous production chain are described, from harvesting through to distribution, including storage, transport, crushing, refining and packaging. For tofu, the study also examines the chain from harvest through to distribution, including as soy milk and tofu paste. Published data are lacking; they were therefore primarily collected directly from professionals in the sectors concerned. Although oilseeds and vegetable oils are apt to have a relatively long shelf-life compared to other products, losses of vegetable oil from field to distribution are substantial (approximately 71.4 kT, equivalent to 10% of the amount consumed in France). We establish that the principal steps giving rise to losses are harvesting and refining. Total losses in French rapeseed oil, sunflower and soybean were estimated at 9.8%, 7.0% and 6.0% of their respective total potential production, worth approximately 50.6, 14.3 and 6.5 e million and equivalent to the annual consumption of approximately 3 030 000, 855 000 and 390 000 people. In the case of tofu, harvest is the most important area of loss. Total losses of tofu are equivalent to 8.2% of potential production. We discuss potential measures to improve the efficiency of the individual steps of French oilseed production.",['sdv']
Do-It-Yourself medicine? The impact of light cannabis liberalization on prescription drugs,"Governments worldwide are increasingly concerned about the booming use of CBD (cannabidiol) products. However, we know little about the impact of their liberalization. We study a unique case of unintended liberalization of a CBD-based product (light cannabis) that occurred in Italy in 2017. Using unique and high-frequency data on prescription drug sales and by exploiting the staggered local availability of the new product in each Italian province, we document a significant substitution effect between light cannabis and anxiolytics, sedatives, opioids, anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. Results are informative for regulators and suggest that bans on light cannabis use would disregard the needs of patients to seek effective reliefs of their symptoms.",['shs']
"Python libraries matplotlib, seaborn and pandas for visualization geospatial datasets generated by QGIS","This work aim is to perform modelling and spatial analysis of the marine geological data using combination of the QGIS and Python programming. Selecting proper cartographic software is important part of the geospatial research. QGIS provides organizing data in a GIS project for mapping and spatial visualization through vector and raster layers stored in GIS. Study area is Mariana Trench, west Pacific Ocean. A series of cross-section profiles were digitized in QGIS and used for further data processing in Python. Mariana Trench has complex geomorphic structure and unevenness in profiles stretching south-westwards. The geomorphology is subjected to various phenomena that affect its shape. These include bathymetry, geodesy, gravimetry, tectonics plates and geological settings, studied in this paper. To understand the structure of the trench, a data modelling using bathymetric analysis was performed by combination of QGIS mapping and statistical analysis in Python's library Seaborn. Statistical data modelling aimed at the analysis of the spatial variation of the geomorphology of the trench using following methods: multiple facet grids, area charts for the data frames, regression analysis, letter-value plots, hexagonal and Kernel density estimation. The results of the geospatial data analysis show spatial unevenness of the geomorphic structure, gravimetric, geodetic and bathymetric settings of the Mariana Trench. The study demonstrated effectiveness of Python application in geographic data analysis with Python codes provided for repeatability.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"
Mapping Beaufort Sea Topography and Geophysical Settings Using High-Resolution Geospatial Data and GMT,"The papers presents an integrated processing of the high-resolution thematic data covering the area of the Beaufort Sea, a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean, northern Canada and Alaska. Five thematic maps of the Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean are presented. The cartographic techniques were performed by Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) scripting toolset. The methodology presents the integration of the multi-source high-resolution thematic datasets: bathymetric GEBCO, IBCAO, topographic GLOBE, sediment thickness GlobSed, EGM2008 geoid model, GMT vector layers and geophysical gravity model from CryoSat-2 and Jason-1. There is an agreement with the data by their inspection and analysis of grids correlation. The bathymetric map demonstrated variations in depths with rapidly decreasing values in the Mackenzie River coasts, depicting the basin of the Beaufort Sea, large shelf in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and western part bordering the Chukchi Sea. The GDAL inspection shows that the GEBCO-based topography ranges between -3,973 m to 2,578 m. Gravity data shows that coastal areas in northern Canada and Alaska have values >20 mGal while the basin of the Beaufort Sea is dominated by the lower values at -65 to -45 mGal; the data range is from -155.097 to 366.939 mGal. The marine free-air gravity fields and geoid data demonstrate correlation with topographic isolines of the region. The data range for the sediment thickness is from 0.00 to 18064.53 m having maximal data at the Mackenzie River discharge area. A comprehensive compilation of the data on the Beaufort Sea visualized using GMT presents more insights into its bathymetric structure and geophysical fields distribution in context of the variability of the geological settings.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"
"Medical Care, Screening and Regularization of Sub-Saharan Irregular Migrants Affected by Hepatitis B in France and Italy.","Both in France and in Italy hepatitis B is present mostly among the migrant population coming from sub-Saharan Africa and mainly among those migrants having a poor socio-economic background. This article is aimed at assaying the impact of public policies adopted by France and Italy for migrants' health on the treatment of migrants with HBV. The article is based on semi-structured interviews conducted with 30 immigrant adults taken into care by two associations dealing with medical, psychological and social issues of immigrants applying for a residence permit, mainly asylum seekers. The results of this study bring to light specific difficulties relating to national contexts, to the type of HBV (inactive or active) and to the administrative situation of the migrants. In France irregular migrants are screened in humanitarian associations. In Italy the screening is done in public hospitals. In both countries, only migrants suffering from chronic hepatitis B obtain a residence permit for medical reasons. More migrants in Italy than in France abandon HBV treatment. This study describes how specific national immigration and health policies impact in a different way the therapeutic and social path of migrants suffering from hepatitis B. The analysis provides useful material for the development of strategies to prevent and control hepatitis B among the migrant population. It also shows how social determinants affect migrants' health more than values or cultural factors do.",['sdv']
Veal calf industry economicsL’économie de la filière veau de boucherie,"This paper provides an outline of the veal industry, its standing relative to other cattle farming enterprises, and its future prospects. In 2008 some 20 per cent of bovines slaughtered in the EU were for veal production and about one-third of them were dairy calves. France, the Netherlands and Italy were Europe’s leading producers. Veal consumption in the European Union has been in steady decline since 1970. In 2008, it averaged 1.6 kg per capita, with France and Italy being the largest consumers. Despite variations in farming systems and carcass characteristics from one country to another, veal production is an important outlet for milk replacer producers and provides a market for their industrial dairy products. Regular changes in production factors such as the price of 8-day-old calves and milk replacers and their availability engender recurrent output fluctuations. Veal calf production plays a major part in regulating the milk and bovine-meat markets: it has largely contributed to stemming dairy (and sometimes meat) surpluses. However, the context has changed since 2008 with no more surplus milk supply and reduced EU-support for incorporating skimmed milk powder into milk feeds. Therefore, the relative attractiveness of other productions using 8-day-old calves and the support policies for cattle farming as a whole will affect the future of the veal calf industry.L’article présente les principales caractéristiques du secteur du veau de boucherie dit « industriel », sa place relative dans les productions bovines et ses perspectives d’avenir. En 2008, la production de veau de boucherie représentait 20 % des abattages de bovins abattus dans l’Union européenne et concernait plus du tiers des veaux issus du troupeau laitier. Elle était concentrée essentiellement dans 3 pays (France, Pays-Bas et Italie). Côté demande, la consommation dans l’Union européenne s’élevait en 2008 à 1,6 g/hab/an, la France et l’Italie étant les principaux pays consommateurs. Elle est en déclin régulier depuis 1970. En dépit de variations dans les systèmes d’élevages et les caractéristiques des carcasses produites dans les différents pays, la production était largement intégrée par des fabricants d’aliments de substitution au lait : elle constituait un marché pour les produits laitiers industriels que ces derniers fabriquent. Les variations fréquentes des facteurs de production (prix et disponibilité des veaux de 8 jours ou de la poudre de lait) sont responsables de fluctuations récurrentes des volumes produits. Le secteur du veau de boucherie joue un rôle majeur dans la régulation des marchés du lait et de la viande bovine : il a largement contribué à la résorption des excédents de lait (et parfois de viande). Cependant, depuis 2008, le contexte a changé (absence d’excédent laitier, soutien financier à l’incorporation de poudre de lait dans les aliments de substitution en baisse…). Aussi, l’attractivité relative des autres productions utilisant les veaux de 8 jours et les politiques de soutien à l’ensemble de l’élevage bovin influeront sur le futur du secteur du veau de boucherie.",['sdv']
"Putative 3D Structure of QcrB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cytochrome bc1 Complex, a Novel Drug-Target for New Series of Antituberculosis Agent Q203","Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is still a serious world health problem. There is an urgent need for an effective drug against rapidly arising multiple-drug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant M. tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains. Q203 was recently reported as the most promising M. tuberculosis agent, which is also active against MDR-TB and XDR-TB. The cyto-chrome b subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex (QcrB) was identified as a drug target in M. tuberculosis (Rv2196) for Q203. Herein, we have built the homology models of M. tuberculosis QcrB WT and T313A mutants using the X-ray structures of other species' QcrB as templates: Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Paracoccus denitrificans, yeast and bovine. The model with the best quality based on the structural validation results was selected for docking and used for analyzing Q203-binding mode. These insightful information will be beneficial to the further development of imidazo pyridine amide series as novel antituberculosis drugs.",['info']
In situ dilatometric and impedance spectroscopic study of core–shell like structures: insights into the exceptional catalytic activity of nanocrystalline Cu-doped CeO 2,"Cu-doped CeO2 (8 mol% Cu) nanoparticles were investigated by combined in situ dilatometry and impedance spectroscopy as a means of exploring the impact of temperature and pO(2) driven dopant redistribution and phase separation on both thermo-mechanical and electrical properties of the CuOx-CeO2 system. Dilatometry was used to track the thermal expansion of the CeO2 nanoparticles as well as the reduction of segregated copper oxide into metallic copper when exposed to reducing conditions. The electrical properties of the nanoparticle array, extracted from impedance spectroscopy studies, point to proton conduction at low temperatures, with a transition to n-type electronic conductivity of CeO2 at higher temperatures. After segregation of percolating interfacial layers, induced by exposure to reducing atmosphere, the electrical properties become dominated by p-type Cu2O at intermediate pO(2) and metallic copper at low pO(2). The temperature and pO(2) dependent electrical properties of both the Cu2O shell and the underlying ceria core were examined in light of defect chemical models. Based on these models, the standard formation enthalpy of copper vacancies and holes in Cu2O and the standard formation enthalpy of oxygen vacancies and electrons in CeO2 were found to be equal to Delta H-ox,Cu2O(0) = (2.4 +/- 0.4) eV and Delta H-red,CeO2(0) = (1.5 +/- 0.3) eV, respectively. These findings are discussed in relation to the exceptional catalytic activity of copper-ceria for various oxidation-reduction reactions, focusing on the roles of both nano-dimensions and the influence of Cu on the redox properties of CeO2.",['chim']
An efficient method for mining the maximal α-quasi-clique-community of a given node in complex networks,"Detecting communities in large complex networks is important to understand their structure and to extract features useful for visualisation or pre- diction of various phenomena like the diffusion of infor- mation or the dynamic of the network. A community is defined by a set of strongly interconnected nodes. An α-quasi-clique is a group of nodes where each mem- ber is connected to more than a proportion α of the other nodes. By construction, an α-quasi-clique has a density greater than α. The size of an α-quasi-clique is limited by the degree of its nodes. In complex net- works whose degree distribution follows a power law, usually α-quasi-cliques are small sets of nodes for high values of α. In this paper, we present an efficient method for finding the maximal α-quasi-clique of a given node in the network. Therefore, the resulting communities of our method have two main characteristics: they are α-quasi-cliques (very dense for high α) and they are local to the given node. Detecting the local commu- nity of specific nodes is very important for applications dealing with huge networks, when iterating through all nodes would be impractical or when the network is not entirely known. The proposed method, called RANK- NUM-NEIGHS (RNN), is evaluated experimentally on real and computer generated networks in terms of qual- ity (community size), execution time and stability. We also provide an upper bound on the optimal solution.",['info']
Driver trust and reliance on a navigation system: Effect of graphical display,"The present study investigates the influence of in-car navigation system graphic’s appearance on driver trust and reliance on the system. Two navigation systems were used: one with a realistic interface and one with a symbolic interface. During driving sessions on a simulator, the systems committed some guidance incoherencies regarding road signs present in the virtual environment. Subject’s trust and reliance on navigation systems were measured and compared between both systems. Result showed a higher level of trust for the realistic appearance system than for the symbolic one during the whole experiment. The presence of incoherencies decreased trust level for both systems but without any significant difference. No difference in system’s reliance was found but two groups of subjects were identified. One group is highly relying on both navigation systems’ indication when incoherence occurs whereas the other group was not. This study highlights the interaction of subjective items, as system graphical appearance, on user trust. Further experiments using a modified experimental setup may be needed to analyze precisely the influence on user relianceCette étude analyse l’influence de l’apparence graphique d’un système d’aide à la navigation sur le niveau de confiance et d’utilisation du système par le conducteur. Deux systèmes d’aide sont utilisés : un avec une interface graphique réaliste, et un avec une interface graphique simpliste.

Le niveau de confiance des sujets envers le système et son utilisation sont enregistrés et comparés entre les deux systèmes d’aide à la navigation. Les résultats montrent un niveau de confiance plus élevé tout au long de l’expérience pour le système avec une interface graphique réaliste. La présence d’incohérences de guidage engendre bien une diminution du niveau de confiance mais sans différence notable entre les deux systèmes.

"Corporate governance, performance and liquidity risk: WAEMU’s banks focus","Over the past two decades, several corporates collapses and scandals lead to track down any deficiencies in the corporate governance mechanisms. Among these collapses and scandals, we list that of Enron (2001) and WorldCom (2002) in USA, Vivendi (2001) and Vinci (2006) in France, Parmalat (2003) in Italy, and most recently that of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated’s boardroom « battle » (2013) in West African Context. On the basis of Jensen and Meckling (1976) agency theory, this paper examines the relation between corporate governance mechanisms and operating performance and liquidity risk within the specific environment of West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) banks. The implementation of well-known western corporate governance mechanisms in emerging markets, which mostly focus on unsophisticated financial services, is likely to act more as operating constraints than value-creation factors. Based on a sample drawn from 100 commercial banks over the period 2006–2010, we document the following three main findings: (1) dual structure and board size are negatively and significantly associated with banks’ performance as proxied by ROA and ROE, (2) board size, board diversity and nature of ownership exhibit a negative and significant relation with banks’ liquidity risk, (3) the presence of CEO in the directors’ board appears to be the only corporate governance mechanism efficiently associated with banks’ liquidity risk.",['shs']
"Waves, modes and properties with a major impact on dynamic pantograph-catenary interaction","Understanding the dynamic behavior of the pantograph-catenary system is crucial for design improvement, but many factors inuence the contact force, which is the main design objective. To give a proper un-derstanding of dynamic characteristics, the paper uses a combination of mass drop tests on a catenary, analytic models and parametric _nite element model simulations allowing a ne analysis of the inuence of train speed. The _rst contributor to contact force variations is the geometry of the catenary under gravity loading. This parameter is however shown to be insu_cient to explain higher frequency e_ects. The second contributor is the propagation of waves in the contact and messenger wires. The inuence of wave dis-persion is _rst demonstrated, which emphasizes the importance of considering the bending sti_ness. Wave compensation by droppers and reections at the mast are then shown to be important. Characteristic times associated with wave group velocities are _nally used to explain the series of harmonic contributions visible in spectra in the catenary and pantograph frames. Finally, modes are shown to play a role particularly when their frequencies coincide with other contributions. The notion of mode groups, associated wave velocities and relevant design variables are discussed. Several observations pave the way for future work on catenary design.",['spi']
A modal H∞-norm-based performance requirement for damage-tolerant active controller design,"Damage-tolerant active control (DTAC) is a recent research area that encompasses control design methodologies resulting from the application of fault-tolerant control methods to vibration control of structures subject to damage. The possibility of damage occurrence is not usually considered in the active vibration control design requirements. Damage changes the structure dynamics, which may produce unexpected modal behavior of the closed-loop system, usually not anticipated by the controller design approaches. A modal H∞H∞ norm and a respective robust controller design framework were recently introduced, and this method is here extended to face a new DTAC strategy implementation. Considering that damage affects each vibration mode differently, this paper adopts the modal H∞H∞ norm to include damage as a design requirement. The basic idea is to create an appropriate energy distribution over the frequency range of interest and respective vibration modes, guaranteeing robustness, damage tolerance, and adequate overall performance, taking into account that it is common to have previous knowledge of the structure regions where damage may occur during its operational life. For this purpose, a structural health monitoring technique is applied to evaluate modal modifications caused by damage. This information is used to create modal weighing matrices, conducting to the modal H∞H∞ controller design. Finite element models are adopted for a case study structure, including different damage severities, in order to validate the proposed control strategy. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with respect to damage tolerance.",['spi']
Biohackers tackle the coronavirus,"The World Health Organization, ministries, doctors, the media: it’s hardly surprising that all these actors produce and communicate data on the coronavirus (COVID-19). But that hackers and biohackers take up the subject is far more astonishing. This article discusses hackathons (both face-to-face and online) that have been organized to tackle the coronavirus. These hackathons have pursued various aims: understanding the genome of the coronavirus and how it spreads; doing data analysis, modeling and simulation; creating new prototypes, etc. In general, the hackathons aim to democratize the coronavirus by imagining and sharing tools, software, data, and models. Current discussions revolve around the possibility and the dangers of developing DIY tests to diagnose the virus. The proliferation of biohackers’ ideas will now face the biological complexity and geopolitical reality of the coronavirus.","['sdv', 'shs']"
Multiscale functional analysis of wear: A fractal model of the grinding process,"In this paper, we propose to create a fractal function defined by an infinite series to model worn surfaces obtained by a grinding process. In this series, each elementary term characterizes a wear process at a given scale. This series is only defined by two parameters: an amplitude parameter and the fractal dimension. This model is tested on worn profiles obtained by using different grinding paper grades and roughness is assessed by tactile profilometry. Then an inverse method is developed to obtain simulated profiles that present the same morphology as the experimental ones. The results from this study prove that our method allows simulation of profiles with elementary functions that characterize the wear process.","['info', 'spi']"
Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Magnesium (II) Gluconate Solution,"Magnesium gluconate is a classical pharmaceutical compound used as a source of magnesium for the prevention and treatment of hypomagnesemia. To the best of our knowledge, a robust and reliable liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry technique has not yet been reported for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of magnesium gluconate. This study describes the method development for the LC–ESI–MS/MS analysis of magnesium gluconate using three different reversed-phase HPLC conditions (Method I–III) with comprehensive fragmentation pattern and the structural characterization by NMR spectroscopy. The LC–MS and NMR data were found in accordance with the structure of magnesium gluconate. When magnesium gluconate was dissolved in the acetonitrile and water–methanol solutions, it exists in situ in three different forms: magnesium gluconate itself, gluconic acid, and magnesium gluconate chelate with gluconic acid by a coordinate covalent bond. Method I exhibited pseudo-molecular ion peaks with more magnesium gluconate chelates with gluconic acid, while method II showed an adduct of magnesium gluconate with the solvent along with the molecular ion peak. There was no pseudo-molecular ion peaks found in method III. Thus, method III was found to be the more accurate, robust and reliable LC–MS method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis, structural characterization, and could also be suitable for the pharmacokinetic study of magnesium gluconate. The detailed fragmentation analysis might be useful for the structural characterization of unknown divalent organometallics.",['sdv']
Polycrystalline Mg2Si thin films: A theoretical investigation of their electronic transport properties,"The electronic structures and thermoelectric properties of a polycrystalline Mg2Si thin film have been investigated by first-principle density-functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport theory calculations within the constant-relaxation time approximation. The polycrystalline thin film has been simulated by assembling three types of slabs each having the orientation (001), (110) or (111) with a thickness of about 18 angstrom. The effect of applying the relaxation procedure to the thin film induces disorder in the structure that has been ascertained by calculating radial distribution functions. For the calculations of the thermoelectric properties, the energy gap has been fixed at the experimental value of 0.74 eV. The thermoelectric properties, namely the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity and the power factor, have been determined at three temperatures of 350 K. 600 K and 900 K with respect to both the energy levels and the p-type and n-type doping levels. The best Seebeck coefficient is obtained at 350 K: the S-yy), component of the tensor amounts to about +/- 1000 mu V K-1, depending on the type of charge carriers. However, the electrical conductivity is much too small which results in low values of the figure of merit ZT. Structure-property relationship correlations based on directional radial distribution functions allow us to tentatively draw some explanations regarding the anisotropy of the electrical conductivity. Finally, the low Zr values obtained for the polycrystalline Mg2Si thin film are paralleled with those recently reported in the literature for bulk chalcogenide glasses. 0 2015 Elsevier Inc.

An Empirical Analysis of Mergers: Efficiency Gains and Impact on Consumer Prices,"In this article, we extend the literature on merger simulation models by incorporating its potential synergy gains into structural econometric analysis. We present a three-step integrated approach. We estimate a structural demand and supply model, as in Bonnet and Dubois (2010). This model allows us to recover the marginal cost of each differentiated product. Then we estimate potential efficiency gains using the Data Envelopment Analysis approach of Bogetoft and Wang (2005), and some assumptions about exogenous cost shifters. In the last step, we simulate the new price equilibrium post merger taking into account synergy gains, and derive price and welfare effects. We use a homescan dataset of dairy dessert purchases in France, and show that for two of the three mergers considered, synergy gains could offset the upward pressure on prices post. Some mergers could then be considered as not harmful for consumers.",['shs']
Application of the generalized lambda distributions in a statistical process control methodology,"In statistical process control (SPC) methodology, quantitative standard control charts are often based on the assumption that the observations are normally distributed. In practice, normality can fail and consequently the determination of assignable causes may result in error. After pointing out the limitations of hypothesis testing methodology commonly used for discriminating between Gaussian and non-Gaussian populations, a very flexible family of statistical distributions is presented in this paper and proposed to be introduced in SPC methodology: the generalized lambda distributions (GLD). It is shown that the control limits usually considered in SPC are accurately predicted when modelling usual statistical laws by means of these distributions. Besides, simulation results reveal that an acceptable accuracy is obtained even for a rather reduced number of initial observations (approximately a hundred). Finally, a specific user-friendly software have been used to process, using the SPC Western Electric rules, experimental data originating from an industrial production line. This example and the fact that it enables us to avoid choosing an a priori statistical law emphasize the relevance of using the GLD in SPC.",['math']

Comparison between Microwave Infrared Thermography and CO2 Laser Infrared Thermography in Defect Detection in Applications with CFRP,"This paper presents two infrared thermography methods with CO2 Laser excitation and microwave excitation applied to defect detection in CFRP. The tests were conducted with two specimens, one with defect, and another one without defect. On two concrete plates 40 cm× 40 cm× 4.5 cmwere reinforced by CFRP; the defects were made by the absence of adhesive on an area10 cm× 10 cm. The specimens were heated by microwave, generated by a commercial magnetron of 2.45 GHz and guided by a pyramidal horn antenna, with a power of 360 W within 150 s. Another series of the tests was conducted with CO2 Laser, wavelength 10.6 μm, by heating the samples with a power of 300 W within 40 s. An infrared camera sensitive to medium waves in range of 3 - 5 μm, with a detector of 320 × 256 matrix detector in InSb (Indium Antimonide), was used to record the thermograms. As a result, the CO2 Laser excitation is better for the delamination detection in CFRP. This study opens interesting perspectives for inspecting other types of defects in materials sciences; the microwave excitation is suitable for the deep defects in the materials whereas the CO2 Laser excitation is better for the defects near the surface of the materials.",['spi']

La relégation des récidivistes : enjeux politique et pénal,"La relégation des récidivistes : enjeux politique et pénal La loi du 27 mai 1885, dite loi sur la relégation des récidivistes, représente une date importante dans l'histoire pénale française. Cette loi introduit effectivement en droit pénal le principe de dangerosité et aménage une présomption irréfragable d'incorrigibilité censée mesurer le degré de dangerosité d'un criminel ou d'un délinquant récidiviste. Loi d'élimination sociale comme la décline ses promoteurs, la relégation s'articule comme une peine secondaire qui s'ajoute à une peine principale et se traduit par une mesure de sûreté et d'éloignement prise contre des condamnés jugés « incorrigibles ». La relégation va ainsi permettre à une puissance coloniale de se débarrasser de 1887 à 1938 de près de 22 163 condamnés : 4 270 relégués en Nouvelle-Calédonie (1887-1897) et 17 375 en Guyane (1887-1938). Les cibles de cette loi sont des délinquants récidivistes condamnés pour des motifs de vol simple ou de vagabondage aggravé et la relégation est essentiellement prononcée par des tribunaux correctionnels. Pour se prononcer, le magistrat est simplement tenu de comptabiliser le nombre de condamnations inscrites au casier judiciaire d'un prévenu ou d'un condamné et si ce nombre emporte une des combinaisons prévues par le quantum de la loi, il est obligé à l'issue de son verdict de prononcer la relégation. Ce résultat, aussi surprenant qu'il puisse paraître, est issu de la volonté d'un homme, Léon Gambetta et de ses successeurs opportunistes au Parlement tout au long d'un débat qui mobilise députés et sénateurs durant près de deux ans (1883-1885). Cette loi, si sévère soit-elle, s'inscrit au sein d'une réforme pénale qui tient compte des principales conclusions dégagés par des experts du crimes et des peines à partir de la seconde moitié du XIXème siècle et s'articule autour d'une nouvelle lecture de la criminalité qui fait désormais autorité à partir de 1880. Cette dernière se décline en deux chapitres auxquels il faut adapter la réponse répressive afin de conjurer au mieux les chiffres délivrés par la statistique judiciaire qui ne cessent depuis 1825 d'indiquer une hausse alarmante du nombre de délits produits en récidive. La relégation correspond ainsi au premier volet d'une réforme pénale qui envisage désormais les criminels et les délinquants en deux entités distinctes : les criminels et les délinquants de profession ou incorrigibles, ceux contre qui l'emprisonnement est totalement inutile et qui manifestent par la réitération de leurs crimes et de leurs délits leur incorrigibilité avérée, leur témébilité spéciale, et les criminels et les délinquants d'accident, ceux qui n'en sont qu'à leur première infraction et qu'il faut coûte que coûte préserver du contact corrupteur des prisons. Le dispositif mis en place à partir de 1881 contre la récidive par les républicains opportunistes consacre ainsi l'échec de l'option pénitentiaire et lui substitue une réponse originale qui s'articule autour d'une mesure d'élimination, la relégation promulguée le 27 mai 1885, et d'une mesure de prévention, la loi sur la libération conditionnelle promulguée le 14",['shs']
French Guiana. The Penal Colonization of French Guyana 1852-1953,"The penal colonization of French Guyana with convicts began in 1852. Officially, it began with the law of 30 May 1854 on the execution of the sentence of hard labor (called the law on transportation). Napoleon III (during the Second Empire), decided to establish the execution of the sentence of hard labor not within France, but in the colonies, specifically, in French Guyana. Previously, prisons where those convicted to the penalty of hard labor – either for a specific period or for life – served their time in port prisons of Brest, Toulon and Rochefort. The objective of this law, inspired by the penal settlement model implemented by Britain in Australia, was threefold: 1) it allowed the métropolis (France) to get rid of convicts (that is to say close the port prisons in France and avoid the risks of reoffending associated with released convicts); 2) it provided the colony with an abundant and cheap workforce while also allowing the most deserving convicts to settle when released; 3) it assisted in founding a settlement society and participating in the development of a part of the French colonial empire. To further this third objective, Article 6 of the Law on transportation created a "" doublage "" : transportés sentenced to less than eight years of hard labor were required at their release to remain in the colony a time equivalent to the duration of their sentence. Those sentenced to more than eight years had to remain in the colony for life. This allowed the prevention of the return of convicts to France and forced them to settle, temporarily or permanently, in the colony of French Guyana. The choice of French Guyana was not neutral. Most settlement attempts conducted in the eighteenth century with a free population resulted in failure. Very soon, because of its distance",['shs']

Computing capture tubes,"Many mobile robots such as wheeled robots, boats, or plane are described by nonholonomic differential equations. As a consequence, they have to satisfy some differential constraints such as having a radius of curvature for their trajectory lower than a known value. For this type of robots, it is difficult to prove some properties such as the avoidance of collisions with some moving obstacles. This is even more difficult when the initial condition is not known exactly or when some uncertainties occur. This paper proposes a method to compute an enclosure (a tube) for the trajectory of the robot in situations where a guaranteed interval integration cannot provide any acceptable enclosures. All properties that are satisfied by the tube (such as the non-collision) will also be satisfied by the actual trajectory of the robot.","['math', 'spi']"
Comparison of Variable Selection Methods for Time-to-Event Data in High-Dimensional Settings,"Over the last decades, molecular signatures have become increasingly important in oncology and are opening up a new area of personalized medicine. Nevertheless, biological relevance and statistical tools necessary for the development of these signatures have been called into question in the literature. Here, we investigate six typical selection methods for high-dimensional settings and survival endpoints, including LASSO and some of its extensions, component-wise boosting, and random survival forests (RSF). A resampling algorithm based on data splitting was used on nine high-dimensional simulated datasets to assess selection stability on training sets and the intersection between selection methods. Prognostic performances were evaluated on respective validation sets. Finally, one application on a real breast cancer dataset has been proposed. The false discovery rate (FDR) was high for each selection method, and the intersection between lists of predictors was very poor. RSF selects many more variables than the other methods and thus becomes less efficient on validation sets. Due to the complex correlation structure in genomic data, stability in the selection procedure is generally poor for selected predictors, but can be improved with a higher training sample size. In a very high-dimensional setting, we recommend the LASSO-pcvl method since it outperforms other methods by reducing the number of selected genes and minimizing FDR in most scenarios. Nevertheless, this method still gives a high rate of false positives. Further work is thus necessary to propose new methods to overcome this issue where numerous predictors are present. Pluridisciplinary discussion between clinicians and statisticians is necessary to ensure both statistical and biological relevance of the predictors included in molecular signatures.",['shs']
GEBCO Gridded Bathymetric Datasets for Mapping Japan Trench Geomorphology by Means of GMT Scripting Toolset,"The study investigated geomorphology of the Japan Trench located east of Japan, Pacific Ocean. A high-resolution GEBCO Gridded Bathymetric Dataset was used for modeling, mapping and visualization. The study aimed to compare and analyse variations in the geomorphic structures of the two parts of the trench and to visualize variations in the geological, geophysical and bathymetric settings. Technically, the cartographic work was performed using scripting based on the Generic Mapping Toolset (GMT). Modelled cross-sectioning orthogonal profiles transecting the trench in a perpendicular direction were automatically digitized and graphed in the two segments. The results of the bathymetric analysis shown that the southern part is shallower: with deeper values in absolute (139 samples between –7000 to –8000 m) and statistical records (the most frequent values are within –5500 to –5800 m) comparing to the northern segment (–5300 to –5500 m). The geomorphological analysis shows a more complicated relief in the northern part of the trench, which has a higher seismic activity. The southern part has a gentler slope on the Honshu island side. The geoid modeling along the trench ranges in 0–20 mGal. The highest values are recorded by the Honshu Island (>40 mGal). The rest of the area has rather moderate undulations (20–40 mGal). The free-air marine gravity of the Sea of Japan is <40 mGal. The results include 2D and 3D graphical models, thematic cartographic maps, spatial and statistical analysis of the Japan Trench geomorphology. Tested GMT functionality can be applied to future regional bathymetric modeling of the ocean trenches. All presented maps and graphs are made using GMT scripting toolset.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"

Generating Test Sequences to Assess the Performance of Elastic Cloud-based Systems,"Elasticity is one of the main features of cloud-based systems (CBS), where elastic adaptations, such as those to deal with scaling in or scaling out of computational resources, help to meet performance requirements under varying workload. There is an industrial need to find configurations of elastic adaptations and workload that could lead to degradation of performance in a CBS, serving possibly millions of users. However, the potentially great number of such configurations poses a challenge: executing and verifying all of them on the cloud can be prohibitively expensive in both, time and cost. We present an approach to model elasticity adaptation due to workload changes as a classification tree model and consequently generate short test sequences of configurations that cover all T-wise interactions between parameters in the model. These test sequences, when executed, help us to assess the performance of elastic CBS. Using MongoDB as a case study, test sequences generated by our approach reveal several significant performance degradations.",['info']
Assessing the safe yield of a karst aquifer by rainfall-discharge modelling.,"Assessing the safe yield of a karst aquifer by rainfall-discharge modelling. Groundwater flows and storage in karst aquifer are heterogeneous, deeply impacted by karst conduit network. Two main structures are usually used to described flows: matrix and conduits. This conceptual view of the aquifer is useful to reduce the karst hydrodynamic functioning to few parameters that can be modelled. Another main property of karst is the drainage of the aquifer by springs, connected to the karst network. Groundwater outflow can then be described by two components: baseflow and quickflow. Quickflow is mainly occurring during floods. Baseflow is the sustainable flow, varying between seasonal low and high flow, and during floods. Quickflow discharging at springs during flood is a part of the water budget that is not stored in the aquifer and is then not available for water supply. It results that groundwater availability at a spring, i.e. at the outlet of the aquifer, can be assessed by separating the quick and base flows. Studying a spring over years or decades gives insight the mean annual baseflow. We propose to define the safe yield that can be withdrawn from a karst aquifer close to the outlet as the mean inter-annual baseflow. For this purpose, lumped rainfall-discharge models are efficient tools to easily separate flow components from spring data. The modular karst modelling tool KarstMod is used in this study. This is a free open tool, made by the French National Karst Observatory Service. We focus on the Dardennes springs case study (South-East France). This aquifer is already used for water supply; twenty years of data are available. This is a typical karst aquifer, with huge flash flood up to 30 m 3 /s in few hours, and a mean total discharge close to 0.7 m 3 /s. We show that the mean annual baseflow is quite constant over the years while the rainfall is highly variable.","['sde', 'phys']"

Reconsidering the Cereal Chain Organization for Food and Green Chemistry,"Cereals are vital resources for a large number of human activities. Their different applications have led to the structuring of multiple chains: food chains (milling, baking,…), feed industries, starch industry, and more recently biofuels. All those sectors mobilize a range of different economic actors who are seeking to maximize their economic performances by adjusting their business models to the ability to produce, to add value and to respond to consumer preferences. Such a sector-oriented optimisation leads to striving for maximal production of the main product of each chain without taking into account the opportunities for by-products. Accordingly, this may result in our societies on one hand to a conflict of interest between cereal sub-sectors (as for example between food and fuel) which in turn reinforce competition between these sectors. On the other hand, this may lead to waste streams and insufficient usage of potentially valuable co-products. Moreover one should take into account population growth, food insecurity, increasing food related health issues, climate changes, pressure on fossil fuels, etc. A global solution is hard to reach, since one is dealing with balances between offers and demands by market prices. Such a balance is subjected to fluctuations inherent to agricultural production, which can cause highly significant price distortions and severe local problems. The alternative to this approach is to review the organization of the full cereal chain, from production to final enduses, with the aim to both optimize each of these individual supply chains as well as maximize the output of the entire system, locally and globally. Accordingly, a more holistic approach applied to the complexity of the full cereal system is required today. This paper will propose a combined local and global approach based on reverse engineering to reorganise cereal chains to better fulfil the different uses of cereal products.",['spi']
Pure range-only SLAM with indistinguishable landmarks; a constraint programming approach,"This paper deals with the simultaneous localization and mapping problem (SLAM) for a robot. The robot has to build a map of its environment while localizing itself using an the partially built map. It is assumed that (i) the map is made of punctual static landmarks, (ii) the landmarks are indistinguishable, (iii) the only exteroceptive measurements correspond to the distance between the robot and the landmarks. This problem can be takled using Monte-Carlo approaches, but the resulting method is often trapped in some local minimimum from which it is difficult to escape without solving the data association problem. The main contribution of this paper is to show that, due to the redundancy of measurements, a constraint-based approach can find a guaranteed enclosure of the global solution with a polynomial complexity. A simulated test-case is provided to illustrate the efficiency of the approach.",['spi']

Academic Outcomes in Language-Dependent and Computation-Dependent Courses among Mathematics Education Students in a Nigerian University: Top-Achievers Still Best of both Extremes,"In the field of mathematics education, there is an increased awareness of the need to account for the connection between mathematics and language. Despite the emphasis on this existing interconnectivity, students often erroneously distinguish themselves as better oriented to one extreme or the other. This study explores the pattern of academic performance of mathematics education students in language-dependent and computation-dependent courses. The study built on the Monitor Theory of second language acquisition to observe that school works existing as the practical result of learned language and grammar are among the reasons some students unnecessarily fear language-dependent courses. Ex-post facto research design was adopted to analyze the scores of 48 students enrolled in a programme in mathematics education at a university in North Central Nigeria. A total of 29 core courses across six (6) semesters were split into two dichotomous extremes of language-dependent and computation-dependent based on content and scope. Each student's scores were averaged across each category, with the absolute difference between the two averages taken as measure of achievement gap between the two extremes. A paired samples t-test of students average scores in the two categories indicates a statistically significant difference (t 0.05,47 = 7.3244, p = 0.000). Further analysis shows that 41.67% of the students are language-dependent, 2.08% computation-dependent, and 56.25% not dependent on any of the extremes. Additional analysis of variance (ANOVA) among three (3) identified performance categories reveals that the achievement gap differ significantly among bottom, middle and top achievers, with the mean achievement gap lowest among top Achievers. The findings of this study stressed the reality of inherent and superficial categorization based on the two extremes among mathematics education students. The interpretation of the findings in terms of students' unique orientation and mindset towards mathematics education were also discussed. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that future works may consider introducing corroborative information about participant's inclination toward the two extremes to strengthen eventual placement from attainment scores.","['math', 'shs']"

LLR Computation for Multistage Decoding,"Due to their linear and highly symmetrical structure , lattices are becoming of a great interest as potential transmission schemes. Lattice codes suggest a common view of channel and source coding and new tools for the analysis of information network problems. Several constructions have been proposed to build these lattices, some of which are based on multi-level coding and multistage decoding such as constructions D and πD. Soft-decision decoders corresponding to the different nested error-correcting codes used to construct such lattices need at each stage the computation of a soft input, namely Log-Likelihood Ratios. In this paper, we give an efficient computation of LLRs based on Jacobi theta functions for three different types of constructions; Binary construction D, Quaternary construction D and Binary construction πD.",['info']
Intensional Data on the Web,"We call data intensional when it is not directly available, but must be accessed through a costly interface. Intensional data naturally arises in a number of Web data management scenarios, such as Web crawling or ontology-based data access. Such scenarios require us to model an uncertain view of the world, for which, given a query, we must answer the question “What is the best thing to do next?” Once data has been retrieved, the knowledge of the world is revised, and the whole process is repeated, until enough knowledge about the world has been obtained for the particular application considered. In this article, we give an overview of the steps underlying all intensional data management scenarios, and illustrate them on three concrete applications: focused crawling, online influence maximization in social networks, and mining crowdsourced data.",['info']
Irrigation retrieval from Landsat optical/thermal data integrated into a crop water balance model: A case study over winter wheat fields in a semi-arid region,"Monitoring irrigation is essential for an efficient management of water resources in arid and semi-arid regions. We propose to estimate the timing and the amount of irrigation throughout the agricultural season using optical and thermal Landsat-7/8 data. The approach is implemented in four steps: i) partitioning the Landsat land surface temperature (LST) to derive the crop water stress coefficient (Ks), ii) estimating the daily root zone soil moisture (RZSM) from the integration of Landsat-derived Ks into a crop water balance model, iii) retrieving irrigation at the Landsat pixel scale and iv) aggregating pixel-scale irrigation estimates at the crop field scale. The new irrigation retrieval method is tested over three agricultural areas during four seasons and is evaluated over five winter wheat fields under different irrigation techniques (drip, flood and no-irrigation). The model is very accurate for the seasonal accumulated amounts (R ~ 0.95 and RMSE ~ 44 mm). However, lower agreements with observed irrigations are obtained at the daily scale. To assess the performance of the irrigation retrieval method over a range of time periods, the daily predicted and observed 2 irrigations are cumulated from 1 to 90 days. Generally, acceptable errors (R = 0.52 and RMSE = 27 mm) are obtained for irrigations cumulated over 15 days and the performance gradually improves by increasing the accumulation period, depicting a strong link to the frequency of Landsat overpasses (16 days or 8 days by combining Landsat-7 and-8). Despite the uncertainties in retrieved irrigations at daily to weekly scales, the daily RZSM and evapotranspiration simulated from the retrieved daily irrigations are estimated accurately and are very close to those estimated from actual irrigations. This research demonstrates the utility of high spatial resolution optical and thermal data for estimating irrigation and consequently for better closing the water budget over agricultural areas. We also show that significant improvements can be expected at daily to weekly time scales by reducing the revisit time of high-spatial resolution thermal data, as included in the TRISHNA future mission requirements.",['sde']
Methane storage capacity of the early Martian cryosphere,"Methane is a key molecule to understand the habitability of Mars due to its possible biological origin and short atmospheric lifetime. Recent methane detections on Mars present a large variability that is probably due to relatively localized sources and sink processes yet unknown. In this study, we determine how much methane could have been abiotically produced by early Mars serpentinization processes that could also explain the observed martian remanent magnetic field. Under the assumption of a cold early Mars environment, a cryosphere could trap such methane as clathrates in stable form at depth. The extent and spatial distribution of these methane reservoirs have been calculated with respect to the magnetization distribution and other factors. We calculate that the maximum storage capacity of such a clathrate cryosphere is about 2.1×1019 - 2.2×1020 moles of CH4, which can explain sporadic releases of methane that have been observed on the surface of the planet during the past decade (∼1.2×109 moles). This amount of trapped methane is sufficient for similar sized releases to have happened yearly during the history of the planet. While the stability of such reservoirs depends on many factors that are poorly constrained, it is possible that they have remained trapped at depth until the present day. Due to the possible implications of methane detection for life and its influence on the atmospheric and climate processes on the planet, confirming the sporadic release of methane on Mars and the global distribution of its sources is one of the major goals of the current and next space missions to Mars.",['phys']
"Drought: Observed trends, future projectionsSécheresses : tendances observées, projections futures","Drought quantification is difficult since a drought is usually identified by its effects or by its impacts on different types of systems, but no single physical variable can be measured to quantify drought. Droughts are also difficult to pinpoint in time and space since their onset, ending, duration, magnitude, and spatial extent are not easy to define. Thus, drought is often quantified indirectly using indices, which are often based on meteorological, hydrological and/or remote sensing data, and physical models help us understand the relevant processes and make predictions. In this sub-chapter, we describe and discuss drought in the Mediterranean together with some relevant processes, and comment on possible future scenarios.",['sde']
Toward an AlGaAs/AlOx near-infrared integrated optical parametric oscillator,"We report on the observation of self-amplified parametric downconversion in a selectively oxidized AlGaAs cavity that was designed to perform as a guided-wave optical parametric oscillator in the near infrared. To date, two technological factors preclude such oscillation and are thoroughly investigated here: oxidation-induced optical propagation losses and the reflectivity of the waveguide resonator facets. The spectral study of the former has singled out two distinct mechanisms: scattering at the oxide interfaces and absorption by point defects in the oxide neighboring layers. Regarding the latter, dielectric mirrors have been designed and deposited on the ridge waveguide facets, with modal reflectivities of ∼10% at pump wavelength and ∼90% at signal/idler wavelengths. With respect to the case of a mirrorless waveguide, the monolithic cavity enabled a factor-2 enhancement of the conversion efficiency, indicating the close proximity of the oscillation threshold.",['spi']

Microstructure Characterization of a Nitrided Fe- 3wt.%Cr-0.3wt.%C Model Alloy by Anomalous Small Angle X-ray Scattering,"Nitriding is a thermo-chemical surface treatment of steels providing an improved fatigue and wear resistance. This treatment is based on nitrogen diffusion involving the precipitation of nano-scaled nitrides from the solid solution at the near surface of the nitrided piece. Nitriding involves a complex microstructural evolution both in time and depth including diffusion of nitrogen and precipitation of nitrides but also coarsening and dissolution of carbides resulting in diffusion of carbon. However the chemical composition of nano-scaled precipitates remains controversial, in particular regarding the iron content in nano-nitrides that may substitute alloying elements. In this framework, anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering was used to bring quantitative data on the distribution and composition of the nano-scaled phases in a Fe-3Cr-0.3C steel as a function of depth.","['spi', 'phys']"
Activation of surfaces prior to gaseous nitriding of a 3wt.% Cr carbon iron-based alloy,"Gaseous nitriding is a well-established thermochemical treatment of carbon iron-based alloys that considerably enhances corrosion, wear and fatigue resistances of critical mechanical parts such as crank shafts and bearings. It is based on the diffusion of nitrogen atoms from the catalytic decomposition of ammonia at the outer surface. The process has generally been relying on the fast development of a compound layer that mainly serves as a nitrogen reserve during the treatment. The growth of the compound layer directly depends on the adsorption of nitrogen atoms at the surface of treated parts. Any barriers to the nitrogen adsorption may induce detrimental kinetics of nitriding, and so a lack of mechanical properties. So-called surface preparations prior to nitriding thus fundamentally assist with (i) nitriding of superior quality (i.e. with the required properties such as the effective depth and mechanical properties), (ii) uniform nitriding of the whole treated part (i.e. no mechanical heterogeneities induced by the process) and (iii) repeatable nitriding from batch to batch. The present work deals with three in-situ surface activation solutions prior to nitriding that are oxidation, urea and ammonium chloride. Pre-treatments are compared based on their efficiency on uncleaned samples, defined by different degrees of residues of water dissolved machining oil, to be nitrided. The first few hours of nitriding are reported on a 3wt.%Cr carbon iron-base alloy.","['spi', 'phys', 'chim']"
Optimization of gaseous nitriding of steels by multi-physics modelling,"Gaseous nitriding is controlled by temperature, time and surface nitrogen potential. Tuning these parameters lead to the expected mechanical properties (hardness, residual stresses) and durability of treated mechanical parts. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to optimize nitriding parameters by using a multi-physics modelling of the nitriding treatment (microstructure, diffusion/precipitation mechanisms, hardness and residual stress generation). This model is particularly suited to the diffusion layer and does not apply to the compound layer. The scope concerns low-alloyed carbon steels and gaseous nitriding. The role of carbon is established and taken into account in the proposed methodology.","['phys', 'spi', 'chim']"
Residual stress development during nitriding of steels,"Nitriding is a well-established thermochemical surface treatment of carbon micro-alloyed steels aiming enhancing surface properties such as fatigue, wear and corrosion resistances. The idea is taking benefits from the high hardening level due to a fine nitride precipitation and also the compressive residual stress state. Due to some complex interactions of phenomena during nitriding, the last has not been completely explained yet. When interest is focused on stress depth gradient and time evolution, difficulties find origins in pronounced heterogeneities whether it is the chemical gradient due to nitrogen diffusion, the resulting gradient of microstructure or the gradient of volumetric misfits. Relaxation of residual stresses is so usually described using a thermally controlled creep phenomenon due to the couple of diffusion and stress, but depend on phenomenological descriptions. A key point is also disregard that is the diffusion of carbon and its redistribution across the nitrided surface during the treatment. Based on experimental characterizations of model carbon iron-based alloys, the role of phase transformations, especially carbides, is explored in order to give better understandings of the residual stress development during nitriding.",['spi']
Phase transformations and induced volume changes in a nitrided ternary Fe–3%Cr–0.345%C alloy,"Phase transformations during nitriding of a ternary carbon iron-based alloy Fe–3%Cr–0.345%C were studied, aiming for a better understanding of residual stresses generation and evolution. The relationship between the precipitation of Cr7C3 carbides and CrN nitrides, the induced volume change and the mechanical properties were investigated at three distinct depths of the diffusion zone. The relaxation of residual stresses arose through phase transformations according to the diffusion of nitrogen but also of carbon.","['phys', 'spi', 'chim']"

Metallographic and x-ray diffraction studies and thermodynamic computations are performed.",['phys']
Phase transormations involving residual stresses during gaseous nitriding of steel,"Nitriding of steels is an important treatment in duplex hardening methods. This treatment is known in the art but some advances still need to be done in terms of residual stress understanding. Although residual stresses originate from volume micro-loading accompanying the precipitation of nitrides, questions about their in-depth distribution of a nitrided layer during the treatment are still a challenge. A chemico-thermo-micromechanical model has been developed on the volume change computation of secondary phase transformation. Supported by some experimental observations (TEM, X-ray analysis, Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA), ...), this model gives some better understanding about nitriding. Residual stresses are mainly due to the precipitation of semi-coherent MN nitrides (M=Cr,V,Mo,. . . ). Moreover carbon, often not enough considered in the literature, is shown to be of importance in the process as it involves a second type of precipitation that is the transformation of carbides M23C6 and M7C3 into incoherent nitrides. The definition of the volume change of this transformation is a critical entry data of the mechanical modelling.","['phys', 'spi', 'chim']"
Influence of strain hardening on gaseous nitriding of steels,"Machining is known to introduce plastic straining and residual stress gradients in surface of mechanical parts. If not controlled, the mechanical state of a surface can influence adsorption and diffusion of atoms during subsequent chemical surface treatments, such as nitriding. In the present work, the influence of strain hardening on gaseous nitriding of steels is studied. The nitriding process was carried out using a laboratory set-up enabling the control of nitriding parameters (time, temperature, nitriding potential) on 33CrMoV12-9 steel samples. Homogeneously strain hardened samples are obtained by controlled tensile tests, enabling to nitride samples at different levels of strengthening. Results are compared to a reference state, obtained from tensile specimen not submitted to strain-hardening, as well as an industrially representative sample nitrided using the same conditions. Nitrided samples are characterized by SEM observations, hardness measurements and carbon and nitrogen in-depth concentration profiles.","['chim', 'spi']"

Results are correlated with the characterization of a ternary Fe-C-3w.%Cr alloy nitrided at 550°C for various time. Residual stress-depth analyses are carried out by X-rays diffraction.

SAGA GIS for information extraction on presence and conditions of vegetation of northern coast of Iceland based on the Landsat TM,"The paper aims to evaluate the presence and condition of vegetation by SAGA GIS. The study area covers northern coasts of Iceland including two fjords, the Eyjafjörður and the Skagafjörður, prosperous agricultural regions. The vegetation coverage in Iceland experience the impact of harsh climate, land use, livestock grazing, glacial ablation and volcanism. The data include the Landsat TM image. The methodology is based on computing raster bands for simulating Tassel Cap Transformation (wetness, greenness and brightness) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) sensitive to high biomass. The results include modelled three bands of brightness, greenness and wetness. Greenness variation shows the least values in ice-covered areas (-56.98 to-18.69). High values (-23.48 to 9.12) are in the valleys with dense vegetation, correlating with the geomorphology of the river network, the vegetation-free areas and ocean which corresponds to the peak of 30.87 to 41.19. The bell-shaped data distribution shows frequency 43.19-141.74 for vegetation indicating healthy state and canopy density. Maximal values are in ice-covered regions and glaciers (64°N-65°N). Very low values (0 to-20) show desertification and mountainous rocks. Moderate values (20-40) indicate healthy vegetation. The most frequent data:-28,17 to 11,8. The EVI shows data variations (-0.14 to 0.04). The study contributes both to the regional studies of Arctic Iceland and methodological approach of remote sensing data processing by SAGA GIS.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"

A microscopic model beyond mean-field: from giant resonance properties to the fit of new effective interactions,"A completely microscopic beyond mean-field approach has been elaborated to overcome some intrinsic limitations of self-consistent mean-field schemes applied to nuclear systems, such as the incapability to produce some properties of single-particle states (e.g. spectroscopic factors), as well as of collective states (e.g. their damping width and their gamma decay to the ground state or to low lying states). Since commonly used effective interactions are fitted at the mean-field level, one should aim at refitting them including the desired beyond mean-field contributions in the refitting procedure. If zero-range interactions are used, divergences arise. We present some steps towards the refitting of Skyrme interactions, for its application in finite nuclei.",['phys']
Tensor and tensor-isospin terms in the effective Gogny interaction,"We discuss the need of including tensor terms in the effective Gogny interaction used in mean-field calculations. We show in one illustrative case that, with the usual tensor term that is employed in the Skyrme interaction (and that allows us to separate the like-nucleon and the neutron-proton tensor contributions), we can describe the evolution of the N=28 neutron gap in calcium isotopes. We propose to include a tensor and a tensor-isospin term in finite-range interactions of Gogny type. The parameters of the two tensor terms allow us to treat separately the like-nucleon and the neutron-proton contributions. Two parameterizations of the tensor terms have been chosen to reproduce different neutron single-particle properties in the 48Ca nucleus and the energy of the first 0- state in the 16O nucleus. By employing these two parameterizations we analyze the evolution of the N=14, 28, and 90 neutron energy gaps in oxygen, calcium and tin isotopes, respectively. We show that the combination of the parameters governing the like-nucleon contribution is crucial to correctly reproduce the experimental (where available) or shell-model trends for the evolution of the three neutron gaps under study.",['phys']
From equilibrium lamellae to out-of-equilibrium cylinders in triblock copolymer nanolayers obtained via multilayer coextrusion,"Multilayer coextrusion was used to obtain nanolayered films of self-assembled commercial triblock copolymer poly(methyl methacrylate-b-butyl acrylate-b-methyl methacrylate) (MAM) confined by poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The MAM layer thickness was varied from 30 nm to 500 nm (i.e. roughly 1 to 15–20 nanodomains) by changing either the number of multiplying elements or the chill roll draw ratio. The as-extruded triblock morphology within the layers was identified as cylindrical using transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Surprisingly, this differs from the lamellar morphology identified at equilibrium in bulk and thin films for this triblock. Moreover, as the triblock layer thickness is decreased, the triblock morphology is constrained into a preferential orientation. Slightly different packings were observed on films with similar layer thicknesses but achieved with different processing routes. This one-step and industrially scalable method allowing long-range control of the self-assembly is of interest for engineering applications with large quantity of materials needed.","['chim', 'spi']"
Numerical Modelling of Hydrokinetic Turbines Immersed in Complex Topography using Non-Rotative Actuator Discs,"Recent studies have pointed out the potential of several coastal or river areas to provide significant energy resources in the near future. However, technological processes for extracting energy using Marine Current Energy Converters (MCEC) are not generically ""field-ready"" and still require significant research to be set up. The present work comes within this framework: we develop the numerical model OceaPoS, useful to carry out a comprehensive description of turbulent flow patterns past MCEC and forward optimize the turbine arrays configurations and evaluate their environmental effects. The OceaPos model consists in describing the fluid as an ensemble of Lagrangian particles ruled by a Stochastic process. OceaPos follows the same methodology than SDM-WindPoS model for wind farm simulations and adapts the Lagrangian stochastic downscaling method (SDM) of Bossy et al.

Autonomic computing in manufacturing process coordination in industry 4.0 contextCalcul autonome dans la coordination des processus de fabrication dans le contexte de l'industrie 4.0,"Industry 4.0 is defined as a paradigm that integrates the latest technological inventions in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Communication, and Information technologies, among other domains. This integration is made to increase the levels of automation, efficiency, and productivity of production, in manufacturing and industrial processes. In particular, the actors of the production processes (Things, Data, People and Services) should autonomously be able to act and make decisions, to implement self-* properties, such as self-configuration, self-management, and self-healing. In that sense, the Industry 4.0 revolution introduces many new challenges and issues that need to be solved. Some of those challenges are related to the integration of the heterogeneous actors that carry out the manufacturing process's tasks. Moreover, it is crucial to determine how to permit the actors to self-manage the production processes. In this paper, we present a framework for the integration of autonomous processes based on the needs for coordination, cooperation, and collaboration. Notably, we define three autonomic cycles that allow the actors of manufacturing processes (Data, People, Things, and Services) to interoperate. These autonomic cycles can create a coordinated plan for self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing during the manufacturing process. In this way, the actors can be appropriately coordinated, oriented to autonomously manufacture Smart Products, detect failures, and recover from errors or failures, among other things.",['info']
Dynamic competition with network externalities: how history matters,"We consider dynamic competition among platforms in a market with network externalities. A platform that dominated the market in the previous period becomes “focal” in the current period, in that agents play the equilibrium in which they join the focal platform whenever such equilibrium exists. Yet when faced with higher‐quality competition, can a low‐quality platform remain focal? In the finite‐horizon case, the unique equilibrium is efficient for “patient” platforms; with an infinite time horizon, however, there are multiple equilibria where either the low‐ or high‐quality platform dominates. If qualities are stochastic, the platform with a better average quality wins with a higher probability, even when its realized quality is lower, and this probability increases as platforms become more patient. Hence, social welfare may decline as platforms become more forward looking.",['shs']
"Metal–Organic Frameworks from Divalent Metals and 1,4-Benzenedicarboxylate with Bidentate Pyridine- N -oxide Co-ligands","Two Co2+ metal-organic framework materials, constructed from a combination of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) and either 2,2'-dipyridyl-N-oxide (DPNO) or 2,2'-dipyridyl-N,N'-dioxide (DPNDO), are synthesized under solvothermal reaction conditions, and their structures solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Both have three-dimensional structures that contain octahedral Co2+ centers with mu 2-(eta(2))-BDC, and bidentate DPNO or DPNDO coligands that bridge pairs of metal centers but do not contribute toward the overall connectivity of the framework. Co-3(BDC)(3)(DPNO)(2) contains trimers of trans corner-shared Co-centered octahedra with one type of bridging BDC ligand forming terminal edges of the trimers, bridging to neighboring trimer units, and a second type, bridging pairs of metals and also connecting neighboring trimers. Co-2(BDC)(2)(DPNDO) is constructed from one-dimensional inorganic chains consisting of cis- and trans-corner shared Co2+-centered octahedra. The DPNDO ligand is bis-bidentate, forming the edges of one type of octahedron and the trans corners of the second type, with the coordination for both octahedra completed by bridging BDC linkers, which in turn connect the inorganic chains to yield a three-dimensional structure. Thermogravimetric analysis shows both materials contain trapped solvent, and while Co-3(BDC)(3)(DPNO)(2) is unstable with respect to solvent loss, Co-2(BDC)(2)(DPNDO), and its magnesium analogue, can be desolvated to yield permanently porous materials that show thermal stability up to 300 degrees C. For Co-2(BDC)(2)(DPNDO), gas adsorption studies show permanent microporosity with moderate uptake of small gas molecules (N-2, CO2, CH4, and C2H6), supported by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo calculations based on the assumption of rigid crystal structures, while gravimetric analysis shows rapid and reversible methanol adsorption at ambient pressure for both the Co and Mg analogues of the framework.",['chim']

"Carnets de voyage, collection.","Sous forme de journaux intimes, de mémoires, de lettres adressées à un interlocuteur plus ou moins fictif (en réalité le lecteur), la littérature de voyage est un genre en soi qui, depuis plusieurs siècles, remporte un vif succès. Songeons seulement au Journal du Voyage de Michel de Montaigne en Italie par la Suisse et l’Allemagne en 1580 & 1581, ou encore au Voyage en Italie (Italienische Reise) de Goethe (1786-87), textes qui fournissent aujourd’hui des témoignages précieux non seulement sur les goûts de l’auteur, mais aussi sur les coutumes des villes et des pays traversés. La littérature de voyage reste à notre époque un genre très prisé, certains écrivains s’en faisant même une spécialité. Carnets de voyage où l’on écrit, l’on dessine, l’on peint, l’on colle, souvent document artisanal qui n’a pas vocation à être publié, supports d’une expression personnelle, originale et intime, moyens d’échanges et de rencontres avec d’autres personnes, à une époque où les technologies envahissantes (téléphones portables, appareils photos numériques, vidéos, tablettes, ordinateurs, réseaux sociaux) sont davantage associées au monde du travail et du quotidien qu’elles ne portent le rêve enchanté qu’offre le voyage et qui nous attire vers l’ailleurs. Loin des guides touristiques conventionnels, nos Carnets de voyage sont des textes courts et personnels, tantôt des pages arrachées à des récits d’écrivains, de musiciens et d’artistes du passé qui visitèrent des villes aussi mythiques que Venise, Saint-Pétersbourg, New York ou Buenos Aires - sans exclure des lieux plus secrets aux charmes non moins fascinants -, tantôt des récits d’auteurs et poètes contemporains, amateurs de dépaysement, de curiosités, de rencontres qui ont cherché à saisir une émotion, un moment intime et vivant de leur voyage.

SecFuNet : Embedded Framwork in OpenSSL to support Smart Cards,"Smartcards are becoming increasingly popular as a means for personal identification and authentication in many secure application areas such as e-Banking and e-Commerce. Millions of users have a smart card in their pocket without even knowing it. The SecFuNet project proposes solutions for integrating secure microcontrollers in order to develop a security framework for Cloud Computing and virtual environment. This framework introduces, among its many services: authentication and authorization functions for virtual environments, based on Remote Grid of Secure Elements (RG0SE). The objective is to implement an open standard framework, based on smart cards and OpenSSL. This framework provides TLS secure channels for establishing trust relationships among Users, Virtual Machines (VMs), Hypervisor (XEN) and RG0SE. The authentication is done directly between smart cards (owned by users or associated to VM) and SecFuNet Identity Management (IdM). This framework concerns a highly secure authentication with secure microcontrollers allowing users' (or VMs') strong mutual authentication with SecFuNet Services and provides some libraries to the developers. It defines and describes the features and the modules added to OpenSSL in order to supply easily the Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) -described by the ISO 7816 standard -transferred to smart cards.",['info']
Poisson Access Networks with Shadowing: Modelling and Statistical Inference,"Since interference is the main performance-limiting factor in most wireless networks, it is crucial to characterize the interference statistics. The two main determinants of the interference are the network geometry (spatial distribution of concurrently transmitting nodes) and the path loss law (signal attenuation). In order to explain the above, the main purpose of this thesis is of study the path-loss with respect to the serving base stations (BS) and the interference factor, defined as the ratio of the sum of the path-gains from interfering BS to the path-gain from the serving BS. In this thesis, the locations of nodes are modeled as a random Poisson process. Regarding the signal propagation model, we consider a random shadowing that characterizes in a statistical manner the effect of var- ious obstacles. We provide results on the probability distribution function of both the path-loss and the interference factors.",['math']

« Health » potential of pasta: towards an improvement of nutritional properties?,"Ms. Valérie MICARD detailed the nutritional interest of pasta, more particularly in relation with starch and proteins. As the penetration rate of pasta in French homes is high (96% for dry pasta), pasta are a good nutritional vector. Pasta are a major source of carbohydrates, for which an increase of consumption is required, and have a low glycemic and insulin indexes leading to positive health impacts. The glycemic index (GI) partly depends on food structure. How is the GI impacted if pasta structure is changed (for example by a process modification or by the introduction of other ingredients than durum wheat)? It was demonstrated an effect on GI and pasta structure of high and ultra-high temperatures of drying on in vitro analysis, however results were not significant in vivo. Regarding proteins, it is not well-known that protein content of pasta is relatively high (12-15% dry matter). However, pasta lack some essential amino acid (e.g. lysine). Inspired from the Mediterranean Diet and other traditional recipes in the world, recent research works were conducted to elaborate “mixed pasta” made of durum wheat semolina and legumes flour (e.g. bean flour). Pasta containing 35% of bean and 65% of durum wheat are richer in proteins, fibers and minerals compared to 100% durum wheat-based pasta. GI and insulin index ae still low and the essential amino acid balance is better in the case of mixed pasta. Ms. MICARD explained how and under which conditions protein-enriched foods are interesting for elderly persons and explained the distinction between slow and fast-acting proteins. It is of primary importance to continue to acquire knowledge on the “formulation-process/structure/physiological effects” relation. Other ways for improving pasta nutritional properties are linked to the addition of fibers, antioxidants or to the fermentation process (notably for the gluten free products).Mme Valérie MICARD a présenté les intérêts nutritionnels des pâtes, et expliqué le lien avec leur composition (quantité d’amidon et qualité-quantité des protéines). Dans la mesure où le taux de pénétration des pâtes dans les foyers français est élevé (96% pour les pâtes sèches), les pâtes sont un bon vecteur nutritionnel. Elles constituent la principale source de glucides, dont la consommation en France reste inférieure aux recommandations, et ont des index glycémique et insulinémique bas à l’origine d’impacts positifs sur la santé. L’index glycémique (IG) dépend en partie de la structure de l’aliment. Ainsi comment l’IG est-il impacté si la structure des pâtes est modifiée (par exemple suite à une modification du procédé de fabrication ou à l’introduction d’autres ingrédients que le blé dur) ? Il a été montré un effet sur l’IG et la structure des pâtes du séchage à haute et très haute températures sur des analyses in vitro. Toutefois les résultats ne se sont pas révélés significatifs in vivo. En ce qui concerne les protéines, il est en fait peu connu que les pâtes ont une teneur en protéines relativement élevée (12-15% matière sèche). Toutefois, les pâtes manquent de certains acides aminés indispensables (e.g. la lysine). Inspirés de la diète méditerranéenne et d’autres recettes traditionnelles à travers le monde, des travaux de recherche récents ont été conduits pour élaborer des « pâtes mixtes » contenant de la semoule de blé dur et de la farine de légumineuses (ex. farine de fèves). Les pâtes contenant 35% de fèves et 65% de blé dur sont plus riches en protéines, fibres et minéraux comparés à celles contenant uniquement du blé dur. Les index glycémique et insulinémique sont toujours bas et l’équilibre en acides aminés indispensables est amélioré dans le cas des pâtes mixtes. Mme MICARD a expliqué comment et sous quelles conditions les aliments enrichis en protéines sont intéressantes pour les personnes âgées et a expliqué la distinction entre les protéines rapides et lentes. Il est nécessaire de continuer à acquérir des connaissances sur la relation « formule procédé/ structure/effets physiologiques ». D’autres voies qui permettraient d’améliorer les propriétés nutritionnelles des pâtes sont : l’ajout de fibres ou d’antioxydants ou l’introduction d’une étape de fermentation (notamment pour des produits sans gluten).",['sdv']
Enhanced S-MAC Protocol for Early Reaction and Detection in Wireless Video Sensor Networks,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) continue their ascending developement to be among the leaders of technology. Furthermore, images are of paramount importance in several applications based on WSNs. Capturing, processing and transmitting the image face several challenges, mainly because of their highly needed power consumption. The huge number of images sensed and transmitted in a Wireless Video Sensor Network (WVSN) increases the dataflow on the overall network. A WVSN consists of three different layers: the video-sensor node, the coordinator and the sink. Sending images at the same time from different sensor nodes to a coordinator causes several problems. Besides energy consumption and bandwidth usage that represent the two major challenges in WSN, the queue of images on the coordinator can cause slower detection of intrusions and thus slower reaction from the coordinator. These reasons increase the need of a mac-layer protocol to control the network. We propose a new modified communication protocol based on the S-MAC protocol. This solution consists of adding a priority bit to the S-MAC protocol. Our approach is validated by experimentation using raspberry pi 3 and by simulation in OMNET++.",['info']

Toward viability and adaptive governance of tropical islands agrosystems,"GAIA-TROP project contributes to identify and analyze socio-technical conditions for the implementation of agroecological transition in the French Caribbean. We wonder about adaptive capacities of these areas facing exacerbated global changes. The move from a high-yield farming system to a more viable farming system based on natural resources and social interactions has become one of the major issue and challenge for agronomic research. The FAO (2010) supports the end of the productionist model and claims for “smart agriculture” principles which are environmentally friendly. In this context, agroecological transition may be considered as a privileged pathway. Our approach assumes that this transition comes from the ability of all stakeholders (farmers and institutional stakeholders) to build a common paradigm on farming systems’ viability. This can be initiated through participatory approaches leading each stakeholder to transform their production systems. Our aim is to create a decision support tool dedicated to agriculture in an island context in order to better understand agrosystems. This tool will help decisions to ensure viability in the reality of global changes and other types of uncertainty.",['sdv']

"Definitions, references and interpretations of the concept of multifunctionality in France","The research work on multifunctionality in France is being carried out by a variety of epistemologic communities, with a wide range of research questions and methods. The purpose of this paper is to identify these communities, their different uses of the concept of multifunctionality, and the types of agriculture it refers to. The functions to be promoted and the way to enhance them can be related to the theoretical framework used. Six main types of epistemic communities are identified in the French literature, defied y a common view on the functions of agriculture, and scientific approach. Some research gaps in French literature are suggested. The way to convert the principles of multifunctionality or the principles of sustainable development into farm policy principles particular is a matter of interest. More empirical research is also needed to characterize multifunctionality, including divergent perceptions and valuations by different stakeholder groups.",['shs']
"A viability model of farming systems, the case of French West Indies","One the aims of the multidisciplinary research project Gaia-Trop on viability and adaptive management of small tropical islands agro-systems, was to devise a new model of farm system using tools of the mathematical viability theory. It has been constructed in close cooperation with French West Indies farmers to take into account their needs and expectations. The main emerging points focused on soil degradation, pest disease and climatic risks and economic constraints. A specific software is being developed for the viability calculus that will be made available for this community. We present first insights of this model and results obtained for only one parcel and without taking uncertainties at this stage. lt highlights that the objective of restoring the soil quality in the long term can be unstainable for farmers facing with financial constraints. The issue of sharing the costs of the agro-ecological transition must be asked.",['sdv']

A Bandwidth Marketplace for Heterogeneous Mobile Networks,"In recent years, with the evolution of new and content-rich Internet services, mobile network operators face the challenging task to guarantee ubiquitous and seamless access to their customers, while minimizing the installation and operating costs of their network. On the other hand, in residential areas most of the network capacity that residential users lease from ISP for Internet access remains unexploited. Mobile network operators can therefore rent the unexploited capacity of residential user access devices (e.g., wireless access points or femtocells) when the traffic demand of their mobile customers exceeds the operator's network capacity. To minimize the leasing costs for the use of the capacity made available by residential users and prevent market manipulation, we formulate the allocation mechanism as a combinatorial reverse auction, which guarantees that all users reveal their real price for the utilization of their wireless access points.",['info']
Perovskites as potential UV photoinitiators for radical and cationic polymerizations,"Four perovskites (LaTiO3, LaCrO3, La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 and MAPbI3) are proposed here as new photoinitiators (e.g., free radical generators) in combination with iodonium salt and optionally another additive (N-vinylcarbazole—NVK) to initiate both radical and cationic photopolymerization reactions. The proposed systems are efficient phenyl radical generators under polychromatic light sources such as a halogen lamp or a Xe–Hg lamp. The interest of this approach is the ability to work with very stable inorganic structures as photoinitiators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that perovskites are incorporated in photoinitiating systems. Photochemical mechanisms will be proposed as sustained by electron spin resonance spin trapping (ESR-ST) experiments.",['chim']

"Safety assessment of the process ‘Coexpan Montonate’, based on Starlinger Decon technology, used to recycle post‐consumer PET into food contact materials","This scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of the recycling process Coexpan Montonate (EU register No RECYC0141), which is based on the Starlinger Decon technology. The decontamination efficiency of the process was demonstrated by a challenge test. The input of this process is washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, mainly bottles, containing no more than 5% of PET from non-food consumer applications. In this technology, washed and dried PET flakes are preheated before being submitted to solid-state polycondensation (SSP) in a continuous reactor at high temperature under vacuum and gas flow. Having examined the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the preheating (step 2) and the decontamination in the continuous SSP reactor (step 3) are the critical steps that determine the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters that control their performance are well defined and are temperature, pressure, residence time and gas flow for step 2 and 3. Under these conditions, it was demonstrated that the recycling process under evaluation, using the Starlinger Decon technology, is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0.1 lg/kg food. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the recycled PET obtained from this process intended to be used up to 100% for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long-term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill, is not considered of safety concern. Trays made of this PET are not intended to be used, and should not to be used in microwave and conventional ovens.",['sdv']
Computer-Aided Verification for Mechanism Design,"In mechanism design, the gold standard solution concepts are dominant strategy incentive compatibility and Bayesian incentive compatibility. These solution concepts relieve the (possibly unsophisticated) bidders from the need to engage in complicated strategizing. While incentive properties are simple to state, their proofs are specific to the mechanism and can be quite complex. This raises two concerns. From a practical perspective, checking a complex proof can be a tedious process, often requiring experts knowledgeable in mechanism design. Furthermore, from a modeling perspective, if unsophisticated agents are unconvinced of incentive properties, they may strategize in unpredictable ways. To address both concerns, we explore techniques from computer-aided verification to construct formal proofs of incentive properties. Because formal proofs can be automatically checked, agents do not need to manually check the properties, or even understand the proof. To demonstrate, we present the verification of a sophisticated mechanism: the generic reduction from Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism design to algorithm design given by Hartline, Kleinberg, and Malekian. This mechanism presents new challenges for formal verification, including essential use of randomness from both the execution of the mechanism and from the prior type distributions. As an immediate consequence, our work also formalizes Bayesian incentive compatibility for the entire family of mechanisms derived via this reduction. Finally, as an intermediate step in our formalization, we provide the first formal verification of incentive compatibility for the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism.",['info']
Preliminary 3D Modelling of Structural behaviour of Face Bolting and Umbrella Arch in Tunneling,"Umbrella arch and face bolting are two reinforcement technics used in tunnelling (NATM conventional tunnelling), especiallyfor low-depth tunnels (H/D=1 to 5) in poorly consolidated soils. The arch is built by setting pipes around the contour line of thetunnel face prior to excavation, while bolting consists in setting and sealing long berglass or metallic rods at the tunnel face.The bolts provide improved mechanical properties to the ground that is to be excavated and they are gradually destroyed asthe excavation progresses, whereas the arch brings stability to the whole face area and is left as a permanent reinforcement.In this context, 3D modelling of these tunnels and their reinforcement is essential to predict surface settlements and animportant tool to validate appropriate tunnel designs.",['spi']
Optimal Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Integrating Logical Constraints: An MIQP Perspective,"This paper considers the problem of optimal trajectory generation for autonomous driving under both continuous and logical constraints. Classical approaches based on continuous optimization formulate the trajectory generation problem as a nonlinear program, in which vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance requirements are enforced as nonlinear equality and inequality constraints. In general, gradient-based optimization methods are then used to find the optimal trajectory. However, these methods are ill-suited for logical constraints such as those raised by traffic rules, presence of obstacles and, more generally, to the existence of multiple maneuver variants. We propose a new formulation of the trajectory planning problem as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program. This formulation can be solved effectively using widely available solvers, and the resulting trajectory is guaranteed to be globally optimal. We apply our framework to several scenarios that are still widely considered as challenging for autonomous driving, such as obstacle avoidance with multiple maneuver choices, overtaking with oncoming traffic or optimal lane-change decision making. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its real-time applicability.",['info']
Public and private incentives for self-protection,"Governments sometimes encourage or impose individual self-protection measures, such as wearing a protective mask in public during an epidemic. However, by reducing the risk of being infected by others, more self-protection may lead each individual to go outside the house more often. In the absence of lockdown, this creates a “collective offsetting effect”, since more people outside means that the risk of infection is increased for all. However, wearing masks also creates a positive externality on others, by reducing the risk of infecting them. We show how to integrate these different effects in a simple model, and we discuss when self-protection efforts should be encouraged (or deterred) by a social planner.",['shs']
On Computing Minimal EL -Subsumption Modules,"In the paper we study algorithms for computing minimal modules that are minimal w.r.t. set inclusion and that preserve the entailment of all EL- subsumptions over a signature of interest. We follow the black-box approach for finding one or all justifications by replacing the entailment tests with logical dif- ference checks, obtaining modules that preserve not only a given consequence but all entailments over a signature. Such minimal modules can serve to improve our understanding of the internal structure of large and complex ontologies. Addition- ally, several optimisations to speed up the computation of minimal modules are investigated. We present an experimental evaluation of an implementation of our algorithms by applying them on the medical ontologies Snomed CT and NCI.",['info']
Our Trust in Pension Funds,"When Europeans decided to reform their retirement systems in the 1990s, they took the American model of retirement financing as their major point of reference. The defining feature of the American system is that financing is shared between a public federal regime, and a private complement in the form of a pension fund. Instituting this feature in continental Europe was the primary objective of reformers during the decade of stock market euphoria that marked the 1990s. Curiously, the effectiveness of this model has not been questioned following the market crash of 2001 or 2007, despite a series of social and economic blows suffered in the United States. What is more, the model continues to relentlessly insinuate itself into the institutional make up of continental European countries. How can we understand this persistent belief in the virtues of the pension funds?",['shs']
Representation formulas for limit values of long run stochastic optimal controls,"A classical problem in stochastic ergodic control consists of studying the limit behavior of the optimal value of a discounted integral in infinite horizon (the so called Abel mean of an integral cost) as the discount factor $\lambda$ tends to zero or the value defined with a Cesàro mean of an integral cost when the horizon $T$ tends to $+ \infty$. We investigate the possible limits in the norm of uniform convergence topology of values defined through Abel means or Ceàro means when $ \lambda \to 0^+ $ and $T \to + \infty $, respectively. Here we give two types of new representation formulas for the accumulation points of the values when the averaging parameter converges. We show that there is only one possible accumulation point which is the same for Abel means or Cesàro means. The first type of representation formula is based on probability measures on the product of the state space and the control state space, which are limits of occupational measures. The second type of representation formula is based on measures which are the projection of invariant measure on the space of relaxed controls. We also give a result comparing the both sets of measures involved in both classes of representation formulas. An important consequence of the representation formulas is the existence of the limit value when one has the equicontinuity property of Abel or Cesàro mean values. This is the case, for example, for nonexpansive stochastic control systems. In the end some insightful examples are given which help to better understand the results.",['shs']
Safety assessment of the substance poly((R)‐3‐hydroxybutyrate‐co‐(R)‐3‐hydroxyhexanoate) for use in food contact materials,"his opinion of the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of poly((R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate), Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) No 147398-31-0 and food contact material (FCM) substance No 1059, for contact with dry/solid food. This biodegradable (co)polymer is produced by fermentation of palm oil using a genetically modified microorganism (Cupriavidus necator). No migration of oligomers into food simulant E (10 days at 40 and 60 degrees C) was found at a detection limit per single oligomer of 5 mu g/kg food. Migration of the degradation product crotonic acid was 8 and 25 mu g/kg at the two test temperatures, respectively. The other migrating substances detected, likely originated from or are related to the authorised substance (FCM No. 9) 'palm oil and/or palm fatty acid distillate' used as carbon source for the fermentation. At the migration levels reported, these migrants do not give rise to safety concern. No genotoxicity data are required for poly((R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate) because of its high molecular weight. The fraction below 1,000 Da is 0.5%. The major monomeric unit in the copolymer, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, is an intermediate in fatty acid metabolism. The minor monomeric unit, 3-hydroxyhexanoic acid, tested negative for bacterial gene mutations. Degradation products, which may be present in the (co)polymer, are crotonic acid and (E)-2-hexenoic acid. Crotonic acid is authorised for use in FCM with a specific migration limit (SML) of 0.05 mg/kg food; for (E)-2-hexenoic acid, no indication for genotoxicity was identified by the EFSA CEF Panel in its 2010 group evaluation of flavouring substances in FGE.05Rev2. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance poly((R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate) is not of safety concern if used alone or in blends with other polymers for contact with dry/solid food. If the SML of crotonic acid is met, migration of (E)-2-hexenoic acid will also not exceed 0.05 mg/kg food.",['sdv']
Biomechanical Patient-Specific Model of the Respiratory System Based on 4D CT Scans and Controlled by Personalized Physiological,"In this paper, we present a dynamic patient-specific model of the respiratory system for a whole respiratory cycle, based on 4D CT scans, personalized physiological compliance (pressure-volume curves), as well as an automatic tuning algorithm to determine lung pressure and diaphragm force parameters. The amplitude of the lung pressure and diaphragm forces are specific, and differs from one patient to another and depends on geometrical and physiological characteristics of the patient. To determine these parameters at different respiratory states and for each patient, an inverse finite element (FE) analysis has been implemented to match the experimental data issued directly from 4D CT images, to the FE simulation results, by minimizing the lungs volume variations. We have evaluated the model accuracy on five selected patients, from DIR-Lab Dataset, with small and large breathing amplitudes, by comparing the FE simulation results on 75 landmarks, at end inspiration (EI), end expiration (EE) states, and at each intermediate respiratory state. We have also evaluated the tumor motion identified in 4D CT scan images and compared it with the trajectory obtained by FE simulation, during one complete breathing cycle. The results demonstrate the good quantitative results of our physic-based model and we believe that our model, despite of others takes into account the challenging problem of the respiratory variabilities.","['info', 'spi']"
Relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov predictions of superheavy magic nuclei,"The occurrence of spherical shell closures in the superheavy nuclei region is explored in the framework of the relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory (RHFB), and also with the simpler version of relativistic mean field with quasiparticles, in other words the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) approximation. Both theoretical frameworks are often used for nuclei in the known regions of the nuclear chart. Shell closures characterized in terms of two-nucleon gaps indicate the magic regions. The results depend slightly on the effective Lagrangians used, but the magic numbers beyond 208Pb are generally predicted to be Z = 120, 138 for protons and N = 172, 184, 228, 258 for neutrons. Shell effects are sensitive to various terms of the mean-field, such as the spin-orbit coupling, the scalar and effective masses.

"Low mass dilepton production in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions measured with ALICE at the LHC","The production of low-mass dileptons, including those from ρ, ω and ϕ light vector meson decays, provides key information on the hot and dense state of strongly interacting matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. In particular, strangeness production can be studied through ϕ meson measurements, while the detailed description of the full dilepton mass spectra down to the kinematic threshold can be used to reveal in-medium modifications of hadron properties and the thermal emission arising from the medium. Measurements in pp and p–A, respectively, provide a reference for the observations in heavy-ion collisions and give insight on soft particle production in cold nuclear matter. Dilepton production is studied with the ALICE apparatus at the LHC both at central (image) and forward (image) rapidity, respectively in the dielectron and dimuon channel. In this contribution, we present recent results on low-mass dimuon production at forward rapidity in Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions.",['phys']
Using steam thermolysis to recycle carbon fibres from composite waste,"In this article, Alpha Recyclage Composites presents a new steam thermolysis process to treat carbon fibre composites for recycling. The thermochemical process is used to recover the carbon fibres, which are then recycled into new thermoplastic composites.

On the Discontinuity of ε θ -the Dissipation Rate Associated with the Temperature Variance - at the Fluid-Solid Interface for Cases with Conjugate Heat Transfer,"Conjugate heat transfer describes the thermal coupling between a fluid and a solid. It is of prime importance in industrial applications where fluctuating thermal stresses are a concern, e.g. in case of a severe emergency cooling (Pressurized Thermal Shock) or long-term ageing of materials (T junctions). For such complex applications, investigations often rely on experiments, high Reynolds RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) or wall-modelled LES (Large Eddy Simulation). However , experimental data on conjugate heat transfer are scarce as walls in lab rigs are often made of plexiglas and the transported scalar studied is often a dye. The development of RANS models for conjugate heat transfer is relatively recent, see Craft et al. [1]. In this paper, we establish that the dissipation rate associated with the temperature variance is discontinuous at the fluid-solid interface, in case of conjugate heat transfer. This discontinuity is verified using some DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) of the turbulent channel flow with conjugate heat transfer. There is currently no RANS model for conjugate heat transfer that takes into account this discontinuity.",['phys']
Grabbing land in Malawi,"The distribution of land in Malawi is highly unequal and frequently inefficient. Large areas of land are underutilized in a context where many Malawian farmers would be able to put such land to productive use. In this context, the Malawian government has been slow and ineffective in undertaking land reforms, despite large demand for change both from investors and the local population. This chapter explores the role that grabbing of land in Malawi plays in contributing to this situation. We focus on various forms of malpractice, corruption or opportunistic behaviours associated with land transfers. We begin by briefly setting out the history and context of land in Malawi, and then discuss various types of land grabbing that occur currently. We highlight the problems that this form of corruption leads to, before moving to consider policy suggestions for both the government and donors. Finally, we conclude by attempting to draw out any lessons that this example may teach us about corruption more generally.7.1BACKGROUND AND CONTEXTThe grabbing of land is not a new phenomenon in Malawi. Much of the current context around land is a result of previous land transfers that took place under colonial rule. The expropriation of land by white settlers was not as large as in Zimbabwe or South Africa, but, by the time Malawi had acquired independence in 1964, Europeans had acquired ësome of the most fertile and well-watered landsí (PCILPR, 1998: 29).",['shs']

Dynamic stress prediction in catenary wires for fatigue analysis,"Fatigue cracks in the contact wire are a possible cause of fracture which can induce huge costs. Fatigue study is thus of a great interest but requires an accurate computations of stress distributions. OSCAR is a SNCF software used to study coupled pantograph / catenary dynamics. It is based on Euler-Bernoulli beam meshes. This formalism is accurate to study the catenary displacements, but is not sufficient to compute multi-axial stresses, in particular in parts that can concentrate stresses such as the junction claws. This paper details and illustrates the strategy developed to compute a full multi-axial transient stress field, in any point of the contact wire. The dynamic displacement computed by OSCAR is expanded and combined with a precise nonlinear static state of a mixed model of beams and volume elements.",['spi']
On the dynamical nature of Saturn's North Polar hexagon,"An explanation of long-lived Saturn's North Polar hexagonal circumpolar jet in terms of instability of the coupled system polar vortex - circumpolar jet is proposed in the framework of the rotating shallow water model, where scarcely known vertical structure of the Saturn's atmosphere is averaged out. The absence of a hexagonal structure at Saturn's South Pole is explained similarly. By using the latest state-of-the-art observed winds in Saturn's polar regions a detailed linear stability analysis of the circumpolar jet is performed (i) excluding (\jet-only"" configuration), and (2) including (""jet+vortex"" configuration) the north polar vortex in the system. A domain of parameters: latitude of the circumpolar jet and curvature of its azimuthal velocity profile, where the most unstable mode of the system has azimuthal wavenumber 6, is identified. Fully nonlinear simulations are then performed, initialized either with the most unstable mode of small amplitude, or with the random combination of unstable modes. It is shown that developing barotropic instability of the ""jet+vortex"" system produces a long-living structure akin to the observed hexagon, which is not the case of the ""jet-only"" system, which was studied in this context in a number of papers in literature. The north polar vortex, thus, plays a decisive dynamical role. The influence of moist convection, which was recently suggested to be at the origin of Saturn's north polar vortex system in the literature, is investigated in the framework of the model and does not alter the conclusions.",['phys']

The Empirical Turn of Literary Studies,"By the end of the 20th century, literary theory had acquired the mythified value of a universal explanatory framework, placing theories of the text in original ways at the roots of the tree of knowledges, and turning their academic analysts into the masters of such knowledge. With French Theory, textual and narrative theories, as well as rhetoric and semiology, were used to decoding the most disparate social facts, be it to understand a lover's discourse for Barthes, to deconstruct philosophy through literature for Jacques Derrida, to rethink historical narrative in Hayden White, or to analyze the poetics of science for Fernand Hallyn. Pursuing the linguistic turn that had affected philosophy, literary theory had led textual categories and logics to a universal and hegemonic ambition: everything was language, everything constituted discourse, everything represented a sign. In that respect, literary theory was more than a theory of literature, more than an epistemology or a « critique of critique ». It was, indeed, a « critique of ideology"" inseparable from an explicitly Foucauldian and secretly Marxist critical social thought, be it in its American culturalist version or in its more directly political French formulation. The critiques erected against this kind of literary theory have been clearly identified, and the cultural war against the cultural studies and their social constructivism centered around sexual and racial issues have resulted in a stagnation of theory, at least in the most prominent U.S. universities. The alliance of formalism and of left-wing ideologies in the service of an identitarian discourse, or the adoption of Derridian deconstruction as an anticapitalist weapon have been the object of fierce criticism, since the debate initiated the 1980s by Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels' ruthless article « Against theory » which triggered Richard Rorty's and Stanley Fish's counterattack , down to Daphne Patai and Will H.

"Science, Problem Solving and Bibliometrics","The head of a prestigious scientific institution recently said, by paraphrasing a famous quotation: ""we solve problems that are posed, not that we pose"". This view totally misses the history and role of human knowledge construction and prepares wrong ways for evaluating it.Science is not problem solving, it is theory building. Any relevant, difficult problem requires the construction of a new theoretical frame to deal with the problem in an original and effective way. Moreover, problems follow from the proposal of a theory. Animals continually solve problems that are posed to them by events. We, the humans, by language, in our communicating community, we looked at the Moon, at the Stars, which pose no problem, and invented Myths and Theories, and derived from them countless problems. We also looked at inert matter, a stone, some sand on a Greek beach, and proposed the atomistic theory. Science originated by these attempts to organize the world by concepts and theories. Later, it was radically renewed by looking again at planets, but from a different perspective: from the point of view of the Sun, on the grounds of a different metaphysics, which lead to a theoretical revolution. It was also renewed by looking at two falling stones in an original way and at physical trajectories as inertial, at the infinite limit of a non-existing frictionless movement...",['shs']

Broadcast Speedup in Vehicular Networks via Information Teleportation,"The goal of this paper is to increase our understanding of the fundamental communication properties in urban vehicle-to-vehicle mobile networks by exploiting the self-similarity and hierarchical organization of modern cities. We use an innovative model called ""hyperfractal"" that captures the self-similarities of both the traffic and vehicle locations, and yet avoids the extremes of regularity and randomness. We use analytical tools to derive matching theoretical upper and lower bounds for the information propagation speed in an urban delay tolerant network (i.e., a network that is disconnected at all time, and thus uses a store-carry-and-forward routing model). We prove that the average broadcast time behaves as n 1−δ (times a slowly varying function), where δ depends on the precise fractal dimension. Furthermore, we show that the broadcast speedup is due in part to an interesting self-similar phenomenon, that we denote as information teleportation. This phenomenon arises as a consequence of the topology of the vehicle traffic, and triggers an acceleration of the broadcast time. We show that our model fits real cities where open traffic data sets are available. The study presents simulations that confirm the validity of the bounds in multiple realistic settings, including scenarios with variable speed.",['info']
"The Paris Avant-Gardes. ""A prophet is not without honor save in his own country"" : A Cultural Transfert and Its Cases of Mistaken Identity","It is often asked how the various historical avant-gardes were able to persist in their avant-gardism when support from the art market was denied them out of hand. By avant-garde, we mean a position of rupture within the artistic field. How did they, even more astonishingly, succeed in gaining recognition? A comparative study of the confrontation between these avant-gardes and their publics on the international level offers, after many other studies, some answers to these questions. From the Realism of the 1850s to the virulent varieties of futurism [avenirisme] in the 1910s, artistic innovation was made possible by avant-garde painting’s physical as well as symbolic detour abroad. This detour allowed artists to remain avant-garde within the Parisian field while at the same time exporting a more saleable kind of painting. On the symbolic level, especially, the proverb that “A prophet is not without honor save in his own country” was able to provide a basis for the legitimacy of avant-garde claims about the internationalization of their careers, stirring European elites’ national guilty consciences.(1) This internationalization was rendered possible by the large range of cultural divisions among various countries: not only did one not know in one country what was being exhibited in another one, but also art was not looked upon in the same way from country to country, public expectations as well as the roles assigned to art not being the same. One could therefore work to adapt avant-garde exhibitions abroad. From the Realist period onward, the artists themselves, then increasingly their dealer friends, critics, and collectors, took charge of this vast movement of cultural transfer, but at the risk of making many compromises.",['shs']
Asymptotic of the maximal displacement in a branching random walk,"In this article, we study the maximal displacement in a branching random walk. We prove that its asymptotic behaviour consists in a first almost sure ballistic term, a negative logarithmic correction in probability and stochastically bounded fluctuations. This result, proved in [14] and [2] is given here under close-to-optimal integrability conditions. Borrowing ideas from [5] and [23], we provide simple proofs for this result, also deducing the genealogical structure of the individuals that are close to the maximal displacement.",['math']
Investigating Physical Visualizations,"Physical visualizations have been around for several decades and remained mostly unnoticed. They recently became popular in the form of data sculptures, due to a proliferation of data-driven artifacts produced by the art and design communities, and to a wider availability of rapid prototyping facilities such as fab labs. It has been recently suggested that such physical data representations are suitable for demonstrative, artistic or communicative purposes. But can physical visualizations also help carry out actual information visualization tasks?

"Safety assessment of the process ‘EREMA Recycling (MPR, Basic and Advanced technologies)’, used to recycle post‐consumer PET into food contact materials","This scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of the EREMA recycling process (the EREMA Multi-Purpose Reactor (MPR), EREMA Basic and EREMA Advanced technologies), with EU register number RECYC0134. The input to this process is hot washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, containing no more than 5% PET from non-food consumer applications. In the MPR technology, post-consumer washed and dried PET flakes are heated in a continuous reactor under vacuum. The EREMA MPR decontamination technology can be combined with an extrusion line for pellets or sheet (EREMA Basic) or with an additional reactor (EREMA Advanced). The decontamination efficiency of the main continuous reactor (EREMA MPR technology) was determined by the challenge test. The Panel noted that this reactor is the critical step that determines the decontamination efficiency of these three EREMA technologies. The operating parameters controlling its performance are well defined and are temperature, pressure and residence time. It was demonstrated that, depending on the operating conditions, the recycling process under evaluation is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0.1 mu g/kg food, derived from the exposure scenario for infants, and 0.15 mu g/kg food, derived from the exposure scenario for toddlers, when recycled PET is used at up to 100%.

"Safety assessment of the process ‘PEGRA‐V’, based on Starlinger IV+® technology, used to recycle post‐consumer PET into food contact materials","This scientific opinion of the EFSA Panelon Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety evaluation of the recycling process PEGRA-V (EU register number RECYC0137), which is based on the Starlinger IV+((R)) technology. The input of the process is hot caustic washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, containing no more than 5% of PET from non-food consumer applications. In this technology, washed PET flakes are dried and crystallised in a reactor, then extruded into pellets which are further crystallised in a second reactor. Crystallised pellets are then preheated in a third reactor and fed to the solid-state polycondensation (SSP) reactor. Having examined the challenge test provided, the Panelconcluded that the three steps, drying and crystallisation, extrusion and crystallisation and SSP are the critical steps that determine the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters that control their performance are well defined and they are the temperature, the gas flow and the residence time for the drying and crystallisation step, and the temperature, the pressure and the residence time for the extrusion and crystallisation step and the SSP step. Under these conditions, it was demonstrated that the recycling process is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0.1g/kg food. Therefore, the Panelconcluded that the recycled PET obtained from this process intended to be used up to 100% for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long-term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill, is not considered of safety concern. Trays made of this recycled PET are not intended to be used, and should not to be used in microwave and conventional ovens.",['sdv']

Valuing CO2 Emission Allowances with Stochastic Control,"The carbon market was launched in the European Union in 2005 as part of the EU's initiative to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This means that industrial players must now include their GHG emissions in their production costs. We aim to model the behaviour of an industrial agent who faces market uncertainties, and we compare the expected value of an optimal production strategy when buying (or not buying) supplementary emission allowances. This allows us to compute the agent's carbon indifference price which defines its market behaviour (buyer or not). We aim to use the resulting indifference price to study the sensitivity of the carbon market to the shape of the penalty and the emission allowances allocation.",['math']
"In-vitro fertilization in France: 200,000 “test-tube” babies in the last 30 years","In 2003, one French birth in twenty (5%) was achieved after a medical treatment or procedure. In half of these cases (2.4%) conception was obtained through ovarian stimulation, and the other half by either artificial insemination (0.8%) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) (1.7%). The proportion of births obtained after IVF alone has increased steadily over the last twenty years, rising from 0.52% of births in 1988 to 1.74% in 2006. This steady rise reflects both more frequent recourse to IVF and a better success rate (currently, 20-25% of attempts lead to the birth of at least one live child). In France, for 97% of children conceived by IVF, the social parents are also the genetic parents, i.e. no sperm or egg donations are involved. In 2006, only 304 children were born as a result of IVF with donor sperm, 106 with donor egg, and 10 with donor embryo.","['sdv', 'shs']"
Transition of agriculture to agroecology-based systems: lessons from the French experience,"For more than one decade now, and partly as a response to European Commission directives, the French government is promoting a transition of agriculture to agroecology. Agroecology is here considered as a mode of agricultural production that is able to reconcile economic, environmental and social performances at the farm level. The national governmental plan ECOPHYTO is targeting a drastic decrease in the reliance on pesticides. This plan is one component of the ‘Agroecological project for France’ launched in year 2012, which is pointing out a systemic vision of technological changes. Even though these governmental initiatives were not successful in transforming the agriculture of the country so far – maybe because they had to face severe reluctances from some (not all) major farmers organizations –, they launched several interesting projects, among which the DEPHY farm network. This network is composed of 3000 volunteer farmers, working in a peer-to-peer mode with the help of advisers to demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the reliance on pesticides while maintaining – or even enhancing – the economic vitality of the agricultural sector. The first major result from DEPHY was that differences in strategical options, based on various combinations of crop management techniques designed at the farming system level, explained most of the huge differences in the pesticide input level across framers, for similar production situations. The second – significant – result was that, in most production situations, those farms with agroecology-based cropping systems produced similar or even higher levels of agricultural outputs (incidentally more diversified), and similar or higher profits, as compared to standard farms based on high chemical inputs. Scale matters very much in those results, as what is true at the farm level might be quite different at the crop level. For example, wheat yields (expressed as tons per ha) were shown to be lower in low input management systems, because technical measures decreasing pest pressures (late sowing with resistant cultivars and moderate fertilization) tend to decrease also the yield potential. However, the decrease in wheat yield could be compensated for by the decrease in input costs, and could be considered a minor feature for farm profitability. Based on such results, the DEPHY network is promoting changes in the way of advising farmers, more focused on long term and systemic approaches, and targeting explicitly farm profitability rather than individual crop yield. Of course, agroecology-based farming systems increases the complexity of farm management. Pioneer farmers of the DEPHY network are not representative of farmers’ population. They are well educated and do invest a lot in knowledge acquisition and peer-to-peer training. They most often also show a high motivation for their job and for communicating about their personal experience. Upscaling the results of the DEPHY network at the country level provided information about the potential consequences of the widespread adoption of agroecology-based cropping systems in France. Pesticide use would decrease by about 40%. The overall agricultural production would increase, but wheat and barley production (and therefore exports) would decrease (partly because of lower yields, mostly because of a decrease in areas sown with wheat and barley). The local production of plant proteins for cattle feeding would increase, hence decreasing the need for foreign protein import. This, along with the decrease in fertilizer inputs, would offset the decrease in cereal export, and the overall agricultural trade balance would improve at the country level. These results are questioning the model of a trade balance mostly boosted by cereal exports. That is the main reason why the current organization of the agricultural sector (based on targets of minimizing diversity, maximizing yield to maximize exports) is a major hindrance for any large-scale adoption of agroecology-based farming systems. Nicolas Munier-Jolain is an agronomist of cropping/farming systems at INRA, research unit Agroecology, in Dijon, France. For more than two decades, he has been working on the issue of decreasing the reliance on pesticides in arable cropping systems in France, focusing mostly on weed management. His research on Integrated Weed Management is based on experimental activities (long term cropping system experiments), modelling weed communities as affected by cropping systems, and data mining using data sets produced by participative farm networks. Since 2011, he has worked with the farmers and advisers involved in reducing pestici",['sde']

Using Named Entities to Discover Heterogeneous Events on Twitter,"Social media sites such as Twitter 1 and Facebook 2 have emerged as powerful means of communication that allow people to exchange information about their daily activities, latest news or real-world events. Aside social interactions among users, social medias are expected to provide added value services in a variety of domains (e.g sentiment analysis, trend analysis and event detection). Detecting events on social medias poses new challenges due to the sparsity and the informal nature of social media posts. One of the main challenges in detecting events in social media is to differentiate event and non event messages. To face this challenge, we propose to take advantage from the knowledge that can be extracted from the Linked Opened Data (e.g. DBpedia) to enrich the short textual messages with contextual information brought by the presence of named entities. We evaluate our approach on two gold-standard datasets and the preliminary results show that exploiting the ontological categories of the named entities has a positive impact on the classification output.",['info']

"Safety assessment of the process ‘4PET’, based on EREMA Basic technology, used to recycle post‐consumer PET into food contact materials","his scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of the 4PET recycling process (EU register number RECYC0139), which is based on the EREMA Basic technology. The input to this process is hot washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) ( PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, containing no more than 5% PET from non-food consumer applications. In this technology, post-consumer washed and dried PET flakes are heated in a continuous reactor under vacuum before being extruded. Having examined the results of the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the continuous reactor step (step 2) is the critical step that determines the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters controlling its performance are well defined and are temperature, pressure and residence time. It was demonstrated that, depending on the operating conditions, the recycling process under evaluation is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0.15 lg/kg food, derived from the exposure scenario for toddlers. The Panel concluded that recycled PET obtained from the process is not of safety concern when the final thermoformed trays and containers and PET beverage bottles manufactured with the recycled pellets and not used for packaging water or ready-to-feed liquid infant formulae contain up to 90% recycled post-consumer PET.

Community-based forest management certification in Brazil: a sustainable initiativeCertification de l’exploitation communautaire du bois au Brésil : des initiatives durables en Amazonie ?,"The Brazilian Amazon is one of the largest world tropical forests. It provides more than 80 % of the national timber production and makes Brazil the second largest producer of tropical wood. The forestry sector is of major importance in several areas in term of economic product and employment creation. However, the Brazilian Amazon is also famous for its high deforestation rate - on average between 2 and 2,5 million hectares annually - and for its rather unsustainable timber resource management, putting on the balance the long-term future of the forestry sector in the region. In this context, since the middle 1990s and strongly supported by WWF (World Wildlife Fund), there has been a significant growth of forest sustainable management certification projects by the FSC - Forest Stewardship Council, mainly from large scale companies. Community based forest management certification projects have also increased, but few of them have acquired the FSC label. In 2006, eight Community-based forest management plans are certified by the FSC. Most of them have been implemented with the support of environmental NGOs and public funds. If the advantages of certification for the communities are strongly defended by such organizations, reality is less optimistic. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of the participation of some families to certified community- based forest management plans and the long term sustainability of such projects. The results are based on surveys made in the State of Acre (two certified community – based management plans).L’Amazonie Brésilienne est un des derniers grands massifs forestiers de la planète. Elle assure encore 80 % de la production nationale de bois et fait du Brésil le second plus grand producteur de bois tropical.

Cependant, l’Amazonie Brésilienne est aussi connue pour avoir un taux de déforestation élevé – en moyenne entre 2 et 2,5 millions d’hectares annuellement – et une exploitation peu durable de ses ressources ligneuses, remettant en cause la pérennité à long terme du secteur forestier dans la région. Dans ce contexte, depuis le milieu des années 1990, on observe une croissance des projets de certification de l’exploitation durable des forêts, principalement des grandes entreprises privées, sous l’impulsion du WWF (World Wildlife Fund) qui a introduit au Brésil la certification par le FSC – Forest Stewardship Council.

Les projets de certification communautaire sont généralement mis en place par des organisations environnementales ou d’appui aux agriculteurs. L’espérance de gain est un des moteurs de ces projets. Au sein des communautés traditionnelles extractivistes, la gestion communautaire est également vue comme un moyen supplémentaire pour freiner la déforestation par les colons venant d’autres régions. Malgré les avantages de la certification souvent mis en avant par les organisations environnementales pour les communautés, la réalité est moins optimiste. Dans cet article, on se propose d’analyser les motifs sous-jacents à la participation à long terme des familles amazoniennes à une gestion communautaire certifiée de leur réserve forestière et la durabilité à long terme des projets certifiés existants. Les résultats sont basés sur des enquêtes de terrain dans l’Etat de l’Acre auprès de producteurs participant à deux des projets de gestion communautaire actuellement certifiés par le FSC et sur une analyse institutionnelle de ces deux projets.",['shs']

Constructive Heuristics for Periodic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem,"This paper introduces a new variant of the electric vehicle routing problem, named PEVRP for Periodic Electric Vehicles Routing Problem, in which the routing and charging are planned over a multi-period horizon, subject to frequency constraints, limited fleet of electric vehicles available at the depot, intermediate facilities for charging during the trips, and partial charging. The objective of the PEVRP is to minimize the total cost of routing and charging over the time horizon, such that each vehicle could be charged nightly at the deport, and during the day at charging stations if refuelling is necessary. We propose two constructive heuristics. The first one is based on clustering technique that aims at allocating customers per vehicle and per period, and then constructs tour for each vehicle visiting customers and charging stations for refuelling. The second one is based on best insertion strategy, in which each customer is allocated to its best position that minimizes charging a nd routing cost. Using several parameters setting, we compared and analysed the results of the two proposed approaches on 50 new instances derived from EVRP instances of the literature.",['info']

Deep Learning Techniques for Music Generation -- A Survey,"This paper is a survey and an analysis of different ways of using deep learning (deep artificial neural networks) to generate musical content. We propose a methodology based on five dimensions for our analysis: • Objective – What musical content is to be generated? Examples are: melody, polyphony, accompaniment or counterpoint. – For what destination and for what use? To be performed by a human(s) (in the case of a musical score), or by a machine (in the case of an audio file). • Representation – What are the concepts to be manipulated? Examples are: waveform, spectrogram, note, chord, meter and beat. – What format is to be used? Examples are: MIDI, piano roll or text. – How will the representation be encoded? Examples are: scalar, one-hot or many-hot. • Architecture – What type(s) of deep neural network is (are) to be used? Examples are: feedforward network, recurrent network, autoencoder or generative adversarial networks. • Challenges – What are the limitations and open challenges? Examples are: variability, interactivity and creativity. • Strategy – How do we model and control the process of generation? Examples are: single-step feedforward, iterative feedforward, sampling or input manipulation. For each dimension, we conduct a comparative analysis of various models and techniques and we propose some tentative multidimensional typology. This typology is bottom-up, based on the analysis of many existing deep-learning based systems for music generation selected from the relevant literature. These systems are described in this survey and are used to exemplify the various choices of objective, representation, architecture, challenges and strategies. The last part of the paper includes some discussion and some prospects.

Individualized Visits to Foster the Engagement and the re-visit in Museums,"Museums have become places that, besides conserving and storing artefacts, provide visitors with education and amusement. They now have to compete with the entertainment industry to attract visitors and expand their audience. The use of digital technology is emerging as a solution. While many studies focus on the visitor side, we are interested in tools for museum staff. To understand their needs and processes, we adopted a participatory and iterative design process, involving museum professionals as end-users at each step (i.e. user observation, design, prototyping, users tests). We conducted 7 meetings, 4 interviews studies and 2 experimental observations with 12 museum experts (communication, IT, public and content experts) from 5 institutions (Exhibition Centres, Science Centre, Archaeological Museum, Museum of Fine Arts). Our analysis revealed two issues faced by these museums. First, despite the recommendation of institutional documents, visitors service is almost never involved before the end of the exhibition design process. Thus, they have no mean to shape the scenography in order to adapt it to visitors. Second, we identified a strong need for encouraging local visitors’ engagement and revisit. Diversifying the visits is a solution considered by museums, but relying on temporary exhibits is too costly for small museums and creating thematic visits is not participatory enough. The creation of individualized visits, allowing visitors to explore existing exhibition on their own depending on their needs and desires, meets both challenges. We thus focus on the design of tools that empower museum professionals to create such visits. We identified that museums need, first, to collect more information about their visitors and, second, to be able to create, evolve and maintain the solutions on their own according to visitors needs. Our aim is to design a tool which respects these two key points and could enable the creation of personalized and dynamic museum visits.",['info']
Re-designing knowledge management systems : Towards user-centred design methods integrating information architecture,"The work presented in this paper focuses on the improvement of corporate knowledge management systems. For the implementation of such systems, companies deploy can important means for small gains. Indeed, management services often notice very limited use compared to what they actually expect. We present a five-step redesigning approach which takes into account different factors to increase the use of these systems. We use as an example the knowledge sharing platform implemented for the employees of Société du Canal de Provence (SCP). This system was taken into production but very occasionally used. We describe the reasons for this limited use and we propose a design methodology adapted to the context. Promoting the effective use of the system, our approach has been experimented and evaluated with a panel of users working at SCP.",['info']
Selection of a method for SIA using AHP,"Increasing of environmental conflicts during the planning or execution of projects makes social impact assessment necessary and objective, in order to prevent potential environmental conflicts. In this paper, we present a study to select the best alternative methodology available and applicable for social impact assessment (SIA) on projects and programs. The selection was conducted using the methodology of analytic hierarchy process (AHP). In this study, four alternative methods for social impact assessment were proposed: Delphi, AHP, FAHP and grey clustering, which were ranked according to criteria: quantification, robustness and standardization. To make the selection using AHP, a panel of four experts was convoked for this study. The results showed that the best method for social impact assessment is the grey clustering complemented with Delphi method and other qualitative procedures during field work and data collection.",['sde']
The Influence of Smartphone Over-dependence on the Recall of Basic Mathematics among Mathematics Education Students in a Nigerian University,"Recent decades have seen dramatic increase in the amount of technology available to and used by children, a fact that has clearly shaped the way children learn mathematics. An unintended outcome of technology integration in mathematics education is the growing dependence among students on the internet as a source of information previously committed to memory. This study employs a simple survey to determine how the ubiquity of smart phones among mathematics education students influence their ability to recall basic mathematics concepts. Structured Basic Mathematics Recall Task (BMRT) and Smartphones Influence on Mathematics Recall Questionnaire (SIMRQ) were developed for the study and administered to a random sample of 180 mathematics education students. Simple percentages and means were used to analyze the data obtained from the BMRT and SIMRQ. The outcomes of the study indicate that 46.7% of mathematics education students could correctly recall formulas and values of basic mathematical constants, 31.6% could correctly provide the statement and definition of basic math concepts, and 28.3% could correctly tell when to use a particular formula under specific conditions. The results of the study reveal that processes of human memory are adapting to the advent of digital technology, with students displaying low recall of foundational facts and high impatience to quickly rush to the internet in quest of information previously memorized. The findings of this study points to the fact that true mathematical prowess in the current age is only achievable through the conscious effort of the learner in internalizing basic mathematical concepts and regular practice of learnt facts. Based on the findings, it was recommended that students should be guided through measured technology integration in mathematics instructional delivery to avoid over-dependence on technological tools.","['scco', 'info', 'shs']"
Gestion et traitement de l'eau à Singapour : que retenir ?,"L'eau est une ressource stratégique pour Singapour qui s'est doté d'une organisation monopolistique mais efficace en matière d'approvisionnement, de gestion, de traitement : le PUB (Public Utility Board).

"Competing land uses and fossil fuel, and optimal energy conversion rates during the transition toward a green economy under a pollution stock constraint.","We study the transition to a carbon-free economy in a model with a polluting non-renewable resource and a clean renewable resource. Transforming primary energy into ready-to-use energy services is costly and more efficient energy transformation rates are more costly to achieve. Renewable energy competes with food production for land and the food productivity of land can be improved at some cost. To avoid catastrophic climate damages, the pollution stock is mandated to stay below a given cap. When the economy is not constrained by the cap, the efficiency of energy transformation increases steadily until the transition toward the ultimate green economy; when renewable energy is exploited, its land use rises at the expense of food production; food productivity increases together with the land rent but food production drops; the food and energy prices increase and renewables substitute for non-renewable energy. During the constrained phase, the economy follows a constant path of prices, quantities, efficiency rates, food productivity and land rent, a phenomenon we call the ‘ceiling efficiency paradox’.",['shs']
On Sharing Responsibilities for Pollution Embodied in Trade,"In this article, we propose a new way of assessing environmental responsibility at the country level, taking into account their trade balance in terms of carbon. Starting from the fact that the approach based on the respective responsibilities of the producer and the consumer, which are widely promoted and used in the literature, each have their own limitations, we introduce a modified formula for the net trade balance of carbon at the country level. To do this, we examine the extent to which trade flows for a given country increase or decrease global emissions relative to the virtual situation where imports would have been produced in the consumer country. We argue that it would be fair for countries to retain responsibility for the additional emissions they create when trading. We then discuss the incentives provided by the modified liability rule to reduce emission intensity and extend our formula to include trade in intermediate goods. Finally, we illustrate our concept using World Bank and OECD data on trade flows and emission intensity ratios. We characterize six groups of countries according to the respective order of their producer, consumer and our new liability rule.Dans cet article, nous proposons une nouvelle façon d’évaluer la responsabilité environnementale au niveau des pays en tenant compte de leur balance commerciale en terme de carbone. Partant du fait que l’approche fondée sur les responsabilités respectives du producteur et du consommateur, largement encouragées et utilisées dans la littérature, ont chacune leurs propres limites, nous introduisons une formule modifiée pour la balance commerciale nette du carbone au niveau du pays. Pour ce faire, nous examinons dans quelle mesure les flux commerciaux pour un pays donné augmentent ou diminuent les émissions mondiales par rapport à la situation virtuelle où les importations auraient été produites dans le pays de consommation. Nous soutenons qu’il serait juste que les pays conservent la responsabilité des émissions supplémentaires qu’ils créent lorsqu’ils font du commerce. Nous discutons ensuite des incitations apportées par la règle de responsabilité modifiée pour diminuer l’intensité en émissions et étendons notre formule pour inclure le commerce des biens intermédiaires. Enfin, nous illustrons notre concept à l’aide de données de la Banque mondiale et de l’OCDE sur les flux commerciaux et les ratios d’intensité en émissions. Nous caractérisons six groupes de pays en fonction de l’ordre respectif de leur responsabilité producteur, consommateur et de notre nouvelle règle de responsabilité.",['shs']
Enlightening force chains: a review of photoelasticimetry in granular matter,"A photoelastic material will reveal its internal stresses when observed through polarizing filters. This eye-catching property has enlightened our understanding of granular materials for over half a century, whether in the service of art, education, or scientific research. In this review article in honor of Robert Behringer, we highlight both his pioneering use of the method in physics research, and its reach into the public sphere through museum exhibits and outreach programs. We aim to provide clear protocols for artists, exhibit-designers, educators, and scientists to use in their own endeavors. It is our hope that this will build awareness about the ubiquitous presence of granular matter in our lives, enlighten its puzzling behavior, and promote conversations about its importance in environmental and industrial contexts. To aid in this endeavor, this paper also serves as a front door to a detailed wiki containing open, community-curated guidance on putting these methods into practice (Abed-Zadeh et al. in Photoelastic methods wiki https ://git-xen.lmgc.univ-montp 2.fr/Photo Elast icity /Main/wikis /home, 2019).","['spi', 'phys']"
Environmental Benefits of Farm- and District-Scale Crop-Livestock Integration,"Specialized farms and districts generally perform poorly when assessed in terms of environmental impact or ecosystem services provision. Well-managed synergies between crop and livestock production occurring either at the farm scale or at the district scale have the potential to limit environmental problems via, for example, nutrient cycle closure and diversified crop rotations and land uses. However, there is a lack of research using empirical farm data to quantify the actual benefits or drawbacks of crop-livestock integration strategies. Therefore, a farming system approach was used in the “Crops and Animal Together” project (FP7 Project CANTOGETHER) to assess diverse strategies of crop-livestock integration at both farm (10 farms in FR, NL, IT, IE, UK) and district levels (5 districts in ES, IE, FR, NL, CH). The district-level strategies assessed were (1) local exchange of materials among farms (grain, slurry); (2) provision of high-quality forages (cooperative dehydration facility); (3) land exchange between dairy and arable farms; and (4) animal exchanges between lowland and highland regions (heifer rearing). A selection of noncooperating baseline farms (specialized and, where available, mixed) were compared with specialized cooperating farms in each district","['sdv', 'phys']"
"Bacterial Rhizosphere Biodiversity from Several Pioneer Desert Sand Plants Near Jizan, Saudi Arabia","Life in arid regions and, in particular, hot deserts is often limited due to their harsh environmental conditions, such as large temperature fluctuations and low amounts of water. These extreme environments can influence the microbial community present on the surface sands and any rhizosphere members surrounding desert plant roots. The Jizan desert area, located in Saudi Arabia, supports particular vegetation that grows in the large sandy flat terrain. We examined five different samples, four from the rhizosphere of pioneer plants plus a surface sand sample, and used pyrosequencing of PCR-amplified V1-V3 regions of 16S rDNA genes from total extracted DNA to reveal and compare the bacterial population diversity of the samples. The results showed a total of 3,530 OTUs in the five samples, calculated using ≥ 97% sequence similarity levels. The Chao1 estimation of the bacterial diversity fluctuated from 637 to 2,026 OTUs for a given sample. The most abundant members found in the samples belong to the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla. This work shows that the Jizan desert area of Saudi Arabia can contain a diverse bacterial community on the sand and surrounding the roots of pioneer desert plants. It also shows that desert sand microbiomes can vary depending on conditions, with broad implications for sandstone monument bacterial communities",['sde']

Security of mineral resources: A new framework for quantitative assessment of criticality,"This article discusses the limits of economic growth through the issue of criticality of mineral raw materials. It proposes to use and expand the existing work -but not in France or for France- and then apply them to the French economy between 2009 and 2014 via the example of lithium to provide available indicators and the methodology for identifying pressure signals in the supply of raw materials not so far undetectable in existing criticality studies. After building a database on 15 years of production and world trade of lithium, a literature contextualizing the issue of criticality and articulating the criticality factors with the functioning of commodity markets is performed. The reference model of the European Commission is then explained. In addition to these introductory contributions, the main are threefold: the reconfiguration of existing indicators criticality to the French case; the proposal of a new complementary criticality indicator to the Commission’s two and which takes into account not only the upstream market of the material but also its downstream processing by the economy; Finally the definition of high and low criticality allows to generate twelve indicators and variants (four strong (s) and eight low) from the two previous points and subjected to robustness checks.Cet article traite des limites de la croissance économique à travers la question de criticité des matières premières minérales. Il se propose d’utiliser et d’élargir les travaux existants -mais pas en France, ni pour elle- puis de les appliquer à l’économie française de 2009 à 2014 via l’exemple du lithium afin de mettre à sa disposition des indicateurs permettant de d’identifier des signaux de tensions dans la fourniture de matières premières de nature encore indétectables dans les études de criticité existantes.

"INFLUENCE OF IONIC CONTENTS ON THE STRATIFICATION OF ASTOMATIA AND HYSTEROCINETIDAE (CILIOPHORA, OLIGOHYMENOPHORA) ALONG THE DIGESTIVE TRACT OF ALMA EMINI (OLIGOCHAETE, GLOSSOSCOLECIDAE) FROM THE CENTER REGION OF CAMEROON","The intestinal liquid of A. emini was extracted using the vacuum aspiration technique, followed by measurement of ion concentrations and concomitantly recorded species abundance. Nitrate (NO3-) concentration decreased from the foregut to the hindgut. Nitrites (NO2-), ammoniums (NH4+) and orthophosphates (PO43-) reached their greatest levels in the midgut. Furthermore, correlation analyses between ion contents and ciliate abundance in different compartments were performed. In the foregut, a positive and significant correlation was found between the abundance of the Paracoelophrya ebebdensis and PO43-. In the midgut, a positive and significant correlation was observed between the number of the ciliates Dicoelophrya mediovacuolata; Coelophrya roquei; Coelophrya ovales; Ptychostomum commune and NO2-; Almophrya mediovacuolata and NH4+.

The clove tree of Madagascar: a success story with an unpredictable future,"The clove tree was introduced to Madagascar from the Maluku Islands in Indonesia at the beginning of the 19th century. In spite of its sensitivity to hazards such as cyclones, a locally found pest known as andretra and year-on-year variability in the production of cloves, it has adapted surprisingly well to the ecological conditions on Madagascar’s East coast, particularly the Analanjirofo Region. The species was adopted very rapidly by farmers (some settlers but mostly native peasant farmers), who integrated it into their cropping systems as a complement to their staple crops (rice, in particular) and cash crops (coffee and vanilla). Currently, the marketability of cloves brings a regular income to households, ensuring them food security. The clove tree bears two products of high economic value, the clove, which is the dried flower bud, and the essential oil, derived from distillation of the leaves, of which Madagascar is the world’s number one exporter. Products from the clove tree, along with vanilla, accunt for the largest (second largest in some years) proportion of Madagascar’s agricultural exports. Cloves are exported primarily to Indonesia to be used in the production of the local cigarettes known as kretek. There is a small demand from northern countries for exports of the clove spice. Clove essential oil is produced in a plethora of redimentary stills located throughout the clove growing zone. The quality of the essential oil depends on the content of eugenol, a molecule of interest in a number of commercial sectors including the cosmetic industry, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and the food industry. The clove tree in Madagascar seems to represent an example of successful adoption and integration of a new crop into existing production systems. However, the clove tree plantations are ageing and the conditions for their renewal are not fully established. Whilst the market for cloves is largely dependent on demand from Indonesia, the future looks promising for the world market in clove spices and eugenol-based products. Consequently, current practices and possible ways of adapting and developing the Malagasy clove sector in new directions need to be investigated and addressed in order to balance the future demands of the markets with the needs of the farmers in terms of resource management and valorization.El clavero, introducido en Madagascar a principios del s. XIX, es originario de las islas Molucas en Indonesia. A pesar de su sensibilidad a riesgos meteorológicos como los ciclones, a los ataques de un parásito local, andretra , y a la variable producción de clavos de olor de un año para otro, su adaptación a las condiciones eco- lógicas de la costa este de Madagascar, especialmente en la región de Analanjirofo, es sorprendente. La especie fue adoptada muy rápidamente por los campesinos (autóctonos en su mayoría y algunos foráneos) que la integraron en sus sistemas de cultivo como complemento de los cultivos alimentarios (sobre todo arroz) y comerciales (café y vainilla). Actualmente el mercado del clavo de olor supone una fuente regular de ingresos para los hogares y les garantiza la seguridad alimentaria. El clavero proporciona dos productos de gran valor eco- nómico: el clavo de olor —los botones florales secos— y el aceite esencial de clavo, producido mediante destilación de las hojas y del que Madagascar es el primer exportador mundial.Junto con la vainilla, los productos del clavero representan los primeros productos agrícolas de exportación (algunos años los segundos) de Madagascar. Los clavos de olor se exportan sobre todo a Indonesia, en donde se usan para elaborar unos cigarrillos locales denominados kretek . Una pequeña parte se exporta hacia los países del norte como especia. El aceite esencial del clavero es destilado en una multitud de rudimentarios alambiques en toda el área de cultivo. La calidad del aceite depende de su contenido de eugenol, compuesto empleado en muchos sectores económicos como la industria cosmética, la farmacéutica humana y veterinaria y la industria alimentaria. El clavero de Madagascar parece representar un ejemplo de integración exitosa de un nuevo cultivo en un sistema agrícola ya existente. Sin embargo, las plantaciones de claveros envejecen y no se reúnen plenamente las condiciones para su renovación. Mientras que el mercado del clavo de olor depende en gran medida de la demanda indonesia, las perspectivas son prometedoras en el mercado mundial de especias y en productos a base de eugenol. Por ello, hay que estudiar detenidamente las prácticas actuales y las posibilidades de adaptación y desarrollo del sector malgache del clavo para garantizar el equilibrio futuro entre mercados y necesidades campesinas en cuanto al manejo del recurso y a su valorización.Introduit à Madagascar au début du 19e siècle, le giroflier est originaire des îles Moluques en Indonésie. Malgré la sensibilité de l’essence aux risques météorologiques, tels les cyclones, et aux attaques d’un parasite local, andretra, et malgré la production variable de clous de girofle d’une année sur l’autre, son adaptation aux conditions écologiques de la côte Est de Madagascar, notamment dans la région d’Analanjirofo, est remarquable. Très vite adoptée par les paysans (certains venus s’installer mais la plupart autochtones), ceux-ci l’ont intégrée dans leurs systèmes de culture en complément aux cultures vivrières (riz, surtout) et de rapport (café et vanille). Aujourd’hui, le marché du clou de girofle est une source de revenus réguliers pour les ménages et leur assure la sécurité alimentaire. Le giroflier donne deux produits de grande valeur économique, le clou de girofle, le bouton floral séché, et l’huile essentielle de girofle produite par distillation des feuilles, dont Madagascar est le premier exportateur mondial. Avec la vanille, les produits du giroflier représentent les premiers produits agricoles d’exportation, parfois les deuxièmes, de Madagascar. Les clous de girofle s’exportent surtout en Indonésie, où ils entrent dans la fabrication d’une cigarette locale appelée kretek. Un petit volume s’exporte vers les pays du nord sous forme d’épice. L’huile essentielle de girofle est distillée dans une multitude d'alambics rudimentaires dans toute la région de production. La qualité de l’huile essentielle dépend de sa teneur en eugénol, molécule mise en oeuvre dans de nombreux secteurs économiques, dont l’industrie des cosmétiques, la pharmaceutique humaine et vétérinaire et l’industrie alimentaire. Le giroflier de Madagascar semble représenter un exemple d’intégration réussie d’une nouvelle culture dans un système de cultures existant. Cependant, les plantations de girofliers vieillissent et les conditions de leur renouvellement ne sont pas pleinement présentes. Alors que le marché du clou de girofle dépend fortement de la demande indonésienne, les perspectives sont prometteuses sur le marché mondial des épices et des produits contenant de l’eugénol. De ce fait, les pratiques actuelles et les possibilités d’adaptation et de développement du secteur Malgache de la girofle doivent être étudiées de près pour assurer l’équilibre futur entre les marchés et les besoins des paysans en termes de gestion de la ressource et de sa valorisation.",['sdv']
Landscape features to improve pest control in Agriculture,"Despite wide acceptance of the importance of integrated pest management, pest control in most cropping systems depends on the extensive use of pesticides, with detrimental effects on environmental and human health. These effects have led to many pesticides being removed from use, increasing demands for the rapid development of alternative solutions. Biological pest control aims for control through natural enemies, which significantly reduces and even eliminates pesticide use in crops. The role of noncultivated areas in agricultural landscapes in supporting biodiversity functions, such as the biological control by providing natural enemies with food and refuge, is only partially understood. Efficient implementation of biological pest control requires a wide range of knowledge and skills, not least those of farmers. Here we suggest the promotion of so called operational groups composed of farmers, scientists (agronomists and ecologists), extension service advisors, agribusiness representatives, and consumer associations to create objectives, strategies, and procedures to be realized at the local, regional, or national level. In this context, it is proposed that farmers will play a crucial role in providing solutions, as well as implementing, and disseminating practical knowledge and the concrete implementation of solutions.",['sdv']

Scalable Wireless Traffic Capture Through Community Detection and Trace Similarity,"Best-performing WLAN monitoring systems must capture as much wireless traffic as possible. To achieve this aim, several monitors are employed to capture wireless exchanges in a target area. Monitors potentially generate large traces that are all merged together to have a more complete, global view of the network behavior. Traces are often more equal than complementary, leading to the underutilization of monitors and to a higher system complexity. In this paper, we propose a methodology to make an efficient use of monitors in order to increase scalability. Such a methodology, based on trace similarity and community detection in graphs, ranks traces to reveal how many and which ones must be merged. Traces at the bottom of the rank, which belong to under-used monitors, are candidates to be relocated somewhere else to extend the target area. We evaluate the proposed methodology in two real-case scenarios. Results show that we can remove up to half of the monitors in our scenarios and still keep the same level of coverage.",['info']

Science and Technology in the First World War,"The subject “Science and Technology in the First World War” has so far been treated from the perspective on inventions and the development of new weapons, and often the focus has been on the topic of chemical warfare at the expense of other important dimensions. The approach of this Archival Research Guide, by contrast, comes from the social sciences and focuses on the establishment of relevant scientific, military and governmental bodies and on the personal networks established during the war. By examining these institutions and networks country by country, comparisons between them can be drawn, enabling further research with regard to the sociology of institutions. By pointing to the connections and channels of exchange between the nations and institutions under consideration, this approach opens up a transnational perspective and supports the paradoxal insight that transnational ties can dissolve national obstacles while simultaneously strengthening the nation-states themselves. On the individual level, the ARG takes the role of intellectuals into account, for whom scientific objectivity / neutrality and patriotic commitment seemed to have been no contradiction. It is remarkable that the First World War led to the establishment of several institutions aiming at funding science through the state, most notably in the case of France (CNRS), the U.S. (NACA/NASA) and Russia (KEPS).",['shs']
NORWEGIAN OIL MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE: FAROUK AL-KASIM INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS,"After the discovery of oil in the Norwegian coast, many uncertainties were raised in the public administration and environmentalists but Farouk Al-Kasim came up with innovative ideas on how to handle the present and future of the oil industry. Farouk Al-Kasim is considered as one of the fathers of the Norwegian oil model; a rare example of good governance among the major oil-producing countries. The Norwegian model has to take accountability on first, the expertise of Farouk Al-Kasim, second, the state's institutional capacity and third, the political stability and government transparency. This article focuses on how Norway managerial structure could affect the state's economy, and refers to the oil market of Norway. It also shows how Norway success depends on its initial institutions and a package of innovative and sustainable strategies. The paper concludes that good governance has been affecting the economic and political equilibrium of Norway economy. This article describes how the policy and management decisions taken in the past have a great impact on the present and are expected to positively affect the future equilibrium of Norway.","['sde', 'shs']"
Impact of mastication on the gastric digestion of frankfurters : case of elderly,"This work was designed to evaluate the impact of deficient food oral processing and aging digestive conditions on a model food: frankfurters. Food boluses were prepared for normal mastication or deficient chewing by programing a mastication simulator (AM2). Gastric digestion was simulated using a dynamic in vitro digester (DIDGI®) of adult and elderly physiological conditions. Lipids, proteins and peptides kinetic release were assessed by Infrared spectroscopy. We observed a low impact of chewing on normal gastric digestion, mainly compensated by the activity of gastric enzymes and the acidic conditions. However, in elderly digestive conditions, a delay in release of macronutrients with a less extent occur. This study can be considered as a proof of concept with a purpose for developing specific food for elderly, adapted to their ability for oral processing and digestive physiology.",['sdv']
5G innovations for new business opportunities,"5G is the next generation mobile network that enables innovation and supports progressive change across all vertical industries and across our society . Through its Radio Access Network (RAN) design and its orchestrated end-to-end architecture, it has the potential to boost innovation and generate economic growth in the European economy. The 5G service models support agility and dynamicity, thereby impacting the granularity, duration and trustworthiness of business relationships. The ability to combine private and public networks and data centres across multiple domains in a secure and controlled way facilitates collaborative business processes. It reshapes the digital business ecosystem with new value chains linking stakeholders from the telecommunications world and the vertical industries in win-win situations. New stakeholders emerge in this evolved ecosystem, for example cloud companies and software houses that profit from the cloudification and virtualization of the infrastructure, and brokers that facilitate sharing of spectrum and trading of connectivity and processing resources. Small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups are able to embed 5G in their innovative products and services for existing and new customers and markets, leveraging on the Anything as a Service (XaaS) model. These opportunities are conditioned by the ability of 5G architecture and technologies to deliver the performance levels required for vertical industry stakeholders to engage in the 5G digital business ecosystem. This white paper highlights the technological innovations of the first phase of the 5G Public Private Partnership (5G PPP) and how they contribute to the key performance targets for the 5G service classes: enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC). The performance levels ensure an unprecedented experience for end users including high data rates, reduced end-to-end latency, massive connectivity, ultra-reliability and support for very high mobility. The 5G PPP innovations go far beyond what is announced for early 5G deployments. For eMBB service, the integration of mm-wave and frequencies below 6 GHz, along with ultra-dense networks and nomadic nodes, ensure the targeted performance levels with ubiquitous coverage and in high mobility scenarios, in contrast with standalone deployments of mm-wave networks, suitable for fixed usage. The innovations related to the transport network allow also translating the peak throughputs available at the air interface into perceived user experience at affordable deployment cost for operators. In addition to this, the envisioned 5G air interface serves simultaneously all service classes (eMBB, mMTC and URLLC) in a cost effective way, paving the way for new business opportunities with and for verticals. The 5G concept developed in this paper is not limited to the RAN; it covers the end-to-end path and allows the 5G network to act as a secure, reliable and flexible orchestration platform across multiple domains. The 5G PPP innovations converge towards the vision of 5G as a holistic orchestration platform that integrates networking, computing and storage resources into one programmable and unified infrastructure. The 5G PPP innovations on multi-domain orchestration enable quick end-to-end service deployment and dynamic sharing of networking and processing resources among stakeholders. The 5G security architecture is built on a baseline trust model as a fundamental feature, and provides tools to analyse trust and make it explicit in specific scenarios. The 5G architecture ensures resilience of the network against attacks and its availability during failure incidents. Availability and reliability are achieved by mechanisms such as error recovery, fault detection and fault resolution. These security, reliability and flexibility properties, along with the multi-service air interface, ensure that the 5G network is not just an enhanced air interface as for pre-5G early deployments, announced for the period 2018-2020, but also an open platform for new business opportunities. The architecture and protocols are designed to adapt to a wide range of deployment scenarios including deep indoor, hot spots, urban areas, rural areas, maritime areas and in an aeronautical context. The 5G concept combines various access technologies, such as cellular, wireless, satellite and wireline, for delivering reliable performance for critical communications and improve area coverage. Standardization and spectrum regulation are critical elements for avoiding fragmentation of future deployments and increasing efficiency by eliminating redundant options. Spectrum regulation must ensure the early availability of a limited number of frequency bands, which eases the development of the necessary equipment and facilitates faster preparation of tests and trials. As of standardization, 5G PPP projects contribute to 5G standards development by building consensus among European industry, leading to individual and concerted actions towards standardization bodies. In contrast to early announcements of 5G deployments, the 5G results are aligned with the standardization trends in 3GPP, ensuring a global impact of European 5G innovations. Once the first 5G standards are released and the frequency bands are available, deployments of 5G networks will start, adopting cost efficient upgrade paths building on existing 4G infrastructure. Networking and processing resource sharing strategies between stakeholders can be implemented for delivering the performance targets, e.g. for URLLC use cases, at an affordable cost. This resource sharing/integration is enabled by the multi-domain orchestration advocated by 5G PPP projects and aim at achieving win-win situations for all the stakeholders involved in the 5G service. Regulation must facilitate such flexibility in infrastructure sharing in order to foster the development of the 5G digital business ecosystem.",['info']
Multi-criteria agro-environmental evaluation of low input dairy farming systemsEvaluation agro-environnementale multi critères des données laitières des systèmes agricoles,"A multi-criteria evaluation was carried out to evaluate the agro-environmental sustainability of the two low input dairy farming systems, permanent meadows system (SH) and mixed crops-meadows system (SPCE), of the experimental farm of INRA-Mirecourt. Twelve environmental indicators from different methods (INDIGO, Peigné 2003, PLANETE) were calculated in order to evaluate the impact on abiotic resources : nitrate leaching, phosphorus losses, pesticides loss in surface and groundwater, pesticides loss in the air, ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide emission soil organic matter content, phophorus availability and non-renewable energy use. Indicator results were ranked on a scale from 0 to 10, where 7 is the tolerance value. Indicators were aggregated into four main criteria (water and air pollution risk, soil quality and energy consumption), weighted and attributes a qualitative ranking scale with the tool DEXI. Data were collected at plot and farm scale for the period 2007-2008. The first results of this evaluation showed that SH has a ""very high"" and SPCE a ""medium to high"" agro-environmental sustainability. The impact on abiotic resources is ""very low"" for SH and ""medium to low"" for SPCE. However both systems had a medium to low impact on water pollution, soil quality and energy consumption. Air pollution obtained the worst result '""medium to bad"" impact, due to high GHG emission for both systems. In fact the indicators of nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide emission obtained respectively a score of 5.8, 2.9 and 7.5 for SH, and 6.8, 4.2 and 6.4 for SPCE. These results correspond to an emission amount of 2 kg N2O/ha, 105.7 kg CH4/ha and 0.2 t CO2/ha for SH, and 1.6 kg N2O/ha, 74.1 kg CH4/ha and 0.3 t CO2/ha for SPCE. These results underline the role of dairy farming on global GHG emission, especially of methane emission from enteric fermentation. All other indicators yielded a score above the tolerance value, excepted nitrate leaching (6.9) and ammonia volatilization (6.9) for SPCE. Further work should be carried out in order to validate the proposed indicators and aggregation.Une évaluation multi-critères a été effectuée pour évaluer la durabilité agro-environnementale de deux systèmes agricoles laitiers à faibles intrants : système permanent de prairies (SH) et système de culture mixte prairie (SPCE) à la ferme expérimentale de l'INRA-Mirecourt. Douze indicateurs environnementaux de différentes méthodes (INDIGO, Peigné 2003, PLANETE) ont été calculés afin d'évaluer l'impact sur les ressources abiotiques: le lessivage des nitrates, les pertes de phosphore, la perte de pesticides dans les eaux superficielles et souterraines, la perte de pesticides dans l'air, volatilisation de l'ammoniac, de protoxyde d'azote , le méthane et le dioxyde de carbone dans le sol, émissions de matière organique, la disponibilité de phosphore et d'énergie non renouvelable. Les résultats des indicateurs ont été classés sur une échelle de 0 à 10, où 7 est la valeur de tolérance. Les indicateurs ont été regroupés en quatre principaux critères (l'eau et le risque de pollution de l'air, la qualité du sol et la consommation d'énergie), pondérés et attribue une échelle de classement qualitative avec l'outil DEXI. Les données ont été recueillies pour la période 2007-2008. Les premiers résultats de cette évaluation de la durabilité agro-environnementalement ont montré que SH est évalué à «très élevé» et SPCE à «moyen à élevé». L'impact sur les ressources abiotiques est «très faible» pour SH et «moyen à faible» pour SPCE. Cependant, les deux systèmes ont eu une incidence moyenne à faible sur la pollution de l'eau, qualité des sols et la consommation d'énergie. La pollution atmosphérique a obtenu le plus mauvais résultat ""moyen à mauvais"" en terme d'émission de gaz à effet de serre élevé pour les deux systèmes. En fait, les indicateurs d'oxyde de diazote, d'émission de méthane et de dioxyde de carbone ont obtenu respectivement un score de 5,8, 2,9 et 7,5 pour SH, et de 6,8, 4,2 et 6,4 pour SPCE. Ces résultats correspondent à une quantité d'émission de 2 kg N2O/ha, 105.7 kg CH4/ha et 0,2 t CO2/ha pour SH, et 1,6 kg N2O/ha, 74.1 kg et 0,3 t CH4/ha CO2/ha pour SPCE. Ces résultats soulignent le rôle de l'élevage laitier sur des émissions de gaz à effet de serre au niveau mondial, en particulier des émissions de méthane provenant de la fermentation entérique. Tous les autres indicateurs a donné un score supérieur à la valeur de tolérance, excepté le lessivage des nitrates (6,9) et volatilisation de l'ammoniac (6,9) pour SPCE. D'autres travaux doivent être effectués afin de valider les indicateurs proposés et d'agrégation.","['sdv', 'sde']"
Optimization and lifecycle engineering for design and manufacture of recycled aluminium parts,"Aluminium alloys components are numerous in aeronautic and automobile structures. Despite having interesting mechanical properties for lightweight solutions, the extraction of virgin aluminium still has negative impacts on the environment. A solution is to use an increased rate of recycled aluminium in structural parts. This requires a global optimisation of the part design and manufacture. The proposed work details the advanced optimization techniques used for product and process design integrating environmental concerns. The methodology is implemented and tested on an industrial case that results in a recycling rate of 75% in high-end structural component based on wrought aluminium alloys.",['spi']
NOAA Marine Geophysical Data and a GEBCO Grid for the Topographical Analysis of Japanese Archipelago by Means of GRASS GIS and GDAL Library,"This article analyzes topographical and geological settings in the Japan Ar‐ chipelago for comparative raster data processing using GRASS GIS. Data in‐ clude bathymetric and geological grids in NetCDF format: GEBCO, EMAG2, GlobSed, marine free‐air gravity anomaly and EGM96. Data were imported to GRASS by gdalwarp utility of GDAL and projected via PROJ library. Method‐ ology includes data processing (projecting and import), mapping and spatial analysis. Visualization was done by shell scripting using a sequence of GRASS modules: ‘d.shade’ for relief mapping, ‘r.slope.aspect’; for modelling based on DEM, ‘r.contour’ for plotting isolines, ‘r.mapcalc’ for classification, ‘r.category’ for associating labels, and auxiliary modules (d.vect, d.rast, d.grid, d.legend). The results of the geophysical visualization show that marine free‐air gravi‐ tational anomalies vary in the Sea of Japan (–30 to above 40 mGal) reflecting density inhomogeneities of the tectonic structure, and correlating with the geo‐ logical structure of the seafloor. Dominating values of geoid model are 30–45 m reflecting West Pacific rise, determined by deep density inhomogeneities as‐ sociated with the mantle convention. Sediment thickness varies across the sea reflecting its geological development with density of 2 km in its deepest part and thinner in central part (Yamato Rise). The aspect map and reclassified map express gradient of the steepest descent.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"

Safe Systems Programming in Rust: The Promise and the Challenge,"• Rust is the first industry-supported programming language to overcome the longstanding tradeoff between the safety guarantees of higher-level languages (like Java) and the control over resource management provided by lower-level ""systems programming"" languages (like C and C++). • It tackles this challenge using a strong type system based on the ideas of ownership and borrowing, which statically prohibits the mutation of shared state. This approach enables many common systems programming pitfalls to be detected at compile time. • There are a number of data types whose implementations fundamentally depend on shared mutable state and thus cannot be typechecked according to Rust’s strict ownership discipline. To support such data types, Rust embraces the judicious use of unsafe code encapsulated within safe APIs. • The proof technique of semantic type soundness, together with advances in separation logic and machine-checked proof, has enabled us to begin building rigorous formal foundations for Rust as part of the RustBelt project.",['info']
"PATHWAYS OF SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT ACROSS CHINA THE CASES OF HANGZHOU, DATONG AND ZHUHAI","This e-book gives an overview of the research work carried out within the framework of the MEDIUM project.

Safety evaluation of a beta‐amylase food enzyme obtained from wheat (Triticum spp.),"The food enzyme considered in this opinion is a beta-amylase (EC 3.2.1.2), obtained from the grain of wheat (Triticum spp.) by Roquette (France). The beta-amylase is intended to be used in starch processing for production of glucose syrups containing maltose to be used as a food ingredient. Since the presence of residual amounts of total organic solids (TOS) in glucose syrups after filtration and purification during starch processing is negligible, no dietary exposure was calculated. As the food enzyme is derived from edible parts of wheat, no toxicological tests are required. Wheat is known as a gluten-containing cereal. However, the gluten content of the food enzyme was shown to be below the limit of quantification of the applied analytical method and well below the threshold value of 20 mg/kg for 'gluten-free' products. Furthermore, the potential allergenicity was evaluated by searching for similarity between the amino acid sequence of the beta-amylase and the sequences of known food allergens; no match was found. Although b-amylase from wheat is described as a potential occupational respiratory allergen, and oral wheat challenges in wheat allergic patients may result in clinical symptoms, the enzyme and the low levels of other wheat proteins will be removed from the final food ingredients through a downstream purification process. Based on the origin of the food enzyme from edible parts of grain, the manufacturing process, and the compositional and biochemical data provided, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use.",['sdv']

Nicolas de Condorcet. The revolution of French higher education.,"This Springer brief explores the contribution of Nicolas de Condorcet in French higher education, the historical development of his work and its influence on the history of the French education system. Condorcet's educational proposals were first devised as five Memoires, which were consolidated into the 'Rapport et Projet de Decret sur l'Organisation Generale de l'Instruction Publique'. This report has sparked debate on the subject of education in the past and lives on as a basis for ongoing iterations of plans for education by other writers. In developing these ideas and especially how they apply to higher education, this book bridges the gap between the 18th century French Enlightenment shift and the Revolution of higher education, with the advent of the Grandes Écoles such as École Normale Supérieure, École Polytechnique and Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers. Each of these schools was represented by a specific institutionalized educational idea rooted in the works of the philosopher. This book offers insights to a wider audience in the educational thought of Condorcet, which at the time of his writing was overshadowed by Rousseau, and shows how his ideas of liberty and equality flourish in the French educational system and remain an important part in today's French academic, cultural and political culture.",['shs']
A three-level signature by graph for Reverse Engineering of mechanical assemblies,"Several approaches exist to provide Reverse Engineering solutions on mechanical parts. Mechanical assemblies and the expertise information retrieved at the same time with the model geometry are not really taken into account in the literature. Thus, the main challenge of this contribution is to propose a methodology to retrieve the Digital Mock-Up of a mechanical assembly from its meshed data (from digitalization). The output DMU consists of expertise information and parameterized CAD models. The methodology proposed relies on a signature by a three-level graph. It enables to provide an adequate level of details by identifying the corresponding functional surfaces in meshed data. The first-level graph is a connectivity graph; the intermediate level is the same as the first with the geometric type of face added to each node (plane, cylinder and sphere) and the deepest level corresponds to a precedence graph. This one provides information such as functional surfaces and position between them (perpendicularity, coaxiality etc.). The solutions developed and the results are presented in this paper. The methodology is illustrated thanks to an industrial use-case with a scan of an assembly with a connecting rod and a piston. The conclusion and perspectives will complete this paper.","['info', 'spi']"
Perceptions of Tech-Augmented Learning in Basic Mathematics among University Students: A Case of Matrix Algebra Tools,"This study adopted Survey research design.The Tech-Augmented Learning Questionnaire (TALQ) was used as the instrument for data collection from sixty (60) first-year students enrolled on the course at a Federal University in North Central Nigeria.

Classification of large wildfires in South-Eastern France to adapt suppression strategiesClassification des grands incendies dans le sud-est de la France pour adapter la stratégie de suppression,"Large wildfires keep on developing in the French Mediterranean region, regularly threatening responders. We tested if these large fires could be classified into types, and if these types were representative of different environmental drivers. To proceed, we established a database comprising 153 of the largest fires from the last 25 years. For each fire we collected three datasets to describe the environment, the fire behaviour and the control operations. We performed a hierarchical clustering analysis followed by a predictive analysis with Bootstrap Regression Trees. Fires were classified in 8 types that could a posteriori be reduced to 5 types. The One-way type was featured by moderate environmental parameters, the Multi-way type was featured by slope, the Winding and Rapid types were featured by wind, while the Very large type was featured by the drought code. Moreover, the probability of having vehicles trapped in a large fire was primarily correlated with the number of vehicles assigned for suppression. This study provides the basis for upcoming trainings of Fire Analyst in France. It paves the way for further research on predictive wildfire danger mapping.",['sde']

Simultaneously, it proposes the most significant parameters for each activity of the considered process pattern. The framework is applied on a specific design example and is partially implemented.","['info', 'spi']"
Service software engineering for innovative infrastructure for global financial services,"The recent financial crisis motivates our re-thinking of the engineering principles for service software and infrastructures intended to create business value in vital sectors. Existing monolithic, inwarddirected, cost insensitive and highly regulated technical and organizational infrastructures for financial services make it difficult for the domain to benefit from opportunities offered by new computing models such as cloud computing, software as a service, hardware as a service, and utility computing.

Sustainability performance evaluation for selecting the Best Recycling Pathway During its Design Phase,"As the end of life products are becoming more and more complex, the recycling systems encountered many difficulties in valuing all the materials contained in each product. This involves not only recovering a large number of materials but also doing so with the minimal environmental impact. Although the benefits of recycling are well established, the industrial processes need to be designed in regard with their environmental impacts. That is why recyclers need robust assessment tools to make the right choices during the design of recycling processes. This evaluation’s work should enable them to choose the right recycling solutions for a wide range of end of life products.

"Grapevines can survive with little water, but wine glasses could still go dry during droughts","A new study pushed grapevines to the brink of dehydration to find out how much water they need to survive. Grapevines are drought resistant enough that California’s wineries may be able to dial back the irrigation and keep their plants alive, new research says. That’s good news as the state heads into what looks to be another dry year. There is a catch, however: while the study suggests vines might survive a thirsty spell with minimal watering, it doesn’t say if they’ll still make enough grapes to keep wine glasses full.",['sdv']

Making Cloud-based Systems Elasticity Testing Reproducible,"Elastic cloud infrastructures vary computational resources at runtime, i. e., elasticity, which is error-prone. That makes testing throughout elasticity crucial for those systems. Those errors are detected thanks to tests that should run deterministically many times all along the development. However, elasticity testing reproduction requires several features not supported natively by the main cloud providers, such as Amazon EC2. We identify three requirements that we claim to be indispensable to ensure elasticity testing reproducibility: to control the elasticity behavior, to select specic resources to be unallocated, and coordinate events parallel to elasticity. In this paper, we propose an approach fullling those requirements and making the elasticity testing reproducible. To validate our approach, we perform three experiments on representative bugs, where our approach succeeds in reproducing all the bugs.",['info']

WHY ONLINE PRIVACY IS NOT DEAD: NEGOTIATION AND CONFLICT IN SOCIAL MEDIA,"This is a summary of results from a larger research project on online privacy. It discussed the "" end of privacy "" theme in current political and scientific debates about the internet. Beyond unprecedented intrusion by governments and corporations, the analysis focuses on individuals themselves, and the conditions under which they share contents on social media. Contrary to received wisdom, they are not animated by a mindless appetite for openness and self-disclosure; rather, social media users continuously negotiate their privacy among themselves and with service providers. Their approach to online sharing is more strategic and controlled than commonly thought, and the public outcry after the Snowden scandals is just one episode in a long series of lively controversies.","['info', 'shs']"
"A stereoselective method for the synthesis of enantiopure 3-substituted 4-hydroxyproline derivatives via 1,3-Dipolar cycloadditions","The stereoselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between (Z)-1,4-dichloro-2-butene and a menthone-derived nitrone led to the corresponding isoxazolidine. Regioselective azidation of a single chlorine atom followed by another Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) induced enantiopure 1,2,3-triazolyl-functionalized isoxazolidines. The subsequent acidic cleavage of the menthone chiral auxiliary and reductive cleavage of the isoxazolidine N–O bond triggered an intramolecular cyclization through the displacement of the second chlorine. This rapid and stereoselective synthetic strategy provided reliable access to a series of enantiopure 3-substituted 4-hydroxyproline derivatives.","['sdv', 'chim']"

Localized necking in elastomer-supported metal layers: impact of kinematic hardening,"The present paper deals with localized necking in stretched metal sheets using the initial imperfection approach. The first objective is to study the effect of kinematic hardening on the formability of a freestanding metal layer. To this end, the behavior of the metal layer is assumed to follow the rigid-plastic rate-independent flow theory. The isotropic (resp. kinematic) hardening of this metal is modeled by the Hollomon (resp. Prager) law. A parametric study is carried out in order to investigate the effect of kinematic hardening on the formability limits. It is shown that the effect of kinematic hardening on the ductility limit is noticeably different depending on the strain path considered. The second aim of the paper is to analyze the effect of an elastomer substrate, perfectly bonded to the metal layer, on the formability of the whole bilayer. It is found that the addition of an elastomer layer substantially enhances the formability of the bilayer, in agreement with earlier studies.",['spi']
Study of Pansharpening Methods Applied to Hyperspectral Images of Sediment Cores,"Spectroscopic and imaging sensors are very useful methods in analytical chemistry because they are fast, cost effective, very informative analysis. Recent works search to fused them to create a new sensor with different spectral range to increase spectral and thus chemical information to create robust and precise prediction models. Remote sensing already used fusion methods to increase spatial resolution for spectral sensors. In this paper, we propose to use pixel level data fusion methods on laboratory sensors to check their availability to increase spatial information with low effect on both dimensions (spectral and spatial). The methodology presents two steps, first the registration to fit spatially the sensors and then the fusion step to estimate each sensor at the optimal resolution. The proposed method was used on three sediment cores, that are living sample which can move, crack. They are imaged sequentially with two sensors that do not overlap spectrally: visible near infrared VNIR (400-1000 nm, pixel size: 60 μm), short wave infrared SWIR (1000-2500 nm, pixel size: 190 μm). The registration step allows to have a correlation above 0.9 with still spatial defect bring by the samples that cannot be removed. The twenty-one state of the art pixel level data fusion methods seems to be less relevant than a bicubic interpolation for the case of the laboratory hyperspectral images of sediment cores.","['info', 'math', 'chim']"
Change analysis using multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR images,"Multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are suitable and useful for analyzing changes on the Earth’s surface due to the operation in all-time and all weather conditions of SAR system. Change detection methods can be used in a wide range of applications, such as environmental monitoring, agricultural surveys, urban studies, forest monitoring etc. The ESA Sentinel-1 European Radar Observatory is the constellation of two C-band radar satellites providing SAR images in single and dual polarization for different acquisition modes: Strip Map (SM), Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Extra Wide Swath (EW) with a repeat cycle of 12 days (1 satellite) or 6 days (2 satellites).

Change analysis of dual polarimetric Sentinel-1 SAR image time series using stationary wavelet transform and change detection matrix,"Change detection is a difficult task which intends to determine the changes of specific features within a certain time interval. These change features are various and come from different causes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is particularly appropriate for change detection thanks to the data acquisition possibility independently of Sun illumination and cloud coverage of SAR system. The launch of new generation satellites allows to collect SAR image time series of fine spatial/temporal resolution images from repeat-pass orbits. The Sentinel-1 SAR data are recently supplied free of charge for all data users, thus opening new opportunities and challenges to process new data. This paper provides initial change detection results on a time series of 10 dual polarimetric IW level-1 single look complex (SLC) Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired in descending pass over Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, France.

INTERGEO – A DIGITAL PLATFORM FOR EDUCATION TO GEOMORPHOSITES,"The working group on Geomorphosites of the International Association of Geomorphologists (IAG) is active since 2001 and has developed research activities on issues related to the geomorphological heritage (geomorphosites) [1]. In parallel to the research activities, several intensive courses for Ph.D. and Master students have been organized since 2006 in various universities (Lausanne, Lesvos, Minho, Savoie, Beni Mellal) and a textbook for students was edited in 2009 [2]. The platform INTERGEO is prepared as a way to disseminate knowledge on geomorphological heritage, in particular in universities of developing countries where access to scientific papers and textbooks is not easy. It aims at improving students' autonomy by the reduction of frontal teaching and increasing autonomous learning as well as promoting international interactions between students interested in geomorphosite topics. The course, developed with the Learning Management System Moodle, is a completely free-access course. It is divided into four parts: (1) Generalities – definitions, links with heritage and landscape studies, active geomorphosites, the IAG working group; (2) Methods – selection and assessment, mapping issues, geomorphosite visualization, technical and digital tools in geomorphosite studies; (3) Conservation and promotion – example of geomorphosite studies related to geoconservation, geoparks, protected areas, World Heritage Sites, geotourism and interpretation, and natural hazards; (4) Examples – cultural, karstic, coastal, mountainous, fluvial, volcanic and anthropogenic geomorphosites. Each chapter contains a short description, a list of references, selected publications, as well as other educational material, e.g. videos, virtual fieldtrips, etc. The content of the course will evolve and will be completed in the future. The content is currently being prepared and will be tested by the six universities involved in the project during the academic year 2015–2016. Each university will use INTERGEO as a support for the specific courses on geoconservation and geomorphological heritage. Each team will then carry out fieldwork and will exchange on the results during a virtual international conference to be organized in Summer 2016 (the various teams will interact by video-conferences). The course will then be fully open-access by September 2016.","['phys', 'sde', 'shs']"

Domain of attraction estimation of cancer chemotherapy model affected by state proportional uncertainty,This paper proposes an analytical method for the characterization of the set of all initial tumor and normal states of a cancer dynamical model for which there exists a successful drug administration therapy. The dynamical model considered simulates the behavior of the tumor and the normal cells populations growth in presence of a chemotherapy drug. This model is assumed to be affected by a state proportional uncertainty. The successful drug administration therapy is attained by respecting the tumor eradication and avoiding the lower admissible bound of the normal cells population which is viewed as an indicator of the patients health. The problem is posed in terms of domain of attraction computation and is solved by applying set theory and invariance tools.,"['math', 'spi']"

Image processing using proper orthogonal and dynamic mode decompositions for the study of cavitation developing on a NACA0015 foil,"The purpose of the present study is to get a better understanding of the hydrodynamic instabilities of sheet cavities which develop along solid walls. The main objective is to highlight the spatial and temporal behavior of such a cavity when it develops on a NACA0015 foil at high Reynolds number. Experimental results show a quasi-steady, periodic, bifurcation domain, with aperiodic cavity behavior corresponding to σ/2α values of 5.75, 5, 4.3 and 3.58. Robust mathematical methods of signal postprocessing (proper orthogonal decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition) were applied in order to emphasize the spatio-temporal nature of the flow. These new techniques put in evidence the 3D effects due to the reentrant jet instabilities or due to propagating shock wave mechanism at the origin of the shedding process of the cavitation cloud.",['spi']
(A new time of flight) Acoustic flow meter using wide band signals and adaptive beamforming techniques,"In this paper we present the result of our research concerning the improvement ofacoustic time of flight flow metering for water pipes. Current flow meters are based on theestimation of direct time of flight by matched filtering of the received and emitted signals byacoustic transducers. Currently, narrow band signals are used, as well as a single emitter/receptortransducer configuration. Although simple, this configuration presents a series of limitationssuch as energy losses due to pipe wall/water interface, pressure/flow transients, sensitivity toflow induced vibrations, acoustic beam deformations and shift due to changes in flow velocityand embedded turbulence in the flow. The errors associated with these limitations reduce theoverall robustness of existing flow meters, as well as the measured flow rate range and loweraccuracy. In order to overcome these limitations, two major innovations were implemented atthe signal processing level. The first one concerns the use of wide band signals that optimise thepower transfer throughout the acoustic path and also increase the number of velocity/flowreadings per second. Using wide band signals having a high duration-bandwidth productincreases the precision in terms of time of flight measurements and, in the same time, improvesthe system robustness. The second contribution consists in the use of a multiple emitter – multiple receivers configuration (for one path) in order to compensate the emitted acoustic beamshift, compensate the time of flight estimation errors and thus increase the flow meter’srobustness in case of undesired effects such as the “flow blow” and transient/rapid flowrate/velocity changes. Using a new signal processing algorithm that take advantage of thecontrolled wide band content coming from multiple receivers, the new flow meters achieves ahigher accuracy in terms of flow velocity over a wider velocity range than existing systems.Tests carried out on real scale experimental facility showed an increase in acoustic time of flightestimation, accuracy of 50% with respect to the existing measurements techniques based onlyon signal correlation.",['spi']
Compensation of position offset of acoustic transducers using compressive sensing concept,"This paper presents a new technique for acoustic transducers position offset compensation, based on compressive sensing reconstruction in the warped domain. In underwater acoustics, the transducers relative position is important for applications involving direction of arrival estimation, localization or source detection. When the transmitter-receiver transducers configuration is inappropriate, the received signal's informational content is not the same as the one of the emitted signal. In the case of applications such as underwater objects tracking, the experimental setup constraints and the water flow operational conditions lead to the perturbation of the emitted and received signals propagation. We use compressive sensing reconstruction of the received signal, in the warped domain, in order to recover its missing spectral information due to wave's propagation. Tests were conducted in a reduced scale experimental facility, in order to prove the interest of using the signal compressive sensing recovery for the signal's time of arrival estimation and to quantify the improvement introduced by this signal processing method. The results show that the time of arrival estimation can be considerably improved after the received signal's samples recovery, with the matched filter response improvement.","['math', 'spi']"
Flow velocity profiling using acoustic time of flight flow metering based on wide band signals and adaptive beam-forming techniques,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to non-intrusive flow velocity profilingtechnique using multi-element sensor array and wide-band signal’s processing methods. Conventional techniques for the measurements of the flow velocity profiles are usually basedon intrusive instruments (current meters, acoustic Doppler profilers, Pitot tubes, etc.) that takepunctual velocity readings. Although very efficient, these choices are limited in terms ofpractical cases of applications especially when non-intrusive measurements techniques arerequired and/or a spatial accuracy of the velocity profiling is required This is due to factorsrelated to hydraulic machinery down time, the often long time duration needed to explore theentire section area, the frequent cumbersome number of devices that needs to be handledsimultaneously, or the impossibility to perform intrusive tests. In the case of non-intrusive flowprofiling methods based on acoustic techniques, previous methods concentrated on using alarge number of acoustic transducers placed around the measured section. Although feasible,this approach presents several major drawbacks such as a complicated signal timing,transmission, acquisition and recording system, resulting in a relative high cost of operation. Inaddition, because of the geometrical constraints, a desired number of sensors may not beinstalled. Recent results in acoustic flow metering based on wide band signals and adaptivebeamforming proved that it is possible to achieve flow velocity profiles using less acoustictransducers. In a normal acoustic time of flight path the transducers are both emitters andreceivers, sequentially changing their roles. In the new configuration, proposed in this paper, two new receivers are added on each side. Since the beam angles of each acoustic transducerare wide enough the newly added transducers can receive the transmitted signals and additionaltime of flight estimation can be done. Thus, several flow velocities are possible to becomputed. Analytically defined emitted wide band signals makes possible the identification ofsignals coming from each transducer. Using the adaptive beam-forming algorithm thereceiving transducers can record different signals from the receiver, equivalent to differentpropagation paths. Therefore, different measurements of time of flight are possible, leading toadditional flow velocity measurements. Results carried out in an experiment facility belongingto ICPE-CA, Bucharest - Romania allowed to the validation of the flow velocities computedusing this new technique, in symmetric, asymmetric and uneven flow conditions. The acousticderived values were referenced with those provided from a Pitot tube probe installed in the testchannel and the results obtained by the method proposed in this paper are relatively close tothis reference.",['spi']
Exploring Gender Differences in Graduation Proficiency in Mathematics Education Using a Markov Chain Model: Implications for Economic Growth in Nigeria,"This study employs an ex-post facto research design to explore the fluctuations of gender difference in academic achievement among graduating students of mathematics education. Graduation statistics for a total of 1106 graduating students of mathematics education (923 males and 183 females) from a University in North Central Nigeria were used to design a discrete-time Markov chain model for the movement of the difference (d) in graduating proficiency from one range of values (states) to the other. Additional goodness of fit test (χ 2 = 1.731, p = 0.99924) and t-test (t = 0.4055, p = 0.6852) unveiled that d has stayed much the same over the 12 graduation cycles used in the study, and that whatever factors determine the difference in academic achievement between male and female graduating students of mathematics education on a graduation cycle basis have remained much the same over the years. Further analysis of the model predicted the closure of the observed gender gap in the next 15 graduation cycles (p 15). The results of this study has specifically highlighted the fact that female graduates of mathematics education are as proficient as their male counterparts in driving value added services in and beyond the education sub-sector of the Nigerian economy. Based on the findings of this study, it was recommended that future work may consider an in-depth investigation of the sensitivity of parameters that may have influenced specific probabilities given in the model.","['math', 'shs']"

Lies of the reader: Disadvantages of the sociological research methods for the study of the reading,"The research problems of this study are the difficulties in the explanation of the phenomenon of reading in its accelerated transformations by quantitative sociological methods, because of failure to comply with a number of factors: first, the social aspects of the purchase, consumption and possession of reading materials have not yet been reading; second, reading is both asocial and social activity; third, the reader is not social status, social class, social group or social role. Author's hypothesis: the most accessible and authoritative audience methods for study of the reading – sociological research methods, are unable to disclose the specifics of the reader and reading, they provide limited data only on the outer side of the reading activity, for its quantitative indicators but do not reach to the knowledge about the nature and the reasons both for the reading and not reading. The object of this study is the use of sociological research methods in the study of the reader and the reading. The purpose is to reveal the problems generated by the classical sociological research methods, which fed up the mainstream negativity towards the contemporary reading and hinder his objective knowledge. Methodology/approach: The study was conducted by critical analytical and synthetic approach, which involves a systematic review, comparative analysis of terminology and concepts and educational integrated research on the topic ""Does my microgroup read?"" among Bulgarians over 14 years (2003–2017). Findings: There have been found 15 disadvantages of the sociological methods of the study of reading, as a result of which, science can get a false picture of the reading situation of local and global level. These disadvantages are as follows: 1) research vs. survey, 2) sociological propaganda, 3) the effect of the crowd, 4) fear from the reader, 5) unrecognition of snobbery towards reading and the books, 6) connotations of the word ""reading"" , 7) literature vs. book, 8) the index ""free time"" , 9) reading in the consumer modality, 10) reading as demonstrative consumption, 11) undefined ""reader"" , 12) the respondent lie, 13) the respondent resistance, 14) the prejudice ""compulsory for reading"" , 15) absence of axiological balance. As an alternative to the sociological methods for obtaining of objective results in the study of the reading and the readers is proposed the integrated approach between qualitative sociological methods and the methods of cognitive neuroscience and bibliopsychology.","['math', 'shs']"

Proposition and Validation of a Questionnaire to Measure the User Experience in Immersive Virtual Environments,"There are increasing new advances in Virtual Reality technologies as well as a rise in Immersive Virtual Environments research and in User eXperience research. Within this framework, we decided to address the overall user experience in Immersive virtual environments. Indeed, in our point of view, this topic is not fully dealt with in the scientific literature, neither in terms of user experience components nor in terms of user experience measurement methods. It is in this context that we conducted a study aiming at proposing and validating a unified questionnaire on User eXperience in Immersive Virtual Environment. Our questionnaire contains 10 scales measuring presence, engagement, immersion, flow, usability, skill, emotion, experience consequence, judgement and technology adoption. Scale construction was based on existing questionnaires. Our questionnaire was tested on 116 participants after they use the edutainment Virtual Environment “Think and Shoot”. The number of participants allows us to assess the reliability and the sensitivity of our questionnaire. Results show that 9 out of 10 subscales and 68 out of 87 items are reliable as demonstrated by an internal consistency analysis with Cronbach’s alpha and an item analysis. Findings also indicate that the scale scores from 6 subscales are considered normal distributed (e.g. presence) whereas the scale scores from 3 subscales are considered negatively skewed (e.g. skill).",['shs']

Fifteen years later, the publication of The New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness marks a new phase. This massive attention this study received in the media shows that the negative effects of artificial lighting are no longer only a problem for experts: this is now a public problem. This study also shows that, when trying to quantify light pollution, it is hard to go beyond the artificial indicator of “whether we can see the Milky Way with the naked eye.” This standard has been inherited from the history of struggles against light pollution by amateur astronomers. This new atlas of artificial lighting offers us the occasion to explore how urban lighting was transformed into an environmental problem with global impact, and to bring to light the solutions that are currently proposed, especially in France.","['sde', 'shs']"

"Private labels, national brands and food prices","We study the relationships between national brand prices and the development of private labels, using home-scanned data from a consumer survey reporting purchases for 218 food products. In a significant number of cases (144 out of 218), we observe a positive correlation (89%) between brand price and purchases of private labels. When controlling for changes in the products quality, we still find a positive relation between private label development and national brand prices. Thus, the change in the national brand product characteristics only partly explains the increase in the national brand prices. Furthermore, the price reactions of national brands differ according to the type of private labels they are facing. Finally, we demonstrate that the development of private labels has less effect on the prices of second-tier brands than prices of the leading brand.",['shs']
Robust frontier estimation from noisy data: a Tikhonov regularization approach,"In stochastic frontier models, the regression function defines the production frontier and the regression errors are assumed to be composite. The actually observed outputs are assumed to be contaminated by a stochastic noise. The additive regression errors are composed from this noise term and the one-sided inefficiency term. The aim is to construct a robust nonparametric estimator for the production function. The main tool is a robust concept of partial, expected maximum production frontier, defined as a special probability-weighted moment. In contrast to the deterministic one-sided error model where robust partial frontier modeling is fruitful, the composite error problem requires a substantial different treatment based on deconvolution techniques. To ensure the identifiability of the model, it is sufficient to assume an independent Gaussian noise. In doing so, the frontier estimation necessitates the computation of a survival function estimator from an illposed equation. A Tikhonov regularized solution is constructed and nonparametric frontier estimation is performed. The asymptotic properties of the obtained survival function and frontier estimators are established. Practical guidelines to effect the necessary computations are described via a simulated example. The usefulness of the approach is discussed through two concrete data sets from the sector of Delivery Services.",['shs']
Dynamics of plastic deformation based on restoring and energy dissipative mechanisms in plasticity,"The dynamics of plasticity is considered based on the field theoretical approach developed by physical mesomechanics. The equation of motion governing mesoscopic volume elements in plastically deforming media is derived from the mesomechanical field equation. Theoretical analysis on this equation of motion indicates that in the plastic regime solid-state media exert two types of forces; the restoring force and energy dissipating force. The former is associated with the shear modulus, and causes the displacement field to be oscillatory. The latter is associated with a quantity analogous to the electric charge, and causes the displacement field to be decaying. Experimental observations that support these theoretical considerations are presented.",['spi']
Experimental and Theoretical Study of Multiscale Damage-Failure Transition in Very High Cycle Fatigue,"Multiscale mechanisms of failure of metals (Armco iron, titanium, aluminum) are studied for high cycle and very high cycle fatigue. By correlating with the results of structural studies, a theoretical approach is developed to describe fatigue crack kinetics in damaged material under high cycle and very high cycle fatigue loading conditions. Stages of crack nucleation and propagation are analyzed using the profilometry data from the fracture surface. The scale invariance of fracture surface roughness is established, which allows an explanation of the self-similar nature of fatigue crack kinetics under high cycle and very high cycle fatigue. Variation of elastic-plastic properties of Armco iron under very high cycle fatigue is studied using an acoustic resonance method. It is found that the material density decreases during fatigue damage accumulation, with the minimum of the material density in the bulk of the specimen.",['spi']
Location Determination in Online Social Network Profiles.,"In online social networks individuals are given the option to reveal on their online profiles some personal information about themselves including, among others, their home loca- tion that, if specified, is typically referred to with a toponym. A toponym disclosed by an individual on her profile, or self- reported toponym (e.g., “London”), is often ambiguous and may be interpreted as the name of different geographic lo- cations (“London, U.K.”, “London, Ontario, Canada”, “Lon- don, Arkansas, USA”). The determination of the right inter- pretation of a self-reported toponym is challenging because the profile of an individual usually lacks the contextual in- formation that can be used to disambiguate the toponym. In this paper, we propose LocusRank, an algorithm for the disambiguation (or resolution) of the self-reported to- ponyms in online social network profiles. More precisely, Lo- cusRankchooses the right interpretation of a self-reported toponym of an individual by using the (possibly ambigu- ous) self-reported toponyms of her friends. Besides, Locus- Rankcan also be used to infer with good accuracy the home location of profiles that do not even have a self-reported to- ponym. We evaluated LocusRankwith good results on a dataset of profiles obtained from two real social networks, namely Flickr and LiveJournal.",['info']
Collaboration within the Surgical Suite : BoardProbe Design For and With the Surgical TeamCollaboration au sein du Bloc Operatoire : BoardProbe Design Pour et Avec l'Equipe Chirurgicale,"The expectations of computerizing hospitals are high, in the belief that it will improve health care quality, reduce costs, and increase administrative efficiency. However, effective computerization of hospitals is a real challenge. The explanations of this failure are typical of HCI misdesign. In this paper, we focus on the computer support of the activity within the surgical suite.

New technology to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic cells for producing energy,"Due to increasing worldwide energy needs, several technologies have been elaborated to meet this demand. One of these developments concerns solar energy, which has already been in use for several decades. The main solar technologies were developed in the sixties and seventies with monocrystalline and multicrystalline technologies. Subsequently, a new, more efficient, technology with a ribbon system became available. These different technologies have similar processes and applications. Several Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies have been carried out to identify and to compare the environmental impacts of photovoltaic systems and nuclear systems, lignite systems etc. These studies have shown that the main problem with photovoltaic technologies is the decreasing efficiency during the using phase, and that is why some impacts appear higher when compared to other technologies. However, in order to justify the benefits of this new technology, it is necessary to assess environmental impacts and to compare them with the conventional technologies. The second challenge in this research work is to carry out the LCA. Our proposal shows the preliminary LCA results of this technology, but it also indicates the difficulties and the limitations of assessing the environmental impact of such products. Even if standards, tools and databases exist for completing the LCA, nano-products are quite new and a full LCA study is difficult to conduct due to the lack of information in the actual databases of the Life Cycle Inventory and the characterization factors in the calculation methods.","['sde', 'spi']"
Freshwater Sediment Characterization Factors of Copper Oxide Nanoparticles,"Wide use of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) is likely to result in the eventually accumulation of ENPs in sediment. The benthic organisms living in sediments may suffer relatively high toxic effects of ENPs. This study has selected copper oxide nanoparticles (nano-CuO) as a research object. To consider the impacts of spatial heterogeneity on ENPs toxicity, the characterization factor (CF) derived from life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is used as an indicator in this study. A nano-specific fate model has been used to calculate the freshwater sediment fate factor (FF) of nano-CuO. A literature survey of the nano-CuO toxicology values has been performed to calculate the effect factor (EF). Seventeen freshwater sediment CFs of nano-CuO are proposed as recommended values for subcontinental regions. The region most likely to be affected by nano-CuO is northern Australia (CF of 21.01·10^3 CTUe, comparative toxic units) and the least likely is northern Europe and northern Canada (CF of 8.55·10^3 CTUe). These sediment CFs for nano-CuO could be used in the future when evaluating the ecosystem impacts of products containing nano-CuO by LCA method.","['sde', 'spi']"
Decision Support Methodology for Designing Sustainable Recycling Process Based on ETV Standards,"The scarcity of resources and the increasing in generation of wastes encourages the need for solutions through circular economy strategy. Recycling is mostly used as the key vector to reduce the environmental impact. Nevertheless, different end-of-life pathways are available even for same kind of waste. All recycling solutions are not equivalent in terms of secondary raw materials quality and quantity. These performance factors of recycled materials are mainly influenced by technological and economic investments, and their changes lead to huge environmental impact differences. Environmental assessment of different aluminium recycling pathways allowed us to identify the lack of decision-making process during the design phase of new recycling pathways. Using the Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) certification guidelines, our methodology allows to assess and guide the choices of designers to ensure economic, environmental and social efficiency.","['sde', 'spi']"
Effect of substrate bias voltage on the microstructure and tribological properties of CrN coatings,"Microstructure, wear and friction coefficient of cr-based magnetron sputtered layers. CrN films were deposited on stainless steel and silicon substrates via magnetron reactive sputtering under a systematic variation of the substrate bias voltage. The influence of the substrate bias voltage on the structural and tribological properties of the films was investigated. The results indicated that increasing the negative bias voltage have many influence on the characteristic of the coatings: concerning their microstructure, we observed that the grain size increased, while their coefficient of friction is influenced by the bias voltage like the wear rate.","['spi', 'phys']"
Age related efficiency of the Leishmanin skin test as a marker of immunity to human visceral leishmaniasisEfficacité selon l’âge du test cutané à la leishmanine comme marqueur d’immunité dans la leishmaniose viscérale humaine.,"This study aimed at investigating whether the efficiency of the leishmanin skin test (LST) to evaluate the immune status of individuals exposed to Leishmania (L.) infantum is age-related. It was conducted in two districts of the governorate of Kairouan, an endemic region for L. infantum infection in Tunisia. Healthy individuals (n = 119) were selected according to two criteria: no current or past history of visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis, and their age range: 1-6 years (group I), 7-14 years (group II), and 20-66 years old (group III). Assessments comprised LSTs, in vitro lymphoproliferative response, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) productions induced by soluble leishmanial antigens (SLA). LST recorded an overall of 89.07% and 89.9% concordance with T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production induced by SLA, respectively. Using in vitro tests as gold standards, LST was found more sensitive for screening individuals from group I (96% and 100%, considering T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production results, respectively), than group II (91% and 97%) and group III (70% and 74%,). Conversely, LST was less specific in group I (84% and 77%) than group II (100% and 94%) and group III (100% for both in vitro tests). Our results suggested that the strength of LST resided in its higher sensitivity, to unravel asymptomatic injections and cell mediated immunity to L. infantum parasite in infants and its higher specificity for screening adult individuals. Negative LST in adults and positive LST in children < 5 years, the population at risk of developing visceral leishmaniasis, remain the weaknesses of LST and should be interpreted with caution.Le but de cette étude a été de voir si l'efficacité du test cutané à la leishmanine (TCL) à évaluer l'im-munité des individus exposés à Leishmania (L.) infantum dépend de l'âge du sujet testé. Nous avons conduit notre étude dans deux délégations du gou-vernorat de Kairouan, région endémique pour la transmission de L. infantum. Des individus sains (n=119) ont été sélectionnés selon les critères d'ab-sence d'antécédents de leishmaniose viscérale (LV) ou cutanée (LC) ainsi que leurs âges:1 à 6 ans (Groupe I); 7 à 14 ans (Groupe II); et 20 à 66 ans (Groupe III). Les évaluations ont compris le TCL, les réponses lymphoprolifératives et la synthèse de l'in-terféron-gamma (IFN-γ) induits in vitro par les antigènes leishmaniens solubles. Les résultats du TCL ont concordé globalement à 89.07% et 89.9% avec ceux des proliférations cellulaires T et de pro-duction d'IFN-γ, respectivement. Considérant les tests in vitro comme «gold standards», le TCL s'est avéré plus sensible pour examiner les individus du groupe I (96% et 100% de concordance avec les proliférations cellulaires T et la production d'IFN-γ, respectivement), que ceux du groupe II (91% et 97%), et ceux du groupe III (70% et 74%). Inversement, il s'est avéré moins spécifique pour l'évaluation du groupe I (84% et 77%), que du groupe II (100% et 94%) et que du groupe III (100% pour les deux tests in vitro).Ces résultats indiquent que la puissance du TCL réside, grâce à une sensibilité élevée, dans sa capacité à identifier une infection asymptomatique et l'acquisition d'une immunité à médiation cellulaire chez l'enfant, et une plus haute spécificité à examiner une population adulte. Un TCL négatif chez l’adulte ou positif dans la population à risque de développer une VL, enfants de moins de 5 ans, constituent les points faibles de ce test et devraient être pris avec précaution.",['sdv']
Grains Size Effect on Charge Trapping in Electron Irradiated Ceramics; Stability and Discharge Study Using a Special Arrangement in a Scanning Electron Microscope,"Dielectric breakdown of ceramics is obviously an important failure in the levels of equipment requiring some insulation safety or to ensure their proper functioning. The manifested microscopic damage processes under electrical stress are indisputably related to charge trapping and detrapping and thus related to energy localization on defects. This work enabled the development of a technique (Influence Current Method) using a specific arrangement in a Scanning Electron Microscope chamber, allowing to measure separately and simultaneously the influence and conduction currents. This permits subsequently tracing back to the trapped charge dynamic during and after electron irradiation. The purpose of this paper is to study firstly the stability of trapped charge in ZrO2/Y2O3 ceramic and secondly to investigate the grains size effect on charging and discharging processes. Via this results the microstructure - dielectric strength correlations are well justified. Instability of trapped charge was found; the majority was evacuated from the irradiated volume. This entrusts to it a conductive insulator character. It has been found that more the grains size decreases more the amount of stabilized trapped charge decreases. This is due to the eventual increase in the grains boundary density in which the oxygen vacancies are concentrated. Note that the increase of grains size improves the dielectric strength.",['spi']
Correlation between microstructure and intergranular corrosion behavior of low delta-ferrite content AISI 316L aged in the range 550-700 C,"The microstructure and the phase identification of austenitic stainless steel AISI 316L with low δ-ferrite content (δ ≤ 1%) and aged for up to 80 000 h at temperatures ranging from 550 to 700 °C were investigated by using an optical microscope (OM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Local changes of chromium content, resulting from nucleation and growth of chromium-rich phases during aging, were quantitatively assessed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The intergranular corrosion behavior (IGC) of annealed and aged specimens was evaluated using the double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) and completed by IGC morphologies according to the ASTM A262 practice A standard. The results showed that δ-ferrite decomposed gradually into M23C6 at 550 °C and decomposed totally into intermetallic phases (σ, η, χ, and R) and into secondary austenite (γr) at temperatures equal to or higher than 650 °C. Similarly γ-austenite decomposed into M23C6 carbide at 550 °C and into intermetallic phases such as η and σ in addition to carbide, at higher temperatures. The time-temperature-sensitization diagram (TTS) was established and used to calculate the critical cooling rate (CCR) that prevents IGC sensitization. The analysis of IGC results leads to the conclusion that sensitization-desensitization is still controlled by the characteristics of chromium-depleted area surrounding austenite grain boundary regions. No significant effect of remained δ-ferrite and derived components on the corrosion behavior of AISI 316 L containing 1% of δ-ferrite.",['spi']

Introducing Taylor Series and Local Approximations using a Historical and Semiotic Approach,"In this article we present the results of a qualitative investigation into the teaching and learning of Taylor series and local approximations. In order to perform a comparative analysis, two investigations are conducted: the first is historical and epistemological, concerned with the pedagogical evolution of semantics, syntax and semiotics; the second is a contemporary institutional investigation, devoted to the results of a review of curricula, textbooks and course handouts in Tunisia and the United States. Our results show that contemporary curricula emphasize the algebraic and analytic approaches to the theory but omit the graphical and numerical registers, which both played a large role in the historical development. We contend that by presenting a more historically accurate didactic approach, student learning can be enriched to give a deeper and more conceptually accurate understanding of the topic.","['math', 'shs']"
SCORM specifications for an emerging world: The linguistic diversity at work,"The world wide spreading of e Learning models, techniques and solutions is imposing new challenges to emerging countries in order to face the digital divide by subscribing to this inevitable global educational process. Many projects, collaborations and initiatives are striving to find out the appropriate solutions to reduce and bridge the e gaps in education through standards definition and implementation. Among the major initiatives that the Agency of French speaking Universities (AUF) has undertaken in this respect, is the assistance forwarded to its French speaking partners to produce standardized educational resources on basis of their own linguistic and cultural specifications.

Massively Distributed Environments and Closed Itemset Mining: The DCIM Approach,"Data analytics in general, and data mining primitives in particular , are a major source of bottlenecks in the operation of information systems. This is mainly due to their high complexity and intensive call to IO operations, particularly in massively distributed environments. Moreover , an important application of data analytics is to discover key insights from the running traces of information system in order to improve their engineering. Mining closed frequent itemsets (CFI) is one of these data mining techniques, associated with great challenges. It allows discovering itemsets with better efficiency and result compactness. However, discovering such itemsets in massively distributed data poses a number of issues that are not addressed by traditional methods. One solution for dealing with such characteristics is to take advantage of parallel frameworks like, e.g., MapReduce. We address the problem of distributed CFI mining by introducing a new parallel algorithm, called DCIM, which uses a prime number based approach. A key feature of DCIM is the deep combination of data mining properties with the principles of massive data distribution. We carried out exhaustive experiments over real world datasets to illustrate the efficiency of DCIM for large real world datasets with up to 53 million documents.",['info']
Text-Edge-Box: An Object Proposal Approach for Scene Text Localization,"Text proposal has been gaining interest in recent years due to the great success of object proposal in categories-independent object localization. In this paper, we present a novel text-specific proposal technique that provides superior bounding boxes for accurate text localization in scenes. The proposed technique, which we call Text Edge Box (TEB), uses a binary edge map, a gradient map and an orientation map of an image as inputs. Connected components are first found within the binary edge map, which are scored by two proposed low-cue text features that are extracted in the gradient map and the orientation map, respectively. These scores present text probability of connected components and are aggregated in a text edge image. Scene texts proposals are finally generated by grouping the connected components and estimating their likelihood of being words. The proposed TEB has been evaluated on the two public scene text datasets: the Robust Reading Competition 2013 dataset (ICDAR 2013) dataset and the Street View Text (SVT) dataset. Experiments show that the proposed TEB outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques greatly.",['info']
On necessary precautions when measuring solid polymer linear viscoelasticity with dynamic analysis in torsion,"Solid polymer linear viscoelasticity in shear is often characterized by applying torsion and using the Saint-Venant solution when rectangular prismatic specimens are considered. It is shown that experimental dynamic torsion tests can show a dependency of the storage modulus and damping factor on the dimensions of the rectangular prismatic specimen when linear temperature ramps are applied. While the discrepancy of damping factor is explained by temperature heterogeneities and can be corrected easily by applying temperature steps, the inconsistency of storage modulus is due to an invalid application of the Saint-Venant solution. Finite element simulations allowed definition of the sample dimensions for which the Saint-Venant solution provides a good approximation, and a coefficient is given to correct the results obtained with commercial instruments when other sample dimensions are used.",['spi']
Multiaxial experiments with radial loading paths on a polymeric foam,"Cellular materials such as polymeric foams in particular have been widely studied under uniaxial loading conditions.

Using a post-processing method of analysis which can be used to study elementary mechanical behavior, the authors show the occurrence of non-proportional stress paths in the material under investigation although proportional kinematic paths were imposed.

Origin of epoxies embrittlement during oxidative ageing,"Thermal oxidation of three epoxy resins prepared from flexible or rigid prepolymers and hardeners was studied by monitoring epoxy mechanical and physical changes. The physical changes were followed by mass measurements, glass transition temperature using DSC and sub-glass β transition using DMA. It was put in evidence that embrittlement is not directly associated to Tg or mass loss changes since epoxy network based on isophorone diamine (IPDA) hardeners were shown to undergo mainly a chain scission at the beginning of exposure process whereas epoxy network based on trioxatridecane diamine (TTDA) hardeners exhibits a crosslinking process with a significant mass loss. The only common feature for both epoxy systems to understand embrittlement is the drop of amplitude of β transition with oxidation.","['chim', 'spi']"

A scientific network serving the uses of 3D humanities,"The 3D Consortium of the TGIR Huma-Num has been created based on the observation that there are many initiatives around 3D for the Digital Humanities without real coordination between them.

The difficulty is increased by the fact that we are dealing with multiple domains, combining science and technology with the humanities. The aim of the consortium is to facilitate discussions by putting together a maximum of research groups that integrate the use of 3D digital data in their scientific practices, to develops tools for acquisition, visualization, interpretation and preservation of data for the Humanities. The consortium is therefore willing to develop synergies between national Humanities and 3D disciplines in order to: share experiences; edit recommendations in terms of methodology, standards and formats; identify the specific needs of Digital Humanities and link them to the rapid evolution of 3D technologies; develop common tools and platforms; bring French experiences into international works (Parthenos, Dariah, ARIADNE); (vii) disseminate all this information as widely as possible, among academics, industry and administrations.","['info', 'shs']"
"Photoredox catalysis using a new iridium complex as an efficient toolbox for radical, cationic and controlled polymerizations under soft blue to green lights","A new iridium complex (nIr) was designed and investigated as a photoinitiator catalyst for radical and cationic polymerizations upon very soft irradiations (lights ranging from 457 to 532 nm). A ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of an epoxy monomer was easily promoted through the interaction between nIr and an iodonium salt (Iod) upon light. The addition of N-vinylcarbazole (NVK) enhances the performance. In radical polymerization, nIr can be efficient in combination with phenacyl bromide (PBr) and optionally an amine: these photoinitiating systems work according to an original oxidative cycle and a regeneration of nIr is observed. A control of the methyl methacrylate polymerization (conducted under a 462 nm light) with 1.2–1.6 polydispersity indexes was displayed. Surface modifications by direct laser write was also easily carried out for the first time through surface re-initiation experiments, i.e. the dormant species being reactivated by light in the presence of nIr; the polymer surfaces were analyzed by XPS. The chemical mechanisms were examined through laser flash photolysis, NMR, ESR and size exclusion chromatography experiments",['chim']

Wind tunnel investigation of dynamic trimming on upwind sail aerodynamics,"An experiment was performed in the Yacht Research Unit’s Twisted Flow Wind Tunnel (University of Auckland) to test the effect of dynamic trimming on three IMOCA 60 inspired mainsail models in an upwind ( AW = 60°) unheeled configuration. This study presents dynamic fluid structure interaction results in well controlled conditions (wind, sheet length) with a dynamic trimming system. Trimming oscillations are done around an optimum value of CFobj previously found with a static trim. Different oscillation amplitudes and frequencies of trimming are investigated. Measurements are done with a 6 component force balance and a load sensor giving access to the unsteady mainsail sheet load. The driving CFx and optimization target CFobj coefficient first decrease at low reduced frequency fr for quasi-steady state then increase, becoming higher than the static state situation. The driving force CFx and the optimization target coefficient CFobj show an optimum for the three different design sail shapes located at fr = 0.255. This optimum is linked to the power transmitted to the rig and sail system by the trimming device. The effect of the camber of the design shape is also investigated. The flat mainsail design benefits more than the other mainsail designs from the dynamic trimming compared to their respective static situtation. This study presents dynamic results that cannot be accurately predicted with a quasi-static approach. These results are therefore valuable for future FSI numerical tools validations in unsteady conditions.",['spi']
Modal Analysis of Pressures on a Full-Scale Spinnaker,"While sailing offwind, the trimmer typically adjusts the downwind sail “on the verge of luffing”, occasionally letting the luff of the sail flap. Due to the unsteadiness of the spinnaker itself, maintaining the luff on the verge of luffing requires continual adjustments. The propulsive force generated by the offwind sail depends on this trimming and is highly fluctuating. During a flapping sequence, the aerodynamic load can fluctuate by 50% of the average load. On a J/80 class yacht, we simultaneously measured time-resolved pressures on the spinnaker, aerodynamic loads, boat data and wind data. Significant spatio-temporal patterns were detected in the pressure distribution. In this paper we present averages and main fluctuations of pressure distributions and of load coefficients for different apparent wind angles as well as a refined analysis of pressure fluctuations, using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method. POD shows that pressure fluctuations due to luffing of the spinnaker can be well represented by only one proper mode related to a unique spatial pressure pattern and a dynamic behavior evolving with the Apparent Wind Angles. The time evolution of this proper mode is highly correlated with load fluctuations. Moreover, POD can be employed to filter the measured pressures more efficiently than basic filters. The reconstruction using the first few modes makes it possible to restrict the flapping analysis to the most energetic part of the signal and remove insignificant variations and noises. This might be helpful for comparison with other measurements and numerical simulations.",['spi']
THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN UKRAINE IN 2014–2019: MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS,"The article provides an analysis of the current state of the procedural legislation of Ukraine in the context of the judicial system reform carried out in 2014-2019. The drastic changes in this direction, which began with the tragic events in the life of Ukraine in 2014, radically reversed the three components of national justice – judicial system, status of judges and legal procedure. The key issue of the judicial reform in Ukraine is the implementation of the principles of the organization and administration of justice, the main of which is the supremacy of the law. The essential principle in terms of the strategic vision of the key results of the judicial reform in Ukraine was the improvement of such principles as political and economic independence of justice. In accordance with constitutional amendments, a reauthorization took place between the High Qualification Commission of Judges of Ukraine and the new constitutional body – the High Council of Justice. The power to review disciplinary cases against all judges, taking decisions on temporary suspension of judges from the justice fall within the competence of the latter. The Higher Qualification Commission of Judges of Ukraine is solely responsible for selection of judges, qualification assessments, holding competitions to fill the vacancy for judges. The second principle of the organization and implementation of the judicial power in Ukraine was the principle of accessibility of justice, which is traditionally viewed as a lack of excessive judicial expenses, lack of judicial corruption, complex judicial procedures and excessive length of the judicial process.

Application of membrane processes in food and dairy industry,"Membrane processes have become major tools in food processing for more than 25 years. The food industry represents a significant part of the turnover of the membrane manufacturing industry worldwide. The main applications of membrane operations are in the dairy industry (whey protein concentration, milk protein standardization, etc.) far before beverages (wine, beer, fruit juices, etc.) and egg products. Among the very numerous applications on an industrial scale a few striking particular separations which represent the last advances in food processing are reported. Clarification of fruit, vegetable and sugar juices by microfiltration or ultrafiltration allows the flow sheets to be simplified or the processes made cleaner and the final product quality improved. Enzymatic hydrolysis combined to selective ultrafiltration can produce beverages from vegetable proteins. In the beer industry, recovery of maturation and fermentation tank bottoms is already applied at industrial scale. During the last decade significant progress has been performed with microfiltration membrane in rough beer clarification which is the most important challenge of this technology. In the wine industry the cascade cross-flow microfiltration (0.2 ~m pore diameter) - electrodialysis allows limpidity, microbiological and tartaric stability to be ensured. In the milk and dairy industry, recent developments of cross-flow microfiltration (1.4 p.m) for the production of drinking milk and cheese milk are reported. Cross-flow microfiltration (0.1 ~m) makes it possible to achieve the separation of skim milk micellar casein and soluble proteins. Both streams are given high added value in cheese making (retentate) and through fractionation and isolation of soluble proteins (13-1actoglobuline; cx-lactalbumine) (permeate). At last, a large field of applications is emerging for the treatment of individual process streams at source for water and technical fluids re-use and end of pipe treatment of combined effluent streams, while reducing sludge production and improving the final purified water quality.",['sdv']

"fast, powerful and efficient femtocryble","What are 'New Yb-doped crystals and laser architectures for the development of a chain femtosecond laser high power' (FEMTOCRYBLE)'s three major research objectives? The main objective of FEMTOCRYBLE is to use newly developed Ytterbium (Yb)-doped lasers to improve the performance of diode-pumped femtosecond solid-state lasers in terms of power, pulse duration, energy and efficiency. For this, the first research objective concerns crystal improvement; a second concerns the study of the spectral and thermal properties of the crystals in laser condition; and a third concerns the development of innovative laser architectures and geometries. How is the project structured? FEMTOCRYBLE is a straightforward, vertical project. We proceed with growing the crystals, undertaking the laser experiment and then transferring the technology to a company. The strength of the project is based on strong collaboration between partners. Improvements in laser quality influence laser performance, which helps us to understand problems that might be encountered in future crystal generation. France is at the forefront of innovation and research in this field; why is this? There is particularly strong international competition in this field. Nonetheless, French laboratories have been positioned as one of the world leaders on crystal and laser developments for ultrashort-pulse generation based on new Ytterbium (Yb)-doped crystals. This leadership is due to a strong collaboration between French laboratories expert in material science, such as CIMAP and LCMCP, and those (such as LCF) which specialises in diode-pumped femtosecond laser devices. This national focus and leadership has already led to several important breakthroughs using very innovative Yb-doped crystals. In 2006 we developed Yb:CALGO, the shortest pulse ever obtained with an Yb-doped crystal, and undertook the first demonstration of laser operation and femtosecond pulse generation of another very promising crystal, Yb:CaF 2. Has a multidisciplinary approach proved important to FEMTOCRYBLE?",['phys']
An alternative procedure for extraction of DNA from ancient and weathered bone fragments,"Bone is the most challenging tissue for DNA extraction and purification. Expensive commercial kits and specific equipments are often used in forensic and anthropology laboratories towards that goal. We present here an integrated procedure that gives satisfactory results for DNA preparation from fresh, ancient or weathered bones. Extraction is performed under simple but efficient vacuum-controlled conditions that greatly limit the risks of cross-contaminations. The whole process has been designed to minimize the need for expensive equipment and chemicals, and to be compatible with any molecular biology laboratory. In addition, no toxic reagents are necessary and the procedure is straightforward. Combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), this method allows species identification and sex determination from subcellular amount of DNA (1-5 pg). In addition, enough DNA is generally obtained for human DNA profiling if necessary. The whole procedure from bone treatment to the final qPCR results takes less than 48 hours. This procedure should allow any laboratory with standard molecular biology equipment and expertise to perform bone DNA characterization whenever necessary.",['shs']

Optimization of Block Copolymer Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries,"Safety is one of the most important criteria for electrochemical energy storage devices used in large scale applications such as wind or solar farms. In this context, solid polymer electrolytes based on nanostructured block copolymer electrolytes (BCEs) are promising because their properties can be finely tuned by adjusting simultaneously their block chemistries and polymer architectures. However, there is a need to rationalize the different properties of BCE that are optimal for battery applications. We produced by controlled radical polymerization a large number of BCEs based on either (1) linear poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or (2) comb PEO as the ionic conductor block, and polystyrene as the structural block. We varied the molecular weight of the PEO-based block, the composition, and the architecture (diblock vs triblock). We performed a systematic analysis of their thermodynamic, ionic transport, and mechanical properties. To verify the potential of BCEs as electrolytes, we evaluated their electrochemical stabilities. Laboratory scale batteries comprising the best BCEs and LiFePO4 as a positive active material were cycled at different rates and temperatures. This process allows the selection of the best architectures and compositions that had been successfully tested in battery prototypes and cycled for more than 600 cycles at high rates without any dendritic growth.",['chim']
Writing a Reproducible Article,"Nous avons récemment soumis à Europar notre premier article dont l'analyse est reproductible de bout en bout.

Sensor-Based Estimation of Human Motion for Control Synchronization,"This paper addresses the question of embedded human motion sensing, in the framework of interaction with an artificial controller, either for activating a robot or for stimulating impaired human links. After a short presentation of the sensing problem and of the related measurement technologies, we describe the two main applications we have considered. The first one is the early detection of the paraplegic's intention in a Sit-to-Stand Transfer problem; here the actuation consists of the electro-stimulation of the knee extensors of the patient. The second is the estimation in real time of a variable allowing to synchronize the motion on a robot leg or of the impaired leg of a stroke patient on a human stationary walking gait.

Decommissioning as a Step Forward for Risk Governance,"Decommissioning represents a new problem for risk governance as it implies two contradictory strategies. First, the disassembly, transport and destruction of contaminated machines and buildings imply foreseeable risks. For them, we use anticipation strategy (Wildavsky, 1985). But at the same time facilities are not in fully determinate states: unexpected events are to be expected (IAEA, 2016). For these events, we need resilience strategy (Wildavsky, 1985). However, literature cannot currently tell how risk governance can articulate anticipation and resilience. To do so, I study the case of the ""technical dialog"" (proposed as an ideal type of anticipation) contributing to the nuclear risk governance in France. I study heavy handling activities, which are very common in decommissioning operations (proposed as an ideal type of resilience). I then compare these two fields to find out how anticipation and resilience are articulated. The results show that anticipation and resilience can be articulated by risk governance when it extands the demonstration or the assessment, and when it arranges imprecisions in these documents. Such actions produce a convergence of doubts initiating inquiries in risk governance and high-risk operations.",['shs']
Acoustic characterization of hydraulic systems: application to POGO phenomenon,"This paper presents an experimental methodology for the evaluation of dynamic transfer matrices using three pressure sensors. The experimental study was carried out at the CREMHyG’s acoustic test rig. The speed of sound in the pipe, as well as discharge fluctuations were evaluated from the pressure fluctuations measured during tests carried out under excitation of a modulator (piston). The method applied to reconstitute flow rate fluctuations from pressure sensors were validated by comparisons with piston displacement measurements. The transfer matrices for straight pipes and POGO corrective devices were identified based on electrical analogy. The identification method was validated by comparing the transfer matrix components to theoretical values. The results can be applied in the future, in the case of space rocket.",['spi']

Recycling chains : a proposal for an exhaustive definition,"In the context of a circular economy, recycling presents as an interesting solution to reduce the impact of raw materials extraction and to reduce the quantity of waste that is incinerated or landfilled. However nowadays, there is no global and complete definition (which could be used as a common reference) of recycling chains. Listing the parameters to be taken into account, such a definition would allow manufacturers and researchers to better assess the efficiency and the stability of supply chains (not only at the beginning of the product lifecycle, but also towards the next one), and to accurately compare them. Therefore, we need a better definition of recycling chains, describing the system in its whole dimension (i.e. all internal and external factors) so as to improve (i) our understanding of the system and (ii) its inherent problems. Firstly, the recycling chain will be defined and described as exhaustively as possible. Then, the second part will focus on the best way to integrate this information when analyzing and optimizing recycling chains. Lastly, perspectives of this preliminary work will be detailed.","['sde', 'spi']"
Safety evaluation of the food enzyme beta‐amylase obtained from barley (Hordeum vulgare),"The food enzyme considered in this opinion is a 4-α-D-glucan maltohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.2) obtained from grain of barley (Hordeum vulgare), by the companies Genencor International B.V. and Senson Oy. This The food enzyme considered in this opinion is a 4-α-D-glucan maltohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.2) obtained from grain of barley (Hordeum vulgare), by the companies Genencor International B.V. and Senson Oy. This β-amylase is intended to be used in several food-manufacturing processes: baking and brewing processes, distilled alcohol production, and starch processing for the production of glucose syrups. The compositional data provided for the food enzyme were considered sufficient. The manufacturing process did not raise safety concerns. Based on the maximum use levels recommended for the respective food processes, dietary exposure to the food enzyme–total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of individual data from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. This exposure estimate is similar to or lower than the exposure to a fraction of barley comparable to the food enzyme– TOS, resulting from the consumption of barley-derived foods. As the food enzyme is derived from edible parts of barley, in line with the requirements of the guidance document on food enzyme assessment, the Panel accepted that there was no need for the provision of toxicological data for this food enzyme. Barley is known as a gluten-containing cereal; however, the gluten content in the food enzyme was found to be below the detection limit of the applied analytical method and well below the threshold value of 20 mg/kg for ‘gluten-free’ products. Furthermore, the potential allergenicity was evaluated by searching for similarity between the amino acid sequence of β-amylase and the sequences of known food allergens; no match was found. Based on the origin of the food enzyme from edible parts of barley, the enzymemanufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided, the allergenicity and dietary exposure assessment, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use.",['sdv']

"The Nitrates Directive, incompatible with livestock farming? The case of France and Northern European countries","Comparing France’s manure policies to those of the northern European countries brings to light significant differences in mindsets. Policies in the north of Europe, which have gradually been aligned with Denmark’s policy, have focused action on effective compliance with fertilisation balance, without attempting to block or avoid necessary structural changes. By contrast, France based its manure policy on controlling and supporting its livestock farming structures, without allocating sufficient means to control mineral surpluses. The policies enacted in the northern European countries are more in line with economic analysis recommendations than France’s policy. Based on this observation, we put forward several recommendations that could improve the ecological and economic efficiency of French policy: - Effectively apply regulations, by defining the right ecological standards and sanctions. - Expand sensitive zones, where stricter measures would be applied according to ecological issues. - Simplify regulations, by eliminating measures that unnecessarily limit farm restructuring. - Facilitate manure transfers, to help minimise manure disposal costs. - Compensate income losses temporarily but without creating distortions.",['shs']
Evaluation du pilotage de la performance extra financière des organisations: Cas de la Responsabilité sociale et environnementale des entreprises françaises du CAC40,"Extra financial performance of organizations depends on the degree of incentive intensity of the institutional framework and the degree of voluntarism leaders in the selection and application of non-financial reporting standards. French companies traded, benefiting from an institutional incentive-intensive, which pushes agents to appropriate more or less a repository of reporting the social and environmental responsibility, do not improve their performance extra financial when the degree of political will of leaders decreases. The principle of voluntarism non-financial reporting is operating in an institutional incentive-intensive and low degree of voluntarism. Hence the relativity of Tetranormalization.La performance extra financière des organisations est fonction du degré d'intensité d'incitation du cadre institutionnel et du degré du volontarisme des dirigeants dans le choix et l'application des normes du reporting extra financier.

"If the objective is herd immunity, on whom should it be built?","Assuming that there is no other solution than herd immunity in front of the current pandemic, on which categories of citizens should we build this herd immunity? Given the fact that young people face a mortality rate which is at least a thousand times smaller than people aged 70 years and more, there is a simple rational to build it on these younger generations. The transfer of some mortality risk to younger people raises difficult ethical issues. However, none of the familiar moral or operational guidelines (equality of rights, VSL, QALY, ...) that have been used in the Western world over the last century weights the value of young lives 1000 times or more than the lives of the elders. This suggests that Society could offer covid protection to the elders by confining them as long as this herd immunity has not been attained by the younger generations. This would be a potent demonstration of intergenerational solidarity towards the most vulnerable people in our community. The welfare gain of this age-specific deconfinement strategy is huge, as it can reduce the global death toll by more than 80%.",['shs']

Is environmentalism a remedy for the crisis of democracy ?,"Low turnout at the polls and public meetings, political dormancy between electoral campaigns, unapologetic careerism within the parties, campaign gimmicks – the list of obstacles to genuine democratic debate keeps growing. As the 2017 presidential election is approaching, that of 2002 still lurks in the memory. Jacques Chirac’s election after Lionel Jospin’s defeat in the first round administered a democratic and social jolt, which, nevertheless, did not bring about any change in the mainstream parties or any evolution in institutional practices. And, while the National Front has not (yet?) come to be considered as just another party, it nonetheless structures a large part of public debate over several issues – immigration, Islam, security, the rejection of Europe and globalization, and the denunciation of political scandals. If the campaign slogan “Anything but the National Front” comes to pervade the upcoming presidential and legislative electoral campaigns, that will mean that the political vision involving debate over real platforms has failed deeply and lastingly. In this context, one may wonder how “democracy can be made more democratic,” to use Sandra Laugier’s and Albert Ogien’s words (1), and whether commonly rec- ognized obstacles to democratic debate would be overcome if an environmental platform was adopted as the foundation of a new social contract.",['shs']
Science Curiosity as a Correlate of Academic Performance in Mathematics Education: Insights from Nigerian Higher Education,"This study investigated the relationship between the science curiosity levels of undergraduate of mathematics education in a Nigerian higher educational institution and their academic grade point averages.

The Science Curiosity Scale – Comparative Self Report was adapted to measure the students' distinctive appetite for consuming science-related media for personal edification. The correlational analysis of science curiosity scores and the students CGPA indicated a weak negative relationship (r =-0.049, p = 0.621), suggesting an interplay of other important factors in the relationship between academic performance and science curiosity. Based on the findings of this study, it was recommended that key stakeholders of mathematics education consider curiosity as a complex ability related to several functions of the mind and that it enhances systematic commitment on the part of the learner, providing enormous foundational benefits that could be reaped in the process of educating students.","['scco', 'shs']"
Adversarial vs defensive artificial intelligence in cyber-security: a mutually beneficial tournament?Intelligence artificielle adversaire vs défensive en cyber-sécurité : un tournoi mutuellement profitable ?,"L’intelligence artificielle comprend une diversité de sous-domaines au nombre desquels figure l’UEBA (User and Entity Behaviour Analytics). Ce dernier, en plein essor, repose sur l’analyse automatique des comportements humains et non humains. Plus spécifiquement, dans le domaine de la cyber-sécurité, un procédé UEBA consiste à détecter des actions hostiles en se basant sur la nature inhabituelle des événements observés sur un système d'information. Les systèmes défensifs de type UEBA existant à ce jour souffrent de certaines limitations que nous cherchons à contourner. À cette fin, nous avons conçu un système de type UEBA associant, d’une part, des réseaux de neurones profonds auto-encodeurs permettant la détection d'anomalies comportementales individuelles, avec d’autre part, un procédé permettant de corréler une pluralité d’événements organisés en graphes afin de détecter les scénarios hostiles constituant une attaque notamment de type APT (Advanced Persistent Threat). Déjà, notre système réduit le taux de faux positifs et négatifs, il produit des alertes fortement explicables et possède une capacité de mise à l’échelle horizontale. Cependant, nous n'avons pas encore adressé la problématique dite de la « dérive conceptuelle », laquelle se manifeste par une obsolescence progressive du modèle appris des comportements, inhérente à l'évolution temporelle naturelle des comportements du système observé. Pour contourner cette dérive, il est nécessaire d’entrainer en continu un système de détection basé sur les anomalies, ce qui ouvre la porte à un adversaire susceptible de mener une attaque dite de la « grenouille ébouillantée », laquelle consiste pour l’attaquant à distiller progressivement les traces d’une attaque afin que ces dernières demeures inaperçues et soient in fine intégrées au modèle des comportements normaux, rendant ainsi l’attaque indétectable. Nous présentons ici un aperçu de notre solution capable d’affaiblir efficacement une telle attaque en améliorant le processus de détection et en tirant parti de l'expertise humaine. Nous présentons également des travaux préliminaires sur une intelligence artificielle adversaire menant une attaque par leurrage, qui sera utilisée pour aider à évaluer et à améliorer le système de défense. Ces systèmes défensif et offensif mettent en œuvre un apprentissage joint, continu et actif, dans une étape qui est nécessaire à l'évaluation, à la validation et à la certification des solutions défensives basées sur l'intelligence artificielle de type UEBA ou autre.","['info', 'math']"

Methodologies and approaches of instructional delivery in tertiary institutions have raised the need for technological augmentation for both students and mathematics educators. Cloud computing yield itself to this quest by strengthening individualized learning via unrestricted access to infrastructure, platforms, content, and powerful web-based tools from anywhere within the private cloud architecture adopted by tertiary institutions in Nigeria. This paper considers broad safety concerns of this technological intervention and the prospects of improving mathematics education in tertiary institutions in Nigeria.",['shs']
Internet Skills as a Measure of Digital Inclusion among Mathematics Education Students: Implications for Sustainable Human Capital Development in Nigeria,"Global technology penetration reports have consistently indicated high levels of digital technology adoption among Nigerian students. Considering that mathematics education students are being trained to manifest proficiency in vital areas of communication, information technology, critical thinking, leadership, teamwork, problem solving and entrepreneurship, the imperative of emphasizing the place of digital skills in their education is more relevant now than ever. Consequently, this study adopts a survey research design to provide detailed background information of component indicators of digital literacy among a sample of 215 Mathematics Education students drawn randomly from a Federal University in North Central, Nigeria. The Digital Access Index (DAI) and the Measure of Internet Skills (MOIS) were used as standardized measures of digital inclusion, with data analyzed using mean, standard deviation and simple charts. The findings of the study indicate that the status of digital inclusion among mathematics education students in Nigeria is high. The implications of this outcome for sustainable human capital development were discussed. Evidently, the level of internet skills revealed in this study is an indication that despite existing context in Nigeria, youths will continue to negotiate and chart their way to political participation and economic success.","['info', 'shs']"

Le système d'information géographique au coeur de l'exploitation des données spatiales en archéologie préventive – L'exemple des opérations archéologiques du canal Seine‑Nord Europe,"Mots‑clés Système d'Information Géographique (SIG), archéologie préventive, Institut national de recherches archéologiques préventives (Inrap), canal Seine-Nord Europe, modèle conceptuel, plateau technique, topographe, diagnostic archéologique, fouille archéologique, fouille paléolithique, vestige de la Grande Guerre Logiciels ESRI™ utilisés ArcMap™, ArcCatalog™, Spatial Analyst™, 3D Analyst™, Geostatistical Analyst™ Résumé Depuis 2008, l'Institut national de recherches en archéologie préventive (Inrap) premier acteur de l'archéologie en France, mène les opérations d'explorations archéologiques en préalable à la construction du canal Seine-Nord Europe. Ce sont ainsi près de 2 500 ha qui, à terme, seront parcourus par les chercheurs de l'institut. L'ampleur de l'aire d'investigation archéologique prévue pour le projet d'aménagement du canal Seine-Nord Europe induit une accumulation très importante de données scientiiques. Ain d'optimiser l'utilisation de ces données, la décision de mettre en place un système d'information géographique (SIG) est vite apparue comme une évidence. Cette décision était d'autant plus applicable que les opérations archéologiques du futur canal bénéiciaient de la mise en place d'un plateau technique. Il constitue une véritable plate-forme qui relie les archéologues à la production des rapports scientiiques, et permet une harmonisation des méthodes d'acquisition et de l'exploitation des données ainsi qu'un archivage centralisé. Celui-ci intègre des topographes, des infographistes et des personnes fortement sensibilisées à l'utilisation des SIG et des bases de données relationnelles. Cette équipe a, dès le début des opérations, proposé une rélexion sur les processus scientiiques et techniques d'acquisition et d'exploitation des données. La chaîne opératoire ainsi mise en place permet d'optimiser l'intégration des données archéologiques dans le SIG, de valoriser les compétences de chaque acteur du projet et d'assurer une véritable collaboration entre les archéologues et le plateau technique. Celui-ci, répond aux demandes techniques de l'archéologue pour lui permettre une exploitation de ses données en accord avec sa problématique scientiique.

"Can Agriculture be a Territorial Resource in Periurban territories? The case of an inter-municipal structure ""Volvic Sources et Volcans","Les auteurs retracent un parcours de recherche orienté par des interrogations autour de la place de l’agriculture dans les projets des territoires périurbains. A travers l’analyse des stratégies d’aménagement dans une périphérie d’agglomération moyenne en France (la communauté de communes de Volvic Sources et Volcans), les auteurs montrent comment un projet de territoire se construit autour de l’attractivité économique et de la qualité de l’environnement en niant l’agriculture. Le papier argumente la nécessité de considérer l’agriculture comme une ressource territoriale pour les périphéries d’agglomération et le développement d’un agenda de recherche abordant la gouvernance des territoires péri-urbains et les modalités de prise en compte de l’agriculture en tant que levier pour le développement de ces territoires.Gli autori si interessano al ruolo assegnato all’agricoltura nella programmazione e pianificazione territoriale riguardante le aree peri-urbane. Attraverso l’analisi delle strategie di gestione della periferia di un centro urbano di medie dimensioni (l’aggregazione di comuni delle “Sorgenti e Vulcani di Vovic”) gli autori mostrano come la costruzione di un piano territoriale attorno all’attrattività economica e alla qualità ambientale non prenda in considerazione alcuna l’agricoltura.

Envisioning the contribution of extension work to the transition towards sustainability in agriculture and within rural areas.,"The presentation aims to make proposals regarding changes which might be required in AKIS so that they can support farmers in their transitions towards more sustainable agriculture. We make 3 main proposals : first we propose that extensionists need to reflect upon institutional and organizational arrangements which support design-use relations and to identify how they contribute : (i) to support both exploration and implementation of transformative intentions whilesupport, (ii) To open discussion spaces in which this transformation intention is debated ; (iii) to enable new comers to participate actively to the exploration-implementation processes. Second we propose to consider that discussion spaces among extensionists based on work analysis and experience sharing are useful to enable extensionits to develop new enquiries in order to be efficient in a high diversity of front office situations.Third we propose to consider that There is a need to reframe the back office work: (i) less experiments more scientific monitoring ; (ii) less ready-to-apply solutions, more guidelines for exploration.",['shs']
"RETURNING RESPONSIBILITY TO THE HOME: OUTCOMES OF BACKGROUND CHECKS ON LOW AND HIGH ACHIEVERS IN MIDDLE BASIC MATHEMATICS IN NORTH BANK SUBURB OF MAKURDI, NIGERIA","This study is a correlational survey of the impact of home involvement on the mathematics achievement of Basic 5 pupils in North Bank suburb of Makurdi, Benue State, Nigeria. The study is the outcome of the first phase of a local intervention programme targeted at encouraging homes in the suburb to actively support the mathematics education of children at the Basic Education level. The participants of the study comprise 73 Basic 5 pupils along with their parents across three basic schools in the suburb. The mathematics achievement scores of the pupils for the First Term of the 2016/2017 Academic Session were correlated with home involvement scores generated from the adopted Parental Involvement Questionnaire. The correlational analysis established a weak positive relationship (r = 0.0177, p = 0.9241; and r = 0.174, p = 0.2884) between home involvement and mathematics achievement. Further interaction with pupils revealed that outside pupils' parents, certain friends, members of extended family and neighbours play vital roles, ranging from re-teaching class work at home to providing guidance for mathematics homework.",['shs']
Advocating Mathematics Teacher Research Prowess for Improved Professionalism,"While serving in the field of practice, teachers have continued to hold to the view that research is an activity carried out by professional researchers based outside the basic schools. This is because traditionally, class teachers have never been expected to comment on the theory and practice of their work. However, recent push by the Teacher Research movement across the globe has emphasized teacher research as a process in which educators note problems in the context of their own schools and classrooms and propose investigative methods appropriate to address the problems. On this premise, this review first considers the ramification of mathematics teacher research in improving professionalism in the teaching and learning of mathematics. Secondly, teacher professionalism in mathematics education was given a detailed coverage. Thirdly, the task of mathematics teachers as researchers was considered. The role of higher education in nurturing fruitful collaborations with basic schools was discussed along with the implications of mathematics teacher research for classroom practice in Nigeria.",['shs']

Quantitative analysis of real-time systems using priced timed automata,"The problems of time-dependent behavior in general, and dynamic resource allocation in particular, pervade many aspects of modern life. Prominent examples range from reliability and efficient use of communication resources in a telecommunication network to the allocation of tracks in a continental railway network, from scheduling the usage of computational resources on a chip for durations of nanoseconds to the weekly, monthly or longer-range reactive planning in a factory or a supply chain. These problems have been subject to substantial research for decades by different communities such as operational research, computer systems performance evaluation as well as planning and scheduling, witnessed by large ACM communities such as SIGMETRICS and PERFORMANCE. In this paper we argue that the formalism of timed automata together with recent extensions provides an alternative framework with complementary, yet competitive, results in terms of modeling ca-pabilities and efficiency of analysis.",['info']

EPICS: Fair Opportunistic Multi-Content Dissemination,"Achieving efficient content dissemination in mobile opportunistic networks becomes a big challenge when content sizes are large and require more capacity than what contact opportunities between nodes may offer. Content fragmentation solves only part of the problem, as nodes still need to decide which fragment to send when a contact happens. To address this problem, we propose EPICS, a protocol designed to quickly exchange large contents in opportunistic networks. Using grey relational analysis, EPICS is able to balance the distribution of contents that have different sizes and creation times, providing fairer delay distribution and faster dissemination. We implemented and evaluated EPICS through real experimentation using Android devices. Results show that EPICS significantly reduces content dissemination delays when compared to classic approaches.",['info']

Gender and entrepreneurial intentions in a transition economy context: case of the Czech Republic,"This study examines the effect of gender on students’ entrepreneurial intentions in the Czech Republic, a country that exhibits a particular transition economy context with private entrepreneurship being relatively recent. While gender equality is in general legislatively enshrined in Czech society, one can ask whether in reality gender equality displays in the entrepreneurial intentions of students. Our theoretical framework is based on Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behaviour. Based on a survey of 200 students, our results show that gender and level of entrepreneurial intentions are not independent. We examine the phenomenon by considering the beliefs, antecedents of intention, and we find noticeable gender-related differences in their nature. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, we show that entrepreneurial intentions are slightly gendered. Secondly we analyse which determinants of these intentions following the Ajzen´s Theory of Planned Behaviour are concerned and discuss the way to act upon.",['shs']
Architecture adapted to climate in the work of Le Corbusier: the Maison du Brésil in ParisArquitectura adaptada al clima en la obra de Le Corbusier: La Casa de Brasil en París,"La crisis del internacionalismo en arquitectura en los años 30 produjo un giro en la obra de uno de sus máximos exponentes, Le Corbusier.

"Positive effects of alternative cropping systems on terrestrial Oligochaeta (Clitellata, Annelida)","Agricultural intensification has reduced soil biodiversity in cultivated fields. Alternative cropping systems have been implemented to limit the harmful environmental effects of intensive conventional systems. This study aims at (i) assessing the impact of alternative systems on abundance and biomass of earthworms and enchytraeids, which are involved in key agroecological functions, and (ii) investigating the relationship between these soil organisms, under field conditions. Field data were collected in spring 2014 in two long-term agricultural sites near Paris, France. In Site 1, two types of organic amendments i.e. animal manure (MAN) and composted sludge (SLU) were compared to a control system (CONT) without organic fertilization. In Site 2, four different cropping systems were compared: a conventional (CONV), an integrated (INT), an organic (ORG) and a living mulch-based cropping system (LIV). They differed mainly in soil tillage, pesticide and fertilizer use, crop rotation and crop biomass production. In both sites, higher earthworm abundance was found in the alternative systems except in the INT system i.e. SLU, MAN vs CONT and LIV, ORG vs CONV, even if differences were not always significant. For enchytraeids, we found no significant effect of organic amendments but a higher abundance in LIV and ORG systems than in CONV and INT systems in Site 2. Positive effects of alternative systems on earthworm and enchytraeid communities could be explained by the organic amendments in Site 1 and the permanent plant cover, the absence of pesticide use and tillage and the crop rotations in Site 2. Finally, no significant correlation was found between enchytraeid and earthworm abundance or biomass. We concluded that under environmental favorable conditions, earthworms and enchytraeids could coexist without competitive exclusion.",['sdv']
Generation of 3D Spatially Variable Anisotropy for Groundwater Flow Simulations,"Sedimentary units generally present anisotropy in their hydraulic properties, with higher hydraulic conductivity along bedding planes, rather than perpendicular to them. This common property leads to a modeling challenge if the sedimentary structure is folded. In this paper, we show that the gradient of the geological potential used by implicit geological modeling techniques can be used to compute full hydraulic conductivity tensors varying in space according to the geological orientation. For that purpose, the gradient of the potential, a vector normal to the bedding, is used to construct a rotation matrix that allows the estimation of the 3D hydraulic conductivity tensor in a single matrix operation. A synthetic 2D cross section example is used to illustrate the method and show that flow simulations performed in such a folded environment are highly influenced by this rotating anisotropy. When using the proposed method, the streamlines follow very closely the folded formation. This is not the case with an isotropic model.",['phys']

Potato samples showed values of isotropicity always around 1.2, meaning that shrinkage was slightly more important in the longitudinal direction.",['spi']
Modelling mechanical properties of spruce and Douglas fir timber by means of X-ray and grain angle measurements for strength grading purpose,"This study proposes a model using data from a scanner (X-ray and grain angle measurements) to perform strength grading. The research also includes global measurements of modulus of elasticity (obtained by vibrations and ultrasound methods), static bending stiffness and bending strength of 805 boards of Douglas fir and 437 boards of spruce. This model can be used in an industrial context since it requires low computational time. The results of this study show that the developed model gives better results than the global non-destructive measurements of the elastic modulus commonly used in the industry. It also shows that this improvement is particularly higher in the case of Douglas fir than for spruce. The comparison has been made on both the quality of the mechanical properties assessment and on the improvement of the grading process according to the European standards by using different index.",['spi']
Iron complexes as potential photocatalysts for controlled radical photopolymerizations: A tool for modifications and patterning of surfaces,"This article reports on the presumably first use of iron complexes (FeC) as potential photocatalysts for controlled radical photopolymerization reactions (CRP2). Three compounds were designed and investigated. Good linear evolutions of the molecular weight (Mn) with the conversion were observed. A comparison was provided with a reference iridium (III) complex [Ir(ppy)3 where ppy stands for 2-phenylpyridine]. The on/off photopolymerization experiments highlight the presence of dormant species and a re-initiation on demand upon irradiation. This unique re-initiation property was used for the modification of surfaces (hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties) and surface patterning as well as the synthesis of a block co-polymer (PMMA-b-PBA). A comparative analysis of the behavior of these iron complexes in thermally and photochemically activated polymerization was provided. The chemical mechanisms were studied by steady state photolysis, laser flash photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, luminescence quenching, and electron spin resonance experiments. A catalytic cycle was proposed with two steps: (i) the oxidation of the FeC excited state by an alkyl halide and (ii) the reduction by the oxidized form (FeC°+) by an amine or the macroradicals leading to the regeneration of the catalyst.",['chim']
High order structural image decomposition by using non-linear and non-convex regularizing objectives,The paper addresses structural decomposition of images by using a family of non-linear and non-convex objective functions. These functions rely on p quasi-norm estimation costs in a piecewise constant regularization framework.

The paper shows that these regularizing objectives yield image texture-versus-cartoon decompositions that cannot be reached by using standard penalized least square regularizations associated with smooth and convex objectives.,"['math', 'spi']"
Oligomeric photocatalysts in photoredox catalysis: towards high performance and low migration polymerization photoinitiating systems,"In the present paper, four fluorescent materials currently used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) are presented in an original way as high performance photocatalysts usable in polymerization photoinitiating systems. Their performance is excellent in free radical polymerization, cationic polymerization but also in the synthesis of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs). A coherent picture of the chemical mechanisms involved in these new photocatalytic systems is provided. Remarkably, an oligomeric and copolymerizable photocatalyst (PVD2) is proposed here for the first time, i.e., both the high molecular weight of PVD2 and the presence of reactive double bonds as end groups (which could be involved in a copolymerization reaction) ensure a very low migration of the catalyst from the synthesized polymer.",['chim']
Photocatalyzed Cu-based ATRP involving an oxidative quenching mechanism under visible light,"A new type of photocatalyzed Cu-based atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is described, involving directly the light absorption of the activator form of the copper complex Cu(I). The selected catalyst was bis(1,10-phenanthroline)copper(I), Cu(phen)2+, due to its intense absorption in the visible domain, which permitted to use very soft irradiation conditions, consisting of a simple household blue LED at 0.9 W. An excellent control over the polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in dimethylformamide (DMF) was observed under irradiation in these conditions, using ethyl α-bromophenylacetate (EBPA) as the initiator, with polydispersity indexes (PDI) as low as 1.10 while using low catalyst content (80 ppm). The proposed mechanism implies first the formation under irradiation of the excited state of the activator form of the complex Cu(I)*. It can then rapidly undergo the oxidative quenching of the alkyl bromide, which results in its conversion into the deactivator form of the complex Cu(II)–Br along with the generation of a propagating radical. The setting up of the ATRP equilibrium ensues. Additionally, it was possible to complete the catalysis mechanism by adding triethylamine (TEA), which permitted a faster polymerization, thanks to a faster regeneration of the activator Cu(I). An excellent control over the polymerization was also observed in the presence of TEA, with PDI as low as 1.06. The addition of TEA allowed also to use a catalyst loading as low as 20 ppm, while maintaining a good controllability.",['chim']

Dynamic Painting of Animated 3D scenes,"Painterly rendering is a technique that takes inspiration from traditional painting, such as oil or acrylic. The main idea is to render a 3D scene with 2D strokes in image space. Creating hand made painterly animations is very time-consuming since each frame of the animation is usually obtained by adding some paint strokes over previous frames. With an automated system, a user can not only build his animation faster but can handle the temporal coherence of strokes via a frame-to-frame correspondence. In our system the strokes follow the motion of objects (as in Meier's system [Mei96]) and faithfully represent some of their properties (depth and reflectance), while enabling the user to specify a painting style.",['info']

Interactive Indirect Illumination Using Voxel Cone Tracing: An Insight,"(Siggraph 2011 Talk) Indirect illumination is an important element for realistic image synthesis, but its computation is expensive and highly dependent on the complexity of the scene and of the BRDF of the surfaces involved. While off-line computation and pre-baking can be acceptable for some cases, many applications (games, simulators, etc.) require real-time or interactive approaches to evaluate indirect illumination. We present a novel algorithm to compute indirect lighting in real-time that avoids costly precomputation steps and is not restricted to low frequency illumination. It is based on a hierarchical voxel octree representation generated and updated on-the-fly from a regular scene mesh coupled with an approximate voxel cone tracing that allows a fast estimation of the visibility and incoming energy. Our approach can manage two light bounces for both Lambertian and Glossy materials at interactive framerates (25-70FPS).

How price display influences consumer luxury perceptions,"This article investigates the impact of price display in the luxury sector, which has always been thought of as “bad practice” in luxury marketing but never explored empirically. Taking an experimental approach, the study shows that in the case of brands in the premium luxury segment, price display may have a positive influence on luxury perceptions, and more specifically on perceived brand uniqueness and conspicuousness, which in turn may transfer to brand attitude and desirability. As this runs counter to common wisdom, the findings of this study provide a number of noteworthy theoretical insights and interesting managerial implications.",['shs']

Designing local well-being indicators : the case of the Grenoble metropolitan area,"Across international, European, national and local scales, the emergence of new socio-environmental indicators highlights the need to develop appropriate measurement strategies. In France, the limitations of existing data for assessing and planning public initiatives led a number of professionals in the Grenoble metropolitan area to look at what could be hidden from existing data, notably for social and environmental aspects. A collective of urban-policy stakeholders and researchers from Grenoble University came together to question conventional local observation tools and develop a new approach. The Grenoble project’s sustainable territorial social indicators – Indicateurs de bien-etre sociaux territorialisés (IBEST) in French – are now being tested in select regional municipalities.",['shs']

Pursuing the concept of luxury : Introduction to the JBR Special Issue on “Luxury Marketing from Tradition to Innovation”,"Despite centuries of criticisms of luxury, the sector continues to grow, rapidly, globally, and especially in countries that previously lacked any such market. Structural changes in the types of sales and consumers affect the concept of luxury for consumers. In contrast with traditional perceptions of luxury consumers as a homogeneous group of “happy few,” multiple, contrasted segments now emerge among luxury clientele, who perceive the meaning of luxury very heterogeneously. In this setting, researchers need new criteria to define luxury. These criteria also must account for the ever increasing role of the Internet in luxury marketing and sales. In addition to posing new questions and research avenues, this editorial offers a brief overview of the seven papers in this special issue, which is an outgrowth of the 2014 Monaco Symposium on Luxury, organized by INSEEC Business School and the International University of Monaco.",['shs']
What are the environmental benefits of increasing the WEEE treatment in France?,"In France is estimated a generation of about 17 and 23 kg per year of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) per inhabitant, however, in 2014, the return rate for household WEEE hardly reaches 38% of the total market input. The French regulation targets a higher collection rate for the next years: 45% between 2016 and 2019, and 65% after 2019. Besides complying with the regulations, improving WEEE treatment represents an environmental and economic opportunity. The aim of this work was to quantify the benefits of improving the treatment of WEEE in France by the life cycle assessment methodology. A mobile phone charger was selected as a case study, and three scenarios were assessed based on the actual collection rate and the future recycling targets. The optimization of the reverse logistic and the transition to renewable energies are crucial points to reduce the environmental impacts of the recycling channel.",['sde']
Nonlinear discrete mechanical model of steel ringsModèle mécanique discret non linéaire d'anneaux en acier,Circular rings are used in various engineering structures because of their nonlinear properties. The use of large assemblies of steel rings in flexible ring nets is widespread in recent technologies of protection structures and their design requires a nonlinear and computationally efficient mechanical modeling. This paper presents an innovative discrete model of steel rings for application in flexible protection structures. The model aims at providing an effective mechanical response of the net at both the local ring scale and the global net scale. Two different uniaxial tension configurations are defined as reference loading cases and the nonlinear analytical response of the ring model to these loading cases is established. A multicriteria numerical method based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is developed to calibrate the model parameters from experimental data. An experimental campaign on steel wire spliced rings of different dimensions is conducted and permits the calibration and validation of the model.,['sde']
Applying and theorizing institutional frameworks in IS research: A systematic analysis from 1999 to 2009,"This paper investigates how Information Systems (IS) researchers apply institutional theoretical frameworks. The purpose of this paper is to explore the operationalization of meta-theoretical frameworks for empirical research which can often present difficulties in IS research. The authors include theoretical, methodological and empirical aspects to explore modalities of use and suggest further avenues. After an overview of institutional concepts, the authors carry out a thematic analysis of journal papers on IS and institutional frameworks indexed in EBSCO and ABI databases from 1999 to 2009. This consists of descriptive, thematic coding and cluster analysis of this textual database, this combined qualitative and quantitative method offers a unique way of analyzing how operationalization is carried out. The findings suggest three groups of publications which represent different methodological approaches and empirical foci: “descriptive exploratory approaches,” “generalizing approaches,” and “sociological approaches.” The authors suggest that these three groups represent possible patterns of the use of “meta” social theories in IS research, reflecting a search for disciplinary legitimacy. This helps us analyze papers according to how they use and apply theories. The authors identify the “organizing vision” and the regulatory approach as two institutionalist “intermediary” concepts developed by IS researchers. Furthermore, the authors find that institutional theoretical frameworks have been used in “direct,” “intermediary” or “combined” conceptualizations. The authors also confirm the dynamism of the IS institutional research stream, as evidenced by the increase in number of articles between 1999 and 2009, and identify a maturation process of the IS field in investigating a social theory. The evolution the authors identify in the application of institutional theoretical frameworks in the IS field reveals conformity in methodological, theoretical and empirical terms. By identifying these patterns, it becomes possible to understand institutional reasons for their existence and legitimacy; and to propose other avenues of exploration in future IS research, such as combining different theoretical lenses in institutional frameworks. The methodological contribution is to provide an innovative methodology which helps describe categories and levels of institutional theoretical frameworks used, leading to the identification of gaps and proposing further avenues of research.",['shs']
"Mandatory environmental disclosures by companies complying with IASs/IFRSs. The cases of France, Germany and UK","This study investigates whether the adoption of a single set of accounting standards, such as IAS/IFRS, guarantees the harmonization of accounting practices within a country and across countries, or whether differences in reporting practices persist because of dissimilarities in reporting habits and institutional settings. To this end, we investigate whether the level of environmental disclosure under IFRS is related to the size of the reporting firm, and the strength of legal and regulatory constraints on environmental disclosures in the country where the firm is domiciled. Results indicate (1) that environmental disclosures imposed by IFRS increase with firm size and (2) that firms domiciled in countries with constraining environmental disclosure regulations (i.e. France and the UK) report more on environmental issues than firms domiciled in countries with weakly constraining regulations (i.e. Germany). This suggests a strong impact of national regulations on IFRS reporting. Taken as a whole, our results support the view that IFRS are not applied consistently across firms and across countries, notably because of persistence of reporting traditions and discrepancies in national legal requirements.",['shs']

Drivers and barriers to pre-adoption of strategic scanning information system in the context of sustainable supply chain,"This research is reporting on the pre-adoption of Strategic Scanning (S.Scan) information systems (IS). More specifically, it relates to the pre-adoption phase, that is, the emergence of the idea of such a system and the evaluation of its need for the organization, upstream of any technological consideration. The research question is the following: what are the drivers and barriers that influence the pre-adoption of a S.Scan IS? The objective of this research is to extend knowledge on a subject that has received little attention from the scholars. Research’s originality relies on the use of isomorphic processes from neo-institu- tional framework to study pre-adoption in the field of S.Scan. On the basis of a multi- method research combining qualitative and quantitative exploratory studies in the specific field of sustainable supply chains (SSC), our results highlight 31 drivers and barriers to pre- adoption of S.Scan IS, ten of which have not been identified before, and five types of pres- sures. They therefore suggest that pre-adoption of S.Scan IS can be subject to both func- tional and institutional pressures. It can be driven either by competitiveness or conformism pressures, and hindered by performance objectives or lack of coercive pressures. Finally, these results put a question mark about the understanding of the strategic dimension of S.Scan IS by organisations, and the government’s role and its responsibility for promoting SSC initiatives and for the adoption of S.Scan IS on this issue.",['shs']
Career scripts in clusters: A social position approach,"This article examines the career scripts held by individuals working in clusters by studying the careers seen as desirable and possible by 42 micro-nanotechnology and computer science researchers in the ‘Minalogic’ cluster, the French equivalent of Silicon Valley. We consider the links between the researchers’ career scripts and their social positions and identify six discrete career scripts that we label organizational nomad, entrepreneurial, organizational extension, cloister, escape and conversion. Central social positions in the cluster are linked with boundaryless career scripts (organizational nomad and entrepreneurial scripts), but individuals also use the resources associated with their central social positions to envisage both extending their careers and the range of tasks they undertake (organizational extension script) within their employing organizations. Others − those holding peripheral social positions − may be unable to match the cluster’s expectations, and so feel trapped in involuntary immobility (cloister script), constrained to leave the cluster (escape script) or to change their occupations or broaden their skill sets to advance their careers within it (conversion script). Our article goes beyond simply using scripts as descriptions to propose a more comprehensive approach by highlighting the social dimension of career scripts. Our results qualify the supposed predominance of the boundaryless career notion by confronting it with the wider generic notion of the career script, so proposing a more complete description of how a cluster shapes individuals’ career definitions and aspirations, as well as a more complex theorization of how those careers are influenced by the cluster context.",['shs']
Convergence dans les modèles fractionnaires,"Nous rappelons les résultats de Cramér et Leadbetter (resp. de S.M.

L'auteur developpe la comparaison de la pluriactivite dans les exploitations agricoles a travers les divers pays europeens. En ce qui concerne l'exercice de plusieurs activites par le chef d'exploitation, tout d'abord, il apparait que selon le type de structures agricoles il est possible de regrouper les pays en trois categories. La France voisine avec l'Allemagne Federale, la Belgique et la Hollande dans la categorie ou les exploitations pluriactives sont nettement plus repandues parmi celles qui ont un petite taille, 5 ha ou moins. Pour les pays de petites structures Italie et Grece, la pratique de la pluriactivite par le chef d'exploitation est moins nettement concentree dans les petites exploitations tandis que dans les pays ou les petites exploitations sont peu presentes, c'est parmi elles que se concentre fortement la pluriactivite. La France est le seul pays qui ait vu recemment une nette augmentation de l'exercice d'un emploi a l'exterieur de l'exploitation par le conjoint de l'exploitant. Entre 1980 et 1983, dans les pays de relativement ""grandes"" structures, l'accroissement de la pluriactivite s'est poursuivi, alors qu'en Italie, pays presentant de ""petites"" structures, la pluriactivite a plutot eu tendance a diminuer.

The Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on Organizational Commitment: Exploring Multiple Mediation Mechanisms,"Unlike previous studies that examine the direct effect of employees’ perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) on affective organizational commitment (AOC), this article examines a mediated link through organizational trust and organizational identification. Social exchange and social identity theory provide the foundation for predictions that the primary outcomes of CSR initiatives are organizational trust and organizational identification, which in turn affect AOC. The test of the research model relies on data collected from 378 employees of local and multinational companies in South Asia, as well as structural equation modeling to test the postulated relationships. Both organizational trust and organizational identification fully mediate the CSR–AOC link. However, the identification mechanism is significantly stronger than the trust mechanism in terms of building AOC from CSR. Out of four CSR components, CSR toward employees is the strongest predictor of employees’ trust, identification, and AOC, followed by CSR toward community, whereas CSR toward the environment has no effect. Finally, CSR toward community and employees are more associated with social exchange, whereas CSR toward consumers relates more to the social identity process.",['shs']
Consumption community commitment: Newbies and longstanding members´ brand engagement and loyalty,"The relationships among members of virtual brand-related communities may change depending on the length of their participation in the community. Consumers' commitment to the community is likely to influence the relationship between consumer engagement in the community and brand loyalty. Commitment can be affective, calculative, and normative. Knowledge concerning the impact of these dimensions on behavioral loyalty to a brand over membership time is lacking. This study examines the changing relationship between consumers' engagement in a consumption community, their kind of commitment to the community and their behavioral loyalty to a brand over membership time. Members of a French virtual community sharing photography interests participated in the sample. Configural analysis shows that strong engagement in community activities alone is neither sufficient nor necessary for brand loyal intentions. Combinations of engagement with various levels of affective, calculative and normative commitment to the community can cause high behavioral brand loyalty of community members. These combinations change with the length of membership in the community. Brand managers can use the results to fine-tune their communication to groups of community members with different combinations of engagement and commitment as drivers of brand loyalty.",['shs']
Socio-economic aspects of the diversification of agricultureAspects socio-economiques de la diversification de l'agriculture,"La communication rappelle les imperieuses raisons de la reorientation de la production agricole vers des produits a usage non alimentaire.

A Historiographical Review of Research concerning Accounting Changes in Post-communist Economies,"This paper reviews 107 academic research publications appearing between 1988 and 2011 that studied accounting changes in post-communist economies. While there has been a significant amount of prior research focusing on accounting changes in economies undergoing the transition from communism to a market economy, there has been a lack of synthesis and overview of the literature in this field. In order to develop such a synthesis and overview, the reviewed publications have been categorized according to a framework proposed by Barbu (2006), and then further classified into changes pertaining to accounting institutions, changes in accounting systems (i.e. legislation, principles and standards), and interactions between economic changes and accounting changes. We then interpret our findings through several theoretical frameworks that provide explanations regarding relationships between economic changes (i.e. in particular the transition from communism to a market economy) and accounting changes. This analysis has led to a proposed new framework to better understand relationships between economic changes and accounting changes during the transition from communism to a market-based economy.",['shs']
"LEGO, PICTIONARY AND POKER: LESSONS LEARNT FROM GAMIFICATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEM TEACHING AT UNIVERSITY","Our context is the teaching of information systems at the license level of a technical institute. It requires technical knowledge as well as managerial one. In this context, an important part of the teaching concerns modelling of data that will be manipulated by the system and projects management for building systems. To facilitate learning and improving students' results, we investigated the Elaboration phase of the BSCS 5E Instructional Model as well as the Concrete Experience stage of Kolb experiential learning cycle and we experimented gamification in some of our teaching activities. This paper presents four case studies in gamification for information systems teaching: one of them is related to the learning of data modelling with a personalized version of the Pictionary, the two others concern project management with Legos and Poker. These case studies clearly show the usefulness of gamification in learning.",['info']
Experimental validation of a patient-specific model of orthotic action in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis,"Purpose Personalized modeling of brace action have potential in improving brace efficacy in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Model validation and simulation uncertainty are rarely addressed, limiting the clinical implementation of personalized models. We hypothesized that a thorough validation of a personalized finite element model (FEM) of brace action would highlight potential means of improving the model. Methods 42 AIS patients were included retrospectively and prospectively. Personalized FEMs of pelvis, spine and ribcage were built from stereoradiographies. Brace action was simulated through soft cylindrical pads acting on the ribcage and through displacements applied to key vertebrae. Simulation root mean squared errors (RMSEs) were calculated by comparison with the actual brace action (quantified through clinical indices, vertebral positions and orientations) observed in in-brace stereoradiographies. Results Simulation RMSEs of Cobb angle and vertebral apical axial rotation was lower than measurement uncertainty in 79% of the patients. Pooling all patients and clinical indices, 87 % of the indices had lower RMSEs than the measurement uncertainty. Conclusions In-depth analysis suggests that personalization of spinal functional units mechanical properties could improve the simulation’s accuracy, but the model gave good results, thus justifying further research on its clinical application.","['sdv', 'spi']"

Our goal is to increase students' creativity and self-confidence in the concept application phase of the learning cycle. So we introduced pedagogy based on project and action, which followed the 5 key-principles of gamification. This case study has changed the students' approach and behaviour relatively to courses and teachers.

New tension mechanism for high-Speed tensile testing machine,"As concerns of dynamic tensile measuring, a new tension mechanism driven by liner motor in High-Speed Tensile Testing Machine is presented. It satisfies the requirements for testing the dynamic tensile properties of plastic materials with strain rates from 1 to 100s-1. For this purpose the idle stroke principle is used to realize the dynamic load of plastic material with static grip. Computer Aided Engineering technology is used: i).to analyze and optimize the tension mechanism thus allowing reducing the system shock caused by collisions. ii). to avoid the influence of plastic materials specimen stress and strain uniformity on the measuring system. The analysis results agreed well with the established empirical relationships based on experimental evidence.

Considering Aesthetics and Usability Temporalities in a Model Based Development ProcessPrise en compte de l'esthétique et de l'utilisabilité dans un processus de développement basé sur les modèles,"Model driven engineering provides solutions to create user interfaces (UI), especially in the case of complex UIs such as adaptable UIs. However, they suffer from the poor quality of the generated UIs. This paper addresses this drawback by integrating aesthetics and usability study steps in a model driven development process, based in the M2Flex metamodel. M2Flex was used to define a “flexibilized” version of the UsiXML methodology, which is dedicated to the development of adaptable UIs. Adjustments to the “flexibilized” version of the UsiXML are submitted to be consistent with the findings of an experiment which shows that shows that 1) perceived aesthetics improves the user’s evaluation only at the mere exposure stage; 2) usability improves the users’ evaluation only after some use experience.L’ingénierie dirigée par les modèles offre des solutions pour créer interfaces utilisateurs, en particulier dans le cas d’interfaces complexes, comme celles adaptables à leur contexte d’usage.

"ProSPer: modeling the change, driving the persuasionProSPer : modélisation du changement, piloter la persuasion","The development of persuasive interactive systems is typically achieved in an opportunistic way for shipping one persuasive system at a time, thus negatively affecting internal modularity (persuasion concepts are typically mixed up throughout the development life cycle) and reusability (parts or the whole persuasive system is of little reuse for another domain of human activity). In order to address these challenges, this paper introduces, motivates, and defines MOST4P, a Mission-Operation-Strategy-Tactic 4-level model for structuring the development of a persuasive interactive system and ProSPer, a MOST4P-based framework for developing persuasive interactive systems, software-based and/or manual-based that explicitly satisfy modularity (MOST concepts satisfy the separation of concerns) and multiple-domain applicability (MOST concepts could be reused from one domain to another). The paper then reports on a pilot study involving twelve participants evaluating how MOST4P concepts have been used in a self monitoring bracelet and in a mobile ProSPerbased persuasive interactive system. This study suggests that overall subjective satisfaction and usefulness are the most appreciated criteria, followed by interaction and information qualities.Les systèmes interactifs persuasifs existants sont en grande majorité conçus pour un unique domaine d'application affectant de facto certaines propriétés logicielles comme: la modularité logicielle (éparpillement des mécanismes relatifs à la persuasion) et la réutilisabilité (forte dépendance à un domaine d'application et transposition complexe vers un autre domaine). Face à ces défis, cet article introduit et développe (1) la technique MOST (Mission-Operation-Strategy-Tactic) comme modèle à quatre niveaux structurant le développement de systèmes interactifs persuasifs ainsi que (2) ProSper, un cadre de conception des systèmes interactifs persuasifs basé sur MOST, visant à répondre au critère de modularité (MOST4P permet de traiter la séparation des préoccupations) et au besoin de généricité (l'approche MOST s'applique à tout domaine d'application).

TraceViz: a Visualization Framework for Interactive Analysis of Execution TracesTraceViz: une Plateforme de Visualisation pour l'Analyse Interactive de Traces d'Exécution,"Hardware platforms of embedded systems are more powerful at each new generation thank to the integration of System-on-Chip (SoC). Developing streaming multimedia applications on embedded systems becomes an increasingly complex process. Modern applications are highly multi-threaded and have to decode the multimedia stream in real time to prevent the apparition of audio and video artifacts. Debugging this kind of issue cannot be done with traditional debuggers that interrupt the decoding and perturb the synchronization of the different threads. The solution is to record all the events that occurred during the decoding in a trace and perform the analysis post-mortem. There exists many visualization tools to analyze execution traces but they have reached their limits with the amount of data generated by modern applications. They either provide a too generalized representation to be useful, or they show too much details leading to a fastidious data exploration. We propose a novel interaction visualization framework to address these problems. In particular, our contribution is in two parts: (a) we present a new fast backend suitable for the interactive browsing of huge traces and (b) a new visualization tool to explore the trace at different level of details.Les plateformes matérielles pour systèmes embarqués deviennent plus puissantes à chaque nouvelle génération grâce à l’intégration de système sur une puce (Systemon-Chip ou SoC).

A comparative analysis of food demand and its determinants in six EU countries,"This cross-country investigation of food demand and its determinants confirmed a number of stylized facts: first, consumers respond to prices and the law of demand applies to all foods at a fairly high level of product disaggregation; second, most food products are necessities, as their demand responds positively but less than proportionally to changes in consumption expenditure, implying that Engle’s law is also ve-rified in all countries; third, for all countries, some cross-price elasticities are both statistically significant and relatively large, which confirms the necessity of considering whole diets rather than only subsets of foods when analyzing policies to enhance the sustainability of food consumption patterns. Beyond those well-known regularities, however, the analysis indicates that demand relationships remain highly specific to each country.",['shs']
Using Complex-Network properties For Efficient Graph Analysis,"Complex networks are set of entities in a relationship, modeled by graphs where nodes represent entities and edges between nodes represent relationships. Graph algorithms have inherent characteristics, including data-driven computations and poor locality. These characteristics expose graph algorithms to several challenges; this is because most well studied (parallel) abstractions and implementation are not suitable for them. This work shows how we use some complex-network properties, including community structure and heterogeneity of node degree, to tackle one of the main challenges: improving performance, by improving memory location and by providing proper thread scheduling. In this paper, we firstly formalize complex-network ordering for cache misses reducing as a well known NP-Complete problem, the optimal linear arrangement problem; we then propose cn-order an heuristic that outperforms very recent graph orders. Secondly, we formalize degree-aware scheduling problem as another well known NP-Complete problem, the multiple knapsack problem; then we propose two degree-aware heuristics to solve it. We finally validate our theoretical observations with experiments on a 32 cores NUMA machine with some graph algorithms and some stanford graph datasets. For example, some results with Pagerank algorithm and livejournal dataset show that using cn-order improves performance by reducing cache misses and hence time by 41%; and when cn-order is combined with degree-aware scheduling, time is reduced by 50% due to load balancing among threads.",['info']
Crowdfunding success and failure: what actually happens during a campaign,"What is behind crowdfunding’s success? Is simply asking for help enough to tap into the reservoir of altruism present on the Internet? Well, it is not so easy. Only about half of all crowdfunding campaigns actually get funded, and the extent of funding varies considerably across projects. Many dismally fail. What makes the difference to reach the project’s funding goal and what actually happens in the process of the funding campaign? Are crowdfunders affected by the funding decisions of others and to what extent is project success path-dependent, determined by very early pledges? Do project launchers try to exploit the relative anonymity of the Internet to contribute to their own projects? In a recently published article, the authors explore these questions using data provided by Startnext, the biggest German crowdfunding platform. Startnext gave us access to its whole database – more than 100,000 pledges to more than 2,000 projects. The answers indicate that it is never too late to get a campaign on a successful track – provided its creator manages to get a surge in pledges rolling.",['shs']

Length perception in virtual reality environment,"Today simulation platforms in Virtual Reality Environment (VRE) play a very important role during the initial design phase of products throughout the Product Life-Cycle (PLC). However, current simulation platforms do not offer the necessary information and versatility required for a complete perception process in simulation and evaluation. This paper deals with a new method for measuring the influence of Virtual Reality on the perceived length of an object (e.g. a bar). The method is based on the assessment of the length of a part by the subject, with two sources of visual information. The first one is the screen of the VRE where the movements are displayed, with different coefficients Ceb=(object length displayed on the screen)/(length of the arm’s movement). The other source is a set of two crossed meters (measuring tapes) situated on the wall behind the subject. The method is validated by a set of experimental tests performed in a Virtual Reality Environment. The results show that subjects are more likely influenced by the movement of the arm rather than the length of the arm displayed on the screen. Moreover, the length’s perception of subjects is modified when moving direction changes (horizontal or vertical) or when putting/placing a meter (measuring tape) in the subject’s field of view. The horizontal bar or the meter (measuring tape) leads them to choose lengths closer to what they are seeing on the screen, than when the bar is vertical or without meter. The proposed method provides the feasibility to integrate the visual perception into length evaluation via VRE when performing disassembly operation simulations for instance.",['spi']
Disassembly Process Simulation in Virtual Reality Environment,"Integration of disassembly operations simulation during product design is an important issue today. A method for ergonomic evaluation of disassembly opera-tions is presented here. It is based on three new criteria, presented by dimension-less coefficients: visibility score, neck score and bending score. The method is in-tegrated in a Virtual Reality Disassembly Environment (VRDE) based on Python programming language using mixed VTK (Visualization Toolkit) and ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) libraries. The framework is based on STEP, WRL and STL ex-change formats. The proposed method is tested and an example for disassembly sequences evaluation is presented.

Virtual disassembly sequences generation and evaluation,"First this paper presents a method for generating selective disassembly sequences. The method is based on the Lowest levels of a disassembly product graph. Instead of considering the geometric constraints for each pair of components, the proposed method considers the geometric contact and collision relationships among the components in order to generate the so-called Disassembly Geometry Contacting Graph (DGCG). The latter is then used for disassembly sequence generation thus allowing the number of possible sequences to be reduced by ignoring the components which are unrelated to the target. A simulation framework was developed and integrated in a Virtual reality environment (VRE) thus allowing generating the minimum number of possible disassembly sequences. Secondly, a method for disassembly operation evaluation by 3D geometric removability analysis in a VRE is proposed. It is based on seven new criteria divided into two categories: i). for ergonomic evaluation, ii). and for traditional processing evaluation. All criteria are presented by dimensionless coefficients automatically calculated, thus allowing evaluating disassembly sequences complexity. For this purpose, a Virtual Reality disassembly environment (VRDE) is developed based on Python programming language, utilizing mixed VTK (Visualization Toolkit) and ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) libraries. The framework is based on STEP, WRL and STL exchange formats. The analysis results and findings demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach thus providing significant assistance for the evaluation of disassembly sequences during Product Development Process (PDP).",['spi']
Virtual reality environment for fatigue disassembly task evaluation,"This paper aims to better understand how Virtual reality (VR) is influencing on human behavior with using biomechanical analysis methods and its application for assembly/disassembly operations simulation in particular. For this purpose, a new haptic model for mechanical energy expenditure is proposed where the required mechanical work is used as main parameter. Then, the fatigue levels are evaluated by analyzing the recorded electromyography (EMG) signal on the four involved muscles of operator’s arm. The proposed method is validated by a set of experimental disassembly tests performed in a VR environment. The comparison of the analytical and experimental results has shown good correlation between them. The proposed method provides the feasibility to integrate human muscle fatigue into disassembly sequence evaluation via mechanical energy expenditure when performing disassembly operation simulations in the initial stage of product design.",['spi']
[OGM] Un marché complètement modifié,"L'introduction des organismes génétiquement modifiés s'est accompagnée d'une concentration de l'offre de semences et de pesticides, aujourd'hui dans les mains de quelques multinationales. En décembre 2015, les entreprises américaines Dow Chemical et DuPont, deux multinationales de la chimie très présentes dans l'agriculture, annonçaient leur fusion. Au même moment, un autre géant américain, Monsanto, tentait d'acquérir son concurrent Syngenta, qui a finalement préféré l'offre de la firme chinoise ChemChina. Ces différents acteurs font aujourd'hui partie des leaders dans l'offre de semences et de pesticides aux agriculteurs. La chute des cours agricoles a induit une baisse significative de leur activité et explique en bonne partie ces regroupements. Ces évènements constituent une nouvelle étape dans la restructuration du monde la fourniture agricole qui se déroule depuis plus de vingt ans.

Minimal RPI sets computation for polytopic systems using the Bounded-real lemma and a new shrinking procedure,"This paper deals with the problem of computing the minimal robustly positive invariant-set s (mRPI sets) for discrete-time linear and polytopic systems. Here, the subsystems, which describe a polytopic system, are assumed to be stable in presence of bounded disturbances and, in addition, to share a common Lyapunov function. The proposed approach is based on the computation of “ellipsoidal” RPI sets which are obtained by using the Bounded-real lemma. After that, a RPI outer-approximation of the minimal “polyhedral” RPI set for the polytopic system is obtained by applying a novel shrinking process. A shrinking index, which depends on the number of iterations, is proposed as an indicator of the approximation error. Thus, the method provides mRPI set approximations that are always invariant sets at any step of the algorithm, and allows the a priori choice of a desired precision. Two numerical examples illustrate the application of a such method.",['spi']
Building new entities from existing titanium part by electron beam melting: microstructures and mechanical properties,"Electron beam melting (EBM) has been recognized as an emerging additive manufacturing technology, which allows the production of fully dense parts from various metals. The technique builds parts using an electron beam to melt metal powder, layer by layer, in a powder bed. Thus, complex parts, including internal structures, can be made directly from 3D CAD models without special fixtures and cutting tools. Much research is conducted to study the microstructure and mechanical properties of EBM-built parts or to investigate the effects of EBM process parameters on the quality of parts. However, using EBM for building new features on an existing part has received little attention from the research community. Due to its performance, EBM seems able to transform an end-of-life (EoL) part/existing part into a new part without returning to the level of raw material. The aim of this study is to validate such principle. In this paper, an EBM machine was used to produce new Ti-6Al-4V features on a Ti-6Al-4V plate, which was considered as a useful core retrieved from an EoL product. The built samples, including EBM-built features and Ti-6Al-4V plate, were investigated in terms of their microstructure and mechanical properties. The results showed that EBM technique allows new features with a suitable microstructure and controlled mechanical properties to be built on an existing part. Moreover, the EBM-built features have a strong bond with the existing part leading to the same mechanical characteristics as original part. These demonstrate that the EBM technology has a promising potential for producing new parts from EoL parts/existing parts.",['spi']
"IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING SYNERGY BETWEEN LiDAR, RADARSAT-2 AND SPOT-5 IMAGES FOR THE DETECTION AND MAPPING OF WETLAND VEGETATION IN THE DANUBE DELTA","Wetlands are among the most productive natural environments on Earth, as they harbor exceptional biological diversity. For this paper, our study site was the Danube Delta. The biodiversity of the Danube Delta is extraordinary and it possesses one of the largest reed beds in the world. The main goal of our paper was to recognize, characterize and map the main vegetation units of the Danube Delta. The paper emphasizes the importance of the joint use of LiDAR measurements (acquired in May 2011), RADARSAT-2 radar data (acquired on 4 June 2011) and SPOT-5 optical data (acquired on 25 May 2011). LiDAR data allow for the characterization of vegetation height within centimeter accuracy (10 cm). The radar measurements are based on C-band, providing additional information about the structure of the vegetation cover. The simultaneous acquisition of HH, HV, VV and VH polarizations enabled us to discriminate between the targets, depending on their responses to the various polarizations, by calculating their polarimetric signatures. By linking multispectral LiDAR and radar data, information can be obtained about vegetation reflectance and height as well as the backscattering mechanism, allowing for improved mapping and characterization accuracy (90.60% mean accuracy). An accuracy assessment of the classification results was evaluated against the vegetation data recorded in the field.","['sde', 'spi', 'shs']"

Grape solids: composition and impact on alcoholic fermentation,"During alcoholic fermentation, grape solids provide sterols which are necessary for yeast metabolism in anaerobic conditions. The objective of the study aimed i) to better know the sterols composition and content of the grape solids, ii) to determine their impact on the liquid-phase alcoholic fermentation. Seven samples of grape solids obtained from different grape varieties were studied. Sterols content of these grape solids varied from 4 to 11 mg/g of dry matter, ß-sitostérol being the most abundant sterol (approximately 80 % of total sterols). The impact of grape solids on alcoholic fermentation was first studied at the laboratory scale in 1 L fermentors. Each solid particles sample was added to a synthetic must (simulating a must for white winemaking) in order to obtain a standardized addition of 1 mg of phytostérols/L. A control (synthetic must without added particles) was also realized. The turbidity of musts supplied with 1 mg of phytosérols/L varies from 14 à 38 NTU, depending on their origin. Results of the experimental fermentation show that the initial sterols content of the must is a key factor of the alcoholic fermentation. Indeed, when sterols are the limiting factor of the alcoholic fermentation, their presence strongly increased the yeast population and the CO2 production rate. This positive effect can be explained by the fact that sterols improve yeast nitrogen assimilation. A second experiment highlighted that i) nitrogen assimilation increases until sterols represent the limiting factor, ii) the quantity of assimilated nitrogen depends on the yeast strain. In white or rosé winemaking, a suitable concentration of solid particles remains necessary to ensure a complete nitrogen assimilation by yeasts. The higher must assimilable nitrogen must content, the higher sterols concentration allowing the whole yeast nitrogen assimilation is. These results highlight the significance of the balance between these two key nutriments for the control of the fermentation in clarified liquid-phase winemaking.Au cours de la fermentation alcoolique, les particules solides présentes dans le moût de raisin apportent aux levures des phytostérols nécessaires à leur métabolisme en conditions d’anaérobiose. L’objectif des recherches menées consistait à : i) mieux connaitre la composition et la teneur en phytostérols des particules, ii) déterminer leur impact sur la fermentation alcoolique en phase liquide. Un lot de 7 bourbes de cépages différents a été étudié. La teneur en phytostérols des particules solides issues de ces bourbes variait de 4 à 11 mg/g de matière sèche, le β-sitostérol étant le phytostérol majoritaire (environ 80 % des phytostérols). L’impact des bourbes sur la fermentation alcoolique a été évalué en menant une expérimentation à l’échelle laboratoire en fermenteurs de 1 L. Des particules solides issues des différentes bourbes étudiées ont été rajoutées à un moût synthétique (mimant un moût de vinification en blanc) de façon à obtenir pour chaque modalité une teneur standardisée à 1 mg/L en phytostérols. Un témoin (moût synthétique sans particules ajoutées) a également été réalisé. La turbidité des moûts contenant 1 mg de phytosérols/L varie de 14 à 38 NTU. Les résultats de la fermentation expérimentale montrent que la teneur initiale en phytostérols du moût de raisin est un facteur clé de la fermentation alcoolique. En effet, en situation où les phytostérols sont le facteur limitant de la fermentation alcoolique, leur présence augmente fortement la population de levures et la vitesse de production du CO2. Cet effet positif peut s’expliquer par le fait que les phytostérols améliorent l’assimilation de l’azote par les levures. Une deuxième expérimentation a mis en évidence que i) l’assimilation de l’azote par la levure augmente tant que les phytostérols sont le facteur limitant ii) la quantité d’azote assimilé dépend de la souche de levure utilisée. En vinification en blanc ou en rosé, une concentration optimisée de particules reste donc nécessaire pour une assimilation complète de l’azote par les levures. Plus la teneur en azote assimilable du moût est élevée, plus la quantité de lipides nécessaire aux levures pour permettre l’assimilation de la totalité de l’azote est élevée. Ces résultats montrent bien l’importance de l’équilibre entre ces 2 nutriments clés pour le contrôle de la fermentation en vinification en phase liquide clarifiée.",['sdv']
The geomorphology of the Makran Trench in the context of the geological and geophysical settings of the Arabian Sea,"The study focuses on the Makran Trench in the Arabian Sea basin, in the north Indian Ocean. The area is tectonically active, with a system of ridges and fracture zones morphologically separating the Arabian Sea. The study examined the relationships between the topographic structure of the Makran Trench and the regional settings of the Arabian Sea: geomorphology, sediment thickness, geophysical fields, geology and tectonic lineaments. The methodology is based on the GMT scripting toolset. The spatial analysis includes high-resolution datasets GEBCO, EGM2008, GlobSed and data on tectonics, geology, geophysics, sediment thickness and topographic terrain model visualized by GMT. The paper also defined a way in which the proprietary ESRI data format can be transformed into the freely available GMT geospatial data of the geoid EGM2008 model. The geo-morphological modeling included the automatic digitization of 300-km width cross-section profiles of the trench demonstrating its submarine relief. The analysis showed a correlation between the geological and tectonic structures , asymmetric geomorphology and geophysical anomaly fields. Gravity data indicate a crustal structure with anomalies generated by the bending of the lithosphere into the Makran subduction zone and density variations in the mantle reflected on the gravity maps. The gravity correlates with lineaments of the geomorphic structures. Bathymetric analysis revealed the most frequent depth (448 samples) at −3,250 to −3,500 m, followed by intervals: −3,000 to −3,250 m, −2,750 to −3,000 m. The declining continental slope correlates with gradually decreasing depths as equally distributed bins: 124 samples (−2,500 to −2,750 m), 96 (−2,250 to −2,500 m), 86 (−2,000 to −2,250 m). The trench is an asymmetric form with a high steepness on the continental slope of Pakistan and low steepness with a flat valley on the oceanward side. The multi-source data integration is important for seafloor mapping and the geomorphological analysis of oceanic trenches hidden to direct observations. The machine learning methods of GMT and cartographic modeling provide possibilities for the effective visualization of the trench. The comparison of the geomorphology with gravity anomalies, tectonic lineation, geological structures and topographical variations provides more detail to studies of the seafloor in the Arabian Sea.","['info', 'sde', 'phys']"

Computer Vision viewing over Mathematics,"The difference between having images of something and having a knowledge of the same thing has been a subject of reflection for centuries, and some of the most important Greek tragedies focused on that point. A great part of infor-mation now consists of images: image has become the language of many people. Authors have already written on the necessity of learning how to read images. In this article the interest of learning how to write images will be experiment-ed in the context of Mathematics Teaching. Our experiments have taken place in the Electrical Engineering and Com-puter Science Department of the Institute of Technology of Valenciennes. Different kinds of students have been con-cerned aged from 15 until 25, in different circumstances: Festival of Science, Mathematics lectures or more specialized courses on Robotics and Vision.

HOW ROBOTICS VISION AND COMPUTER VISION IMPROVE INTERDISCIPLINARITY,"Since a decade, the academic syllabus for bachelors in Electrical Engineering domain is reserving a wide area for projects. The projects represent about ten percent of the final marks for the diploma validation after two years courses in theoretical, technical domains and its applications. The objectives are to make students more sensitive to the mixed knowledge, to manage a group rather rather giving academic lessons. In any case, one success element of the project is laying on two facts always checked. First, the choice of the project by the students themselves and second the total availability of the teacher manager. Such an alike behaviour can be found in the purchase decision discussed by J. Dewey one hundred years ago meaning that good ideas are out of age. Twenty years ago, the academic program of mathematics proposed to use a computer algebraic program in order to free all attendees from hard calculation. It was the starts of the DARE method still in use. It holds three major steps where the last step deals with the modelling of any electrical engineering problem. To be closer to the problem, mathematics authors had to discuss, adapt and share their teachings thus discover other teachings ways according to the concerned domain. That launched for years the collaborative work within sciences and applied sciences. The discussion mixing teachers of different domains in front of students make them pointing out the interest for the proposed subject. A showroom includes all current and past projects. The first and ambitious project was to build a line tracker robot. Everything in electrical engineering from electronics to computer science and mathematics has been installed inside. The project took two years. Twelve students in bachelor of technology worked hard in order to compete in a place in the middle of France for a special challenge. The too sophisticated robot has been changed in another one based on Lego bricks offering more possibilities, easy programming languages and freeing the students of technical and time consuming aspects. This has been used during many years and still now for projects, international projects and also for a one week devoted to open scholars to the sciences and the technology. In that background all staff members had been enrolled. The role played by the mathematics teachers was to organize, manage, check the results, refresh the motivation relayed by their colleagues. Later and thank to a student idea, a new and sophisticated project got up as a bachelor of technology course was launched in the sustainable development with new equipment as solar panels, wind power and water station. The opportunity was to design an autonomous robot taking advantages of modern elements as micro controllers, microprocessors, cheap actuators and servo motors easy to program. But a new direction for projects has been taken since five years. Based on a small, cheap and easy to program computer, it offers a tool for doing experiments at home in electronics, computer science and also mathematics and vision. Coming an attractive subject for students, the computer vision followed by the image processing is now rising in all minds. First in projects for a student coming from abroad to validate their practical course in engineering, the computer vision interest is growing up for local students. And second on a computer vision course designed to mix mathematics, computer science and image processing. The method is laying on the DARE method mentioned above.",['info']
ACTIVE LEARNING BY VIRTUAL PROTOTYPING TECHNIQUE,"In this paper, the development of virtual prototypes models and their testing for active learning support is described. The personalized virtual applications selected by a tutor are used directly for performing active learning at the university's separated workplace.

On-line learning outcomes materials, as virtual prototypes, were created and tested on the desktop environment. Some of them were also investigated as the ""active elements"" for active learning, especially for writing stage rapports including practical projects. The practice showed that the testing of issues such as the practical stage work can result in an active learning process.

A ROBOTICS EXPERIENCE WITH MOOC,"Since a couple of decades, authors are running towards the vanishing student motivations. They have applied a large amount of teaching tools or methods as the slide rule, overhead projector, programmable calculator, software, internet, moodle and supervised projects. Project based learning is one of them. Initially used in an Erasmus background, that is placement in a foreign partner university for three months, the project based learning technique is now applied in projects supervised by local teachers. The main goal is to increase the autonomy of students. The paper deals with one project in connection with robotics and using the modern MOOC technique. The term MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Course. A free access to the course is done by the internet. At the Valenciennes Institute of Technology, some supervised projects are focusing on electronics, process control, physics, maths or electrotechnics applied to robotics. The Lego Mindstorms NXT or an homemade solar tracker rover or the French NAO humanoid make up the working platforms. Every use of any platform should gather and apply the knowledge of the previous domains. The students have to balance their mind from theory to application. Mainly, they should identify the required knowledge, and thus learn it, understand it and apply it by their own. As working alone seems a challenge, the difficulty can be fixed by the reverse learning technique. In particular the Massive Online Open Course, MOOC in short offers a new way to make students more autonomous. One example of a recent MOOC experiment given here has been done in the robotics framework. It proposes first to work in a theoretical domain laying on hard sciences then to apply the new concepts using a Matlab software or building and programming a Lego object by the way an intelligent arm. The MOOC concerns here over ten thousand worldwide participants. In the Institute of Technology, two groups have been formed for the MOOC. A local one is composed of six students from first year course in Electrical Engineering domain. Four Finnish students in second grade in Information Technology course form the second group. Their three months stay in France has been possible thanks to the Erasmus+ students exchange. In France, the students have been working and supervising weekly by teachers in Maths, Mechanics, Control and English language all the MOOC long. In Finland students worked by their own. The positive behaviour of students working in total autonomy is significant for the first module. The second module is requiring closer help by local supervisors. A final survey given to the students after the last session confirms the teachers feeling. This experiment should be renewed next academic year.",['info']
A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CLIENT-SERVER PLATFORM,"The academic syllabus of the Electrical Enginering and industrial data processing taught inside the french Institutes of Technology offers a course called Industrial Ethernet and remote control with the internet.

As a pedagogical support, the Spykee robot platform is used for two main reasons. First, its possibilities are matching the previous objectives. Then, as it is a regional product, that implies the maintenance and improvements can be effective with a short delay. The robot can be used at different levels of applications with respect to the user's basic knowledge. The paper deals with the main applications done with the multidisciplinary platform. One application is based on the DARE method, acronym for Discovering, Applying and REsolving which has been used for ten years in the Electrical Enginering department. A second example presents an international robotics competition with academic partners.

The advertising-financed business model in two-sided media markets,"This chapter focuses on the economic mechanisms at work in recent models of advertising finance in media markets developed around the concept of two-sided markets. The objective is to highlight new and original insights from this approach, and to clarify the conceptual aspects. The chapter first develops a canonical model of two-sided markets for advertising, where platforms deliver content to consumers and resell their “attention” to advertisers. A key distinction is drawn between free media and pay media, where the former result from the combination of valuable consumer attention and low ad-nuisance cost. The first part discusses various conceptual issues such as equilibrium concepts and the nature of inefficiencies in advertising markets, and concrete issues such as congestion and second-degree discrimination. The second part is devoted to recent contributions on issues arising when consumers patronize multiple platforms. In this case, platforms can only charge incremental values to advertisers, which reduce their market power and affect their price strategies and advertising levels. The last part discusses the implications of the two-sided nature of the media markets for the choice of content and diversity.",['shs']

We also aimed to validate the method as a relevant eco-driving teaching tool that does not distract drivers or affect safety behaviour. We examined the contribution of the guidance system to teach procedural skills compared with traditional teaching methods such as video instruction.

Fracture toughness of glasses and hydroxyapatite: a comparative study of 7 methods by using Vickers indenter,"Numerous methods have been proposed to estimate the indentation fracture toughness Kic for brittle materials. These methods generally uses formulæ established from empirical correlations between critical applied force, or average crack length, and classical fracture mechanics tests. This study compares several models of fracture toughness calculation obtained by using Vickers indenters. Two optical glasses (Crown and Flint), one vitroceramic (Zerodur) and one ceramic (hydroxyapatite) are tested. Fracture toughness and hardness are obtained by using instrumented Vickers indentation at micrometer scale. Young's moduli are obtained by instrumented Berkovich indentation at nanometer scale. Fracture toughness is calculated with models involving crack length measurements, and by models free of crack length measurements by considering critical force, chipping, pop-in. Finally, method based on the cracking energy, commonly employed for coated materials is also used. The aim of this work is to compare seven methods, which enable the facture toughness determination, on four brittle materials. To do so, it was necessary to determine some specific constant in the case of Vickers tip use. On the one hand, results show that methods using crack length, critical force, edge chipping or pop-in lead to comparable results, and the advantages and drawbacks are highlighted. On the other hand, the indentation energy method leads to underestimated results of about 20%.","['spi', 'phys']"
Observation of direct-photon collective flow in sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV Au+Au collisions,"The second Fourier component v_2 of the azimuthal anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane was measured for direct photons at midrapidity and transverse momentum (p_T) of 1--13 GeV/c in Au+Au collisions at sqr(s_NN)=200 GeV. Previous measurements of this quantity for hadrons with p_T < 6 GeV/c indicate that the medium behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, while for p_T > 6 GeV/c a reduced anisotropy is interpreted in terms of a path-length dependence for parton energy loss. In this measurement with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider we find that for p_T > 4 GeV/c the anisotropy for direct photons is consistent with zero, as expected if the dominant source of direct photons is initial hard scattering. However, in the p_T < 4 GeV/c region dominated by thermal photons, we find a substantial direct photon v_2 comparable to that of hadrons, whereas model calculations for thermal photons in this kinematic region significantly underpredict the observed v_2.",['phys']
A METHOD TO CONNECT MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCES USING A COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEM,"The paper presents an experience driven over twenty years in an Institute of Technology. The two first authors are mathematicians, the third one is teaching automatic control and the last is a specialist in digital electronics. The authors have worked, discussed and shared their common teaching experience on how to restore the vanishing student motivation mainly due to the running and efficient technology. As the powerful software in any domain are getting higher, their use in education seem unavoidable. The paper deals with the use of a computer algebra system in a closed connection and applications to the above scientific domains. A computer algebra system is a software that eases the calculation in a way closed to the same as hand calculation. They are used in mathematics and sciences. Their main features are given in the following. A user friendly interface eases the symbolic manipulations. All numerical operations can be done in an arbitrary-precision. The sketch of curves and surfaces is possible in any representation mode. Some systems offers more features first in additional library then included later in the software after users comments and feedback. For a pedagogical purpose, the well-built on line help is one of the first criterion to choose a computer algebra system rather another one. Nowadays, in higher education, the curriculum of some course includes their natural use in mathematics classrooms. To make mathematics more attractive, to apply them to different technologies and to do an effective scientific work with pleasure, the authors have adjusted a method that has proved its efficiency for many years. The method is based on the use of a computer algebra system. The paper details this new method. The method is illustrated by three examples in different domains. The method is now denoted as the DARe method. It holds three major steps. The first one called Discovering is devoted to a direct use of the computer algebraic software to measure its effect in the mathematical background. The second point is called Applying. It focuses on the way to translate the mathematical information in the specific language of the software. The last point called Resolving is mixing the practical acquired knowledge in order to model and solve a scientific problem by the use of the computer algebraic software. The public concerned with the method is composed of groups of twelve students in the bachelor of technology domain with electrical engineering as speciality. The syllabus is proposing about fifty hours of practical mathematical works. About one thousand students have applied this method. Thanks to their direct comments, discussions and answers to a final questionnaire, the method has been improved since many years. The last release is presented here through some examples taken from automatic control and electronics. Even if the last step, of the method, ""to model a problem "", is rising up the difficulties, the students mention that they are doing rather listening mathematics. The computer algebraic system free them of calculus and prevent them from errors. The three steps method has been applied with success in a computer science course. It is also extended for experiments to other subjects such as robotics, electronics and mechanics.",['math']
Impacts of Human Mobility in Mobile Data Offloading,"Due to the limited coverage of WiFi APs, users' mobility has a severe impact on the performance of mobile offloading systems. The present study is a contribution in this context as offloading zones are identified and characterized from individual GPS trajectories when small offloading time windows are considered. The results show that (i) attending to users mobility, ten seconds is the minimum offloading time window that can be considered; (ii) offloading predictive methods can have variable performance according to the period of the day; and (iii) per-user opportunistic decision models can determine offloading system design and performance.",['info']
Necessary Conditions for Implicit and DAE Control Systems,"Necessary conditions for optimal control problems involving implicit control systems and with possible nonsmooth data has been derived under bounded slope conditions in [1]. Here, we investigate how such conditions apply to various particular cases of implicit control systems. In particular, we extend the analysis in [3], where application to some optimal control problems with semi-explicit Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE's) are explored. Noteworthy, we consider DAE's systems with index higher then 1. We go a step further and we extend necessary conditions for mixed constrained problem derived in [3] under interiority conditions and convexity of the velocity sets can to cover implicit control systems.",['math']
DRMSim: A Routing-Model Simulator for Large-Scale Networks,"The expansion of Internet topology, which comprises thousands of Autonomous Systems (AS), has resulted in a number of important research challenges. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to make core routing decisions on the Internet, starts to show its limitations in terms of the number of routing table entries it can store locally, update in a timely fashion and dynamically exchange. Because it is impractical to deploy newly designed routing protocols on the Internet a large-scale, simulation is an unavoidable step to validate their properties. However, the increasing routing information processing (CPU) and storage (memory) introduces similar challenges for the simulation of state-full routing. For this purpose, we introduce DRMSim a Dynamic Routing Model simulator of routing models on large-scale networks.",['info']
Built on Sand,"Granular media—composed of vast amounts of grains, consolidated or not—constitute the most abundant form of solid matter on Earth. Granular materials assemble in disordered configurations scientists often liken to a bag of marbles. Made of macroscopic particles rather than molecules, they defy the standard scheme of classification in terms of solid, liquid, and gas. Granular materials provide a model relevant to various domains of research, including engineering, physics, and biology. William Blake famously wished “To See a World in a Grain of Sand”; in this book, pioneering researchers in granular matter explain the science hidden behind simple grains, shedding light on collective behavior in disordered settings in general. The authors begin by describing the single grain with its different origins, shapes, and sizes, then examine grains in piled or stacked form. They explain the packing fraction of granular media, a crucial issue that bears on the properties displayed in practical applications; explore small-scale deformations in piles of disordered grains, with particular attention to friction; and present theories of various modes of disorder. Along the way, they discuss such concepts as force chains, arching effects, wet grains, sticky contacts, and inertial effects. Drawing on recent numerical simulations as well as classical concepts developed in physics and mechanics, the book offers an accessible introduction to a rapidly developing field.","['spi', 'phys']"

Simulation based optimization approach to solve a maintenance process problem,"In this paper, a simulation based optimization method is introduced. A combined simulation and Non Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) optimization engine is developed to solve a maintenance process problem for an industrial case. The coupling is used in order to optimize the performances of the simulation model representing a maintenance process by choosing the best queues' scheduling policy. Our simulation model is performed using FLEXSIM software. NSGA-II model is implemented using C# language, because it ensures exchanges between FLEXSIM software and Ms Excel. The NSGA-II and simulation models operate in parallel over time with interactions. The aim of this paper is to propose an original approach for reorganizing the maintenance process using simulation based optimization approaches.",['spi']

Protein reactivity with singlet oxygen: Influence of the solvent exposure of the reactive amino acid residues,"The singlet oxygen quenching rate constants were measured for three model proteins, bovine serum albumin, β-lactoglobulin and lysozyme. The results were analyzed by comparing them with the corresponding singlet oxygen quenching rate constants for a series of tripeptides with the basic formula GlyAAGly where the central amino acid (AA) was the oxidizable amino acid, tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine and histidine. It was found that the reaction rate constant in proteins can be satisfactorily modelled by the sum of the individual contributions of the oxidizable AA residues corrected for the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) effects. The best results were obtained when the SASA of the AA residues were determined by averaging over molecular dynamics simulated trajectories of the proteins. The limits of this geometrical correction of the AA residue reactivity are also discussed.",['chim']
Dynamic recrystallization behaviour of spheroidal graphite iron. Application to cutting operations,"To increase the competitiveness of manufacturing processes, numerical approaches are unavoidable. Nevertheless, a precise knowledge of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the materials is necessary to simulate accurately these processes. Previous experimental studies have provided a limited information concerning dynamic recrystallization of spheroidal graphite iron under hot cutting operations. The purpose of this paper is to develop a constitutive model able to describe accurately the occurrence of this phenomenon. Compression tests are carried out using a Gleeble 3500 thermo-mechanical simulator to determine the hot deformation behaviour of spheroidal graphite iron at high strains. Once the activation range of the dynamic recrystallization process is assessed, a constitutive model taking into account this phenomenon is developed and implemented in the Abaqus/Explicit software. Finally, a specific cutting test and its finite element model are introduced. The ability of the numerical model to predict the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization is then compared to experimental observations.",['spi']

Multisensor Fault-Tolerant Automotive Control,"This chapter deals with the problem of obtaining fault-tolerant guarantees of a multi-sensor switching strategy for automotive control. It is assumed that each sensor (or a family of sensors) has an associated observer that performs a good estimation under normal operation conditions. In presence of sensor failures the related observer provides an estimation that is biased by signals (that often depend of the references). Since the automotive vehicle is modeled as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system by taken the vehicle speed as a scheduling parameter, the main problem concerns the computation of robustly positively invariant-sets for the state trajectories of the controlled system during fault-free operation. These invariant-sets could be used as bounds and/or thresholds for the residuals (here the tracking error estimations for instance) allowing to detect a sensor failure even in presence of nominal disturbances. The invariant-sets provide a support for fast faultdetection avoiding selecting faulty-sensors. Then, these invariant-sets together with a sensor switching mechanism allows to obtain fault-tolerant guarantees of the controlled system. Here, the proposed approach is applied for a vehicle lateral dynamics control.",['spi']
A methodology to obtain data at the slip-band scale from atomic force microscopy observations and crystal plasticity simulations.

From AFM measurements of slip bands emerging at the specimen surface during tensile loading, and from numerical results of strain fields at the grain scale, the method is able to determine at the local discrete scale the mean slip-band spacing and the number of dislocations emerging during the plastic strain. The methodology applied in the hydrogen embrittlement context highlights, quantitatively, at the grain scale an increased plastic strain localization with internal hydrogen.",['spi']
"Les Marocains au Canada : histoire, profil et enjeux","A la fin des années 1960, le Canada ouvre ses frontières à une immigration de plus en plus diversifiée et mène, depuis lors, une politique d'immigration permanente avec des chiffres allant de 200 000 à 250 000 admissions par année. Aujourd'hui, près de 20% des 33 millions d'habitants recensés au Canada sont nés à l'étranger. Depuis vingt ans, le nombre de migrants en provenance du Maghreb ne cesse d'augmenter, se dirigeant très majoritairement vers le Québec, la province qui bénéficie des plus importantes prérogatives en matière de sélection migratoire.

Il s'agit donc de faire le point sur l’histoire et le profil de l’immigration marocaine au Canada et de proposer quelques pistes de réflexion sur les enjeux spécifiques auxquels se confronte cette population, au Québec en particulier.",['shs']
Set-Membership Observer Design Based on Ellipsoidal Invariant Sets,"This paper presents a new set-membership observer design method for linear discrete-time systems. The real process is assumed to be perturbed by unknown but bounded disturbances. The set-membership observer provides a deterministic state interval that is build as the sum of the estimated system states and its corresponding estimation errors bounds. The proposed approach is based on the solutions of a few number of Linear Matrix Inequalities that are suitable modified to provide both the observer parameters and ellipsoidal Robustly Positive Invariant sets. The latter are used to frame the estimation error in a very simple and accurate way. The enhanced precision on the computation of the estimation error bounds has been possible thanks to the use of the a posteriori calculated covariance matrix that allows, in a second time, a more suitable description of the dissipation equation used in the Bounded-real lemma formulation. A numerical example illustrates the behavior of such observer and discuss its easy implementation",['spi']
3D Sketching for aesthetic design using Fully Free Form Deformation Features,"This paper addresses the designers’ activity and in particular the way designers express an object shape in 2D sketches through character lines and how these lines form a basis for sketching shapes in 3D. The tools currently available in commercial CAS/CAD systems to manipulate the digital models are still not sufficiently suited to support design. In this paper, the so-called fully free-form deformation features (d-F4) are introduced as a modelling method to take into account the curve-oriented stylists’ way of working. Both the advantages of a free-form surface deformation method and a feature-based approach are merged to define these high-level modelling entities allowing for a direct manipulation of surfaces through a limited number of intuitive parameters. Such features incorporate several characteristics designed to handle the uncertainties and/or inconsistencies of the designer’s input during a sketching activity. In addition, a d-F4 classification is proposed to enable a fast access to the desired shape according to its semantics and characteristics.","['info', 'spi']"
Estimation of the temperature field on a composite fan cowl using the static capacity of surface-mounted piezoceramic transducers,"The influence of temperature on SHM (Structural Health Monitoring) systems using guided waves is a major problem for their industrial deployment. One of the most used and cheapest SHM process developed in aeronautic context is based on piezoelectric transducers mounted on the monitored structure. Several methods are then used to assess the presence of damage. A popular one is based on tracking changes in the static capacity of the transducers: it is an efficient damage indicator in close area surrounding the device and is often used as a fault diagnosis of the transducer itself. However, monitoring decision are robustified with temperature sensors also mounted on the structure, adding wires and signal processing post-treatments. In this article, the static capacity is used to determine the temperature on each lead zirconate titanate transducer (PZT). By imparting this additional functionality to PZT devices, supplementary instrumentation is not necessary and an estimation of the entire temperature field of the structure is obtained. The original proposed approach is tested experimentally on a on a small composite plate and then on a large real part of an A380 composite nacelle. The results show that the temperature field on the structure can be estimated with a precision of ±5 °C using a linear regression between static capacity and temperature",['spi']
Garden cities: a model for healthy cities,"To face the increasing housing demand, and to solve health problems related to the current city lifestyle (such as obesity, cancer and stress-related diseases), British government initiatives support the creation of new communities based on garden cities principles. They consider the garden cities utopia as a breakdown in previous trends and practices and as an alternative to the present urban and suburban models. In order to achieve a more appropriate model for an urban planning change, and to avoid using the word ‘garden’ as a convenient label, an analysis on the garden cities utopia in the 21th century is needed. In this paper, the focus will be on the project of a new garden city based in Ebbsfleet, UK (Ebbsfleet Garden City). This case study is ideal for understanding whether the garden cities model might be an answer to the challenges of today’s health issues and might push cities to provide a more attractive living environment, promoting an active sustainable and healthy lifestyle.",['shs']
Erosion influence the seismicity of active thrust faults,"Assessing seismic hazards remains one of the most challenging scientific issue in Earth sciences. Deep tectonic processes are classically considered as the only persistent mechanism driving the stress loading of active faults over a seismic cycle. Here we show with a mechanical model that erosion also significantly influences the stress loading of thrust faults at the timescale of a seismic cycle. Indeed, erosion rates of about 0.1 to 20 mm/yr, as documented in Taiwan and in other active compressional orogens, can raise the Coulomb stress by 0.1 to 10 bar on the nearby thrust faults over the inter-seismic phase. Mass transfers induced by surface processes in general, during continuous or short-lived and intense events, represent a prominent mechanism for inter-seismic stress loading of faults near the surface. Such stresses are probably sufficient to promote the rupture of deep continental earthquakes up to the surface or to trigger shallow seismicity. We illustrate this last point by identifying seismic events in Taiwan, by the mean of a coupled statistical and mechanical approach, that were induced by intense erosional events.",['phys']
A crystal plasticity based approach for the modelling of high cycle fatigue damage in metallic materials,"In this paper, a polycrystalline model is proposed to describe the fatigue behaviour of metallic materials in the high cycle fatigue regime. The model is based on a multiscale approach, which allows the connection of local deformation and damage mechanisms to macroscopic behaviour. To consider the anisotropy of plastic properties, the constitutive model is developed at the grain scale within a crystal plasticity framework. A phenomenological approach, which requires the introduction of a damage variable for each slip system, is used to account for the anisotropic nature of damage. The constitutive model is then integrated within a self-consistent formulation to consider the polycrystalline nature of metallic materials. Finally, the proposed model is used to describe the high cycle fatigue behaviour of a medium carbon steel (0.35% C). With a proper adjustment of material parameters, the model is capable of correctly reproducing fatigue test results, even for complex loading conditions (multiaxial, non-proportional). According to the model, damage is found to be highly localized in some specific grains. Also, while fatigue damage results in a progressive decrease in elastic stiffness at the crystal scale, the elastic properties are not significantly affected at the macroscopic scale. The model is used to study the correlation and fatigue damage. According to the numerical results, no evident correlation between fatigue damage and energy dissipation is observed.",['spi']

Designing a quasi-spherical module for a huge modular robot to create programmable matter,"There are many ways to implement programmable matter. One is to build it as a huge modular self-reconfigurable robot composed of a large set of spherical micro-robots, like in the Claytronics project. These micro-robots must be able to stick to each other and move around each other. However, the shape of these micro-robots has not been studied yet and remains a difficult problem as there are numerous constraints to respect. In this article, we propose a quasi-spherical structure for these micro-robots, which answers all the constraints for building programmable matter, helping the realization of an interactive computer-aided design framework. We study different scenarios, validate the ability to move and propose methods for manufacturing these micro-robots.",['info']

Meeting digital challenges in the sector,"The wine industry—like all business sectors —has undergone a digital revolution. This transformation has provided a unique opportunity for stakeholders in this sector to benefit from very high definition information and thus enhance monitoring and management of their production systems. New technologies have led to a marked increase in data that can be acquired through wireless sensor networks or weather stations, machine-mounted or hand-held data logging systems, and remote-sensing platforms (unmanned aerial vehicules, airborne devices, satellites). Data concerning vines and the vineyard environment (climate, soil, etc.), as well as wine processing, making and marketing processes, are acquired at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. This generates very high flows of diverse data which have to be processed, analysed, shared, disseminated and stored prior to their use and development. An incredible wealth of high volume data is now available, which could serve to design very effective decision support tools for the wine industry , provided professionals have access to tailored methods to develop their products in response to market trends and climate change. These methods must meet a dual challenge. First, all upstream (agricultural and environmental) and downstream (transformation processes, consumption patterns, etc.) data must be linked via advanced data integration techniques, knowledge (disciplinary or business related) and models. Secondly, knowledge must be extracted from data by modelling and/or by inference on phenomena whose complexity has until now been hard to grasp. The tools and methods developed will facilitate assessment and management of new systems while ensuring the sustainability of the sector through an integrative approach. They will meet needs with regard to representation, diagnosis, assessment and decision support for various issues, including crop protection, environmental assessment, input management, product quality management, etc. New complex system design methods will also be proposed for innovations in, for instance, equipment sizing and types, while developing new cropping systems, breeding new varieties adapted to new constraints, and capturing new market shares. The Agropolis scientific community has the expertise and facilities necessary to come up with effective responses to the major challenges of the digital revolution. They raise research issues for the entire viticulture and wine sector at organizational, spatial and temporal scales. Several research units are aware of the importance of digital challenges in the fields of agronomy and environment. They hence focus their methodological research—in collaboration with their national and international, public and private partners—on addressing the challenges that arise. The fact that specialized engineering science, mathematics and informatics research units, as well as thematic research units in viticulture, ecophysiology, oenology, etc., are pooled within Agropolis promotes interdisciplinarity and is a prime asset. A first type of research concerns issues associated with measurements obtained via automated or manual recording devices. They encompass the design of: i) new sensors, ii) methods to ensure data quality, and iii) innovative systems for organizing and sharing information. A second type of research deals with specific issues related to the influx of geolocalized data in the precision viticulture framework, e.g. the design of spatial data sampling and processing methods that take wine trade knowledge into account. Finally, the last type brings together research in different areas: i) the analysis of huge volumes of heterogeneous data (spatiotemporal) collected in vineyards or wine cellars, ii) data- and knowledge-based modelling, and iii) simulation-based modelling. A major share of the research conducted by the community in all of the fields presented in this chapter concerns the effective use of data via simulation and decision-support software packages, which are essential for identifying new uses and implementing innovative practices.","['info', 'math']"
Prédire la qualité des viandes: mythe ou réalité ?,"This review was aimed at providing an overview of recent advancements obtained in the field of meat quality prediction. The different methods used in the production sectors for the development of equations and the tools used based on different types of biological markers (genomic or phenotypic) or physical (spectroscopy) are discussed. Through the different examples that are presented, it appears that the identification of biological markers is confronted with the complex determinism of quality parameters. This makes the development of generic molecular tests to be used on the field even more difficult. However, in recent years, progress has been made, benefitting from genomics, proteomics and metabolomics technological developments. The first equations that predict the sensorial quality and the technological potential of meat hint to possible applications in the near future. Concerning spectroscopy, the main results were obtained using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) with developments obtained for the prediction of the composition and nutritional value of meats. The prediction of the technological potential of meats using this method and mainly the sensorial quality is, however, more difficult. Finally, the example of the MSA (« Meat Standards Australia ») phenotypic model which predicts the sensorial quality of bovine meat based on a combination of upstream and downstream data and whose added-value for the sector has been identified in Australia, presents a genericness that has already been proven in several countries.Cette revue a pour objectif de faire un point sur les avancées récentes obtenues dans le domaine de la prédiction de la qualité des viandes. Elle aborde différentes démarches menées au sein des principales filières de production pour développer des équations puis des outils prédictifs basés sur différents types de marqueurs biologiques (génomiques ou phénotypiques) ou physiques (spectroscopiques). Au travers des différents exemples présentés, il apparaît que l’identification de marqueurs biologiques se confronte au déterminisme complexe des paramètres de qualité qui rend encore difficile la mise au point de tests moléculaires génériques utilisables sur le terrain. Toutefois, les avancées ont été notables ces dernières années bénéficiant des récents développements technologiques en génomique, protéomique et métabolomique. Les premières équations de prédiction de la qualité sensorielle et du potentiel technologique des viandes laissent entrevoir des possibilités d’applications dans les années à venir. Concernant la spectroscopie, les principaux résultats ont été obtenus dans le domaine de la Spectroscopie Proche Infrarouge (SPIR) avec des développements aboutis pour prédire la composition et la valeur nutritionnelle des viandes. La prédiction du potentiel technologique des viandes à l’aide de cette méthode et surtout de la qualité sensorielle est en revanche plus difficile. Enfin, l’exemple du modèle phénotypique MSA (« Meat Standards Australia ») de prévision de la qualité sensorielle de la viande bovine basée sur une combinaison de données d’amont et d’aval et dont la plus-value pour la filière a été démontrée en Australie, présente une généricité qui a déjà été éprouvée dans plusieurs pays.",['sdv']

"Abnormal patterns of resumption of cyclicity after calving in Holstein cows: risk factors,relationships with the ultrasound appearance of the ovaries and with gestation failure after AI","Twice weekly blood progesterone analysis was used to monitor resumption of ovarian cyclicity in 239 postpartum periods of 144 Holstein cows in one herd between D7 and D70 postpartum (PP). Calving season, low milk production and low BCS were risk factors for delayed cyclicity (DC: 16.3%). Retained placenta and metritis, early ovulation after calving and postpartum negative energy balance were identified as risk factors for prolonged luteal phase (PLP: 18.4%). At the same time, in 110 postpartum periods, ovaries were examined twice a week by ultrasonography. In normal cows (N: 56.5%), the first large follicle (>= 10mm) appeared 14.6 +/- 3.9 days after calving, ovulation occurred 28.9 +/- 9.5 days PP and the maximum diameter of the first corpus luteum (CL) was 24.9 +/- 4.9 mm. In DC cows, the interval between calving to the first large follicle tended to be longer than in normal cows (23.0 +/- 15.6 d; P=0.06). In PLP cows, the first large follicle was delayed (17.6 +/- 5.2 d, P<0.05), first ovulation occurred earlier (23.2 +/- 6.9 d PP, P<0.05), the maximum size of the first CL was not different from N cows (26.2 +/- 6.2 mm) despite its lifespan (33.6 +/- 13.8 days). Before first AI, cows not seen in oestrus or with a diagnosed abnormal progesterone profile were submitted to oestrus induction and synchronization treatment. The proportions of treated cows were 32.8, 62.9 and 60.5% in the N, DC and PLP groups of cows (significant difference between N and abnormal cows). In N cows, the interval from calving to conception was 117.3 +/- 60.6 days. Conception rate at first service (CR) was 31.3%, the incidences of early embryonic (EEM) and late embryonic-foetal mortality (LEM) were 47.9 and 33.3%. In DC cows, calving to conception interval was higher (144.0 +/- 67.3 d, P<0.05) than N cows. CR (28.6%) and EEM (60%) incidence were not different from N cows. In PLP cows, calving to conception interval was not different (132.8 +/- 62.0 d), CR was lower (16.3%, P=0.05) and LEM incidence tended lobe higher (56.3%. P<0.10) than in N cows. In conclusion, transrectal ultrasonography is not effective in distinguishing normal CL from CL associated with a prolonged luteal phase. PLP seems to have a negative effect on CR and on the incidence of LEM which should be investigated on a larger scale in Holstein cows.",['sdv']
Dehydrated pelleted sainfoin for the growing rabbit: first results from intake and growth test,"Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) could be a good alternative to alfalfa for rabbit since it contains high ADF and ADL levels associated with a high level of protein.

Thus we designed two assays to evaluate the intake and growth of rabbit fed DpS (6 mm diameter, 15-23 mm length, hardness= 93 Mpa, crude protein=17.2%, ADF=30.4%, ADL=12.0%) as a sole feed (trial 1), or in free choice (trial 2) with commercial pelleted feed (CpF: 4 mm diam., 9-12 mm length, hardness = 6.5 Mpa, crude protein=15.9%, ADF=18.0, ADL=5.5%), and compared to a control group fed only the CpF. In trial 1, 2 groups of 30 rabbits (weaned at 39 d old) were housed in 2×6 cages, and fed freely either the DpS or the CpF, till 73 d old. In trial 2 (39-73 d old) one group of 96 rabbits (16 cages of 6) was fed freely the DpS and the CpF (in two separate feeders) and was compared to a control group (n=48, 8 cages of 6) fed the CpF only. Among the two trials, no health problems were detected on the animals. In trial 1, DpS intake reached 85.7 g/d (39-63 d period) and was similar to the intake of the control group (84.3 g/d; P>0.15). Although the DpS size and hardness was much higher than for CpF, the palatability of DpS was very high, since during the first week after weaning the intake was 78.5 g/d fo DpS, and 69.7 g/d for CpF (P<0.05). Growth of rabbit fed only DpS reached 18.5 g/d (39-73 d) and was logically lower than in control group (31.2 g/d, P<0.001). In trial 2 (39-73 d old) on a free choice basis rabbits ate 30% of DpS and 70% of CpF. The whole feed intake (DpS+CpF) was 23% higher than that of control (116.3 vs 94.2 g/d, P<0.05) and the rabbit growth was higher (34.6 vs 30.6, P<0.05). Thus dehydrated pelleted sainfoin seemed to be a good alternative to alfalfa as a fibre and protein source for the growing rabbit.",['sdv']
Bi-text Topography and Quantitative Approaches of Parallel Text Processing,"This paper presents a series of experiments devoted to the development of new tools for multilingual textometric exploration of translation corpora. I propose to use bi-text topography to facilitate the study of lexical equivalences on a quantitative basis. The map of parallel sections allows for the visualization of the corpus cut into corresponding sections by raising one (or several) characters to the rank of parallel section delimiters. The exploratory results show that the use of quantitative methods (characteristic elements computation, repeated segments extraction, multiple co-occurrences, etc.) in combination with bi-text topography offers new means for automatic description of lexical equivalences in translation corpora. The suggested approach opens up new horizons for interactive exploration of translation resources of multilingual texts in a variety of fields of study: translation, foreign language learning and teaching, bilingual terminology, lexicography, etc.",['shs']

Diversité des agricultures : des recherches pour des agricultures diverses et/ou une question pour la recherche,"After presenting the major issues of the diversity of agri-food systems, this chapter provides a summary of the findings on the diversity and its drivers in the various animal and plant sectors. Diversity would be more potential than effective in many sectors and areas. it would be particularly driven by demand from both agri-food industries and consumers ; depending on the situation, demand can be a barrier or a driver of diversity. The range of species, cultivars and breeds available and used is also decisive. Concerning the link between diversity and resilience of the systems, the analyses seem to pose it still more like an assumption than a substantiated result. This chapter concludes with the research questions to be explored in order to better understand the drivers of diversity to the benefit of the multiperformance of agri-food systems and the relations between diversity and resilience.Après avoir brossé les grands enjeux de la diversité des systèmes agri-alimentaires, ce chapitre introductif propose une synthèse des éléments de constat sur la diversité et ses drivers dans les différentes filières animales et végétales. La diversité serait plus potentielle que réelle dans de multiples filières et territoires. Celle-ci serait tout particulièrement pilotée par la demande, tant des transformateurs que des consommateurs ; selon les situations, celle-ci peut constituer un frein ou au contraire un driver de la diversité. La gamme d’espèces, de variétés et de races disponible et mobilisée est également déterminante. S’arrêtant sur le lien entre diversité et résilience des systèmes, les réflexions des groupes filières semblent plus le poser encore comme une hypothèse qu’il résultat étayé. Ce chapitre conclut sur les questions de recherche à explorer pour mieux appréhender les moteurs et les freins d’une diversité au service de la multiperformance de systèmes agri-alimentaires, et les relations entre diversité et résilience.",['sdv']
Une méthode pour évaluer conjointement performance environnementale et qualité globale des produits – Application aux filières vin et lait,"The capacity of consideration of the multi-performance (environmental, quality of products, economic) is a key factor of competitiveness of the agricultural sector and requires assessment method multi-criteria allowing the joint evaluation of these performances. The central objective of the project Qualenvic was to develop a methodology of multi-criteria evaluation (Contra Qualenvic) combining evaluation of the environmental performance and quality of products applied to two types of production: cow milk and wine. The method was applied on 30 dairy exploitations of Brittany and Cantal and on 20 vine technical management routes of the Val de Loire and Alsace. The environmental assessment was performed by the method of life cycle analysis adapted to each sector and the evaluation of the quality driven through a set of indicators specific to each product estimated and defined with groups of scientific and professional experts. The implemented method Contra Qualenvic on the set of our study cases showed all its potential in the possibility of identifying the technical practices or the exploitations presenting the best ""trade-off"" between environmental performance and quality of products. The method remains however to be adjusted by adapting in particular the system of evaluation and scoring which seems too severe at the moment, for example as the milk (milk and cheese) and quality of the grape.",['sdv']
"Structuration de la diversité génétique chez la luzerne cultivée, conséquence pour l'identification de gènes liés à des caractères agronomiques","La luzerne, espèce allogame et autotétraploïde, est une légumineuse fourragère dont l’intérêt connaît un renouveau certain grâce à ses atouts pour le développement durable de l’agriculture. L’amélioration des variétés nécessite de mieux connaître les ressources génétiques, pour les exploiter, que ce soit en sélection classique ou en utilisant les outils moléculaires pour implémenter la sélection assistée par marqueurs. En étudiant 10 variétés européennes, nous avons montré que la diversité à l’intérieur des variétés est grande (hétérozygotie attendue de 0.75, déviation standard de 0.80, pour des caractères phénotypiques et des marqueurs moléculaires neutres, respectivement). La différenciation entre variétés est notable pour les caractères phénotypiques. Cette structuration de la diversité est favorable à l’utilisation de la génétique d’association basée sur des gènes candidats pour identifier des gènes liés à des caractères agronomiques. Une telle étude a permis de montrer que le gène Constans-like contribue à expliquer les différences de longueur de tiges chez la luzerne, une composante du rendement fourrager. Alfalfa, an allogamous and autotetraploid species, is a forage legume for which a renewed interest has raised because of its advantages for a sustainable agriculture. Variety improvement requires a better knowledge of the genetic resources in order to exploit them, with classical breeding methods or with molecular tools to implement marker assisted selection. We have described 10 European varieties and found a large within-variety diversity (expected heterozygozity of 0.75, standard deviation of 0.80, with phenotypic traits and neutral molecular markers, respectively). Differentiation between varieties was noticeable for phenotypic traits. This genetic structure of diversity is favourable to the use of association genetics based on candidate genes to identify genes related to agronomic traits. Such a study showed that Constans-like gene contributes to explain differences in alfalfa stem length, a component of forage yield.",['sdv']
Co-conception et évaluation de scénarios agronomiques de réintroduction de légumineuses dans un territoire de Bourgogne,"Legume crops can help facing current environmental and food challenges, even if their areas have decreased since several decades. The aims of our study were (i) to design with local stakeholders agronomic scenarios of reintroduction of legumes into a French territory, (ii) to assess these scenarios ex ante, and (iii) to discuss with the stakeholders the interest and conditions of their adoption in the territory. The stakeholders involved were agricultural stakeholders (farmers, technical advisors), stakeholders from environmental organizations (water union, national park) and researchers The first step was the description and assessment of current and alternative crop management plans, from national statistical data and face-to-face surveys. In a second step, the current territory (crop distribution in the territory and cropping strategies) was described with local stakeholders, and was used as a reference. In a third step, stakeholders discussed various sets of objectives and constraints related to their territory. Among eight scenarios proposed by stakeholders, four scenarios were simulated with the tool used in the Coclick’eau approach. For each scenario, this tool optimizes an alternative distribution of crops and cropping strategies, and assesses the agronomic, socio-economic and environmental performances. Finally, the results were discussed with stakeholders.Les légumineuses peuvent contribuer à relever les défis environnementaux et alimentaires actuels, mais leurs surfaces cultivées ont largement diminué. Les objectifs de notre étude étaient (i) de concevoir, avec les acteurs locaux du Plateau Langrois (Bourgogne), des scénarios agronomiques de réintroduction de légumineuses, (ii) d'évaluer ex ante ces scénarios, et (iii) de discuter les conditions de leur mise en œuvre sur ce territoire. Les acteurs ayant participé étaient issus du monde agricole (agriculteurs, conseillers techniques), de l’environnement (syndicat d’eau, Parc National) et de la recherche. La première étape a consisté à décrire et évaluer les itinéraires techniques actuels et prospectifs à partir de données statistiques et de résultats d’enquêtes individuelles. Dans un second temps une représentation du territoire actuel (assolement de cultures et de façons de cultiver) a été construite avec les acteurs et nous a servi de point de référence. Les acteurs ont ensuite exprimé leurs attendus pour ce territoire. Parmi les huit pistes de scénarios ayant émergé, quatre ont fait l’objet d’une simulation avec l'outil Coclick'eau, qui optimise, pour chacun de ces scénarios, un assolement alternatif et calcule ses performances agronomiques, socio-économiques et environnementales. Finalement, ces résultats ont été présentés et discutés avec les acteurs.",['sdv']
"Diversité des agricultures – le cas des filières céréales, oléagineux et légumineuses à graines","The objective of this article is to describe, without being exhaustive, the diversity of agriculture through examples of cropping systems and cultural practices, for metropolitan France and for three crop production sectors: cereals, oilseeds and legumes. The analysis of the diversity reveals ways of diversification of technical systems and cultural practices, that are strongly dependent on the diversity of added values of the sectors. With a few notable exceptions, the recommendations on the practices are vast enough to allow a diversity of cropping and farming systems, once the technological criteria of the sector have been met. Then, it is worth considering the weighting allocated to these technological criteria on the technical choices of the farmers. It also seems necessary to question the value given to the diversity by the various actors, from farmers to consumers, by estimating, in particular, the economic performance of the most diversified agricultural systems as well as the levers to increase the performances of a diversified agriculture. To strengthen resilience, it seems necessary to widen the core of knowledge on which the actors can devise new forms of diversity and to open the debate on the agricultural diversity.L’objectif de cet article est de décrire, sans être exhaustif, la diversité des agricultures en mobilisant des exemples au niveau du système technique et des pratiques culturales, pour la France métropolitaine et pour trois filières : les céréales, les oléagineux et les légumineuses à graines. L’analyse de la diversité des agricultures montre que des voies de diversification des systèmes techniques et des pratiques culturales existent, mais que celles-ci sont fortement dépendantes de la diversité des voies de valorisation dans les filières. Au sein de ces dispositifs de valorisation, hormis quelques dispositifs spécifiques, les recommandations sur les pratiques sont suffisamment vastes pour permettre une diversité de systèmes de culture et de production, dès lors que les critères technologiques d’accès à la filière sont atteints. Il convient alors de s’interroger sur le poids de ces critères technologiques sur les choix techniques des agriculteurs. Il apparait également nécessaire de questionner la valeur donnée à la diversité par les différents acteurs des filières, de l’agriculteur au consommateur, en évaluant notamment la performance économique des systèmes agricoles les plus diversifiés ainsi que les leviers pour augmenter les performances d’une agriculture diversifiée. Il s’agit d’élargir le socle de connaissances sur lequel les acteurs pourront concevoir eux-mêmes de nouvelles formes de diversité et d’ouvrir le débat avec les acteurs des filières sur la préservation des formes de diversité des agricultures comme potentiel de résilience.",['sdv']
Caractérisation des dangers des contaminants alimentaires : ce qui change; conséquences pour la recherche et l’évaluation,"Despite major advances in molecular and cellular biology, systems biology and bioinformatics, toxicology applied to the risk assessment of chemicals and toxins has not changed significantly during the last decades. A radical conceptual and methodological change must emerge if a large number of chemicals or their combinations in mixtures need to be tested at a lower cost and quickly. The development and implementation of in vitro tools, recommended by international regulatory authorities, are essential steps in these changes. Toxicologists must now rely on the potential of systems biology, multiomics data integration and public databases to bridge the gap between initial molecular events and adverse effects at the level of a biological system and then an individual. In addition to proteomics and transcriptomics data capable of informing about potential changes in cell function and infrastructure, metabolomics approaches provide information about metabolite levels or flows of metabolites altered by toxic substances and can guide the selection of specific and sensitive early biomarkers for the subsequent development of high throughput screening. The analysis of big data and their modelling should make it possible to better predict the links between exposure to toxic substances and physiopathological conditions.En dépit de progrès majeurs en matière de biologie moléculaire et cellulaire, de biologie des systèmes et de bioinformatique, la toxicologie appliquée à l’évaluation du risque des substances chimiques et des toxines n'a pas beaucoup évolué au cours des dernières décennies. Un changement conceptuel et méthodologique radical doit émerger si l’on veut pouvoir tester à moindre coût et rapidement un grand nombre de produits chimiques, seuls ou en mélanges. Le développement et la mise en application d’outils in vitro, recommandés par les instances règlementaires internationales, sont des étapes essentielles de ces changements. Les toxicologues doivent désormais s’appuyer sur la biologie des systèmes, l'intégration de données multi-omiques et les bases de données publiques pour combler l'écart entre les événements moléculaires initialement repérés et les effets néfastes à l’échelle d’un système biologique, puis d’un individu. Outre les données de protéomique et de transcriptomique capables d’appréhender les changements moléculaires et cellulaires, les approches métabolomiques renseignent sur les niveaux de métabolites ou les flux de métabolites altérés par les toxiques et peuvent guider le choix de biomarqueurs précoces spécifiques et sensibles pour le développement ultérieur de dépistages haut débit. L’utilisation des données massives et leur modélisation devraient permettre de mieux prédire les liens entre exposition aux substances toxiques et états physiopathologiques.",['sdv']
Conception de systèmes de culture multiperformants à l'aide de modèles prédisant la nuisibilité et les services dépendant des adventices,"Weeds may be harmful for crop production but are essential for biodiversity conservation. In this project, we analysed and modelled the biophysical processes driving the effects of cultural techniques on weed flora and the latter's impact on crop production (e.g. yield loss, field infestation) and on other biotic components that are either beneficial (e.g. bees, birds) or harmful (e.g. the parasitic plant broomrape) for crop production. We developed and used tools and simulation methods to evaluate and design cropping systems that reconcile crop production, biodiversity and reduced herbicide use. Achieving a high performance for these three objectives was difficult though achieving it for two of them (production and biodiversity, or production and reduced herbicide use) was feasible.Les adventices (""mauvaises herbes"") peuvent être nuisibles pour la production agricole mais sont essentielles pour la biodiversité. Nous avons analysé et modélisé les processus biophysiques impliqués dans les effets des techniques culturales sur la flore adventice ainsi que l’impact des adventices sur la production agricole (ex. perte de rendement, « salissement » du champ) et sur les composantes biotiques bénéfiques (ex. abeilles) et nuisibles (ex. la plante parasite orobanche rameuse) pour la production agricole. Nous avons développé et utilisé des outils et méthodes de simulation pour évaluer et concevoir des systèmes de culture conciliant production agricole, biodiversité et réduction d'usage d'herbicide. Concilier un haut niveau de performances s'avère encore difficile pour ces trois objectifs mais faisable pour deux objectifs (production et biodiversité, ou production et réduction des herbicides).",['sdv']

Microscopic-macroscopic approach for binding energies with the Wigner-Kirkwood method. II. Deformed nuclei,"The binding energies of deformed even-even nuclei have been analysed within the framework of a recently proposed microscopic-macroscopic model. We have used the semiclassical Wigner - Kirkwood $\hbar$ expansion up to fourth - order, instead of the usual Strutinsky averaging scheme, to compute the shells corrections in a deformed Woods - Saxon potential including the spin-orbit contribution. For a large set of 561 even-even nuclei with $Z\ge 8$ and $N\ge 8$, we find an {\it rms} deviation from the experiment of 610 keV in binding energies, comparable to the one found for the same set of nuclei using the FRDM of Möller and Nix (656 keV). As applications of our model, we explore its predictive power near the proton and neutron drip lines as well as in the superheavy mass region. Next, we systematically explore the fourth - order Wigner - Kirkwood corrections to the smooth part of the energy. It is found that the ratio of the fourth - order to the second - order corrections behaves in a very regular manner as a function of the asymmetry parameter $I=(N-Z)/A$. This allows to absorb the fourth - order corrections into the second - order contributions to the binding energy, which enables to simplify and speed up the calculation of deformed nuclei.",['phys']

The nutritional cost of the immune response in pigs,"In growing animals, microbial challenges are associated with a decrease in feed intake and growth. Experimental data show that the slowing down of growth cannot be explained by the sole decrease in ingestion, suggesting that the immune response must be costly in nutrients. Immune defenses include maintenance of resting sentinel leukocytes and mucous barriers. Upon immune activation, mucosal epithelia are often dramatically challenged, haematopoiesis of innate immune cells is increased, lymphocytes undergo clonal expansions, and leukocytes metabolism increases to produce various effector responses (immunoglobulin synthesis, oxidative burst…). The cost of these effector responses is uneasy to estimate. However, considering the marginal mass of the immune system regarding the whole body mass, it is doubtful that the immune system would be a significant consumer of nutritional resources, even upon severe immune activation. Many immune responses are accompanied by an acute phase response, which involves non immune tissue. It is characterized by the synthesis of acute phase proteins in the liver, fever, accelerated whole-body protein turnover, and high rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Clearly the acute phase response is a process that is both nutrient liberating (skeletal muscle catabolism) and nutrient consuming (acute phase protein synthesis, fever). Experimental data show that inflammation alters the metabolism of amino acids in pigs. Some of them, such as histidine, valine, threonine, arginine or tryptophan, displayed more severe and long lasting alterations, maybe related either to their role as a substrate for gluconeogenesis or ketogenesis, either as specific precursors / substrates for immune processes. Glucose metabolism is also severely affected. Based on this knowledge, various nutritional strategies have been tested, to adequately feed the immunologically challenged pig, limit inflammation and minimize growth deterioration. This presentation focuses on two of them: moderate feed restriction displayed mixed results, while tryptophan supplementation is more promising.",['sdv']

In the United Kingdom, in which the term non take-up of social benefits originated, this phenomenon was first identified in the 1930s, and clearly coincided with a political preoccupation with ensuring that social security, particularly when targeted at specific sections of the population (means-testing benefits), was being correctly allocated. Even if the debate surrounding non take-up has different origins across different countries, it has always been a sign of political concern over the issue of effectiveness of social spending, the difference between planned versus actual impact, and most importantly, that the benefits on offer actually reach those they are intended for.",['shs']
A novel multi-fiber Timoshenko beam finite element formulation with embedded discontinuities to describe reinforced concrete failure under static loadings,"A novel multi-fiber beam finite element formulation based on the Timoshenko model is proposed in this paper to simulate failure of reinforced concrete structural elements subjected to static monotonic loadings. The beam section can have an arbitrary shape and each fiber has a local constitutive law representing a specific material. The embedded discontinuity concept is adopted to enrich the displacement field of the fibers in order to describe the opening of cracks and the development of plastic hinges. The material behavior at the discontinuity is characterized by a cohesive law linking the axial stress and the displacement jump by a linear relation, which allows capturing the released fracture energy. The variational formulation is presented in the context of the incompatible modes method. Moreover, the additional modes are statically condensed at the element level. The corresponding computational procedure is detailed in the paper. Several numerical applications and general remarks are finally provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed element.",['spi']
"MPI communication on MPPA Many-core NoC: design, modeling and performance issues","—Power dissipation and energy consumption has become a major issue for high performance computing and embedded systems. Keeping up with the performance trend of the last decades cannot be achieved anymore by stepping up the clock speed of processors. The usual strategy is nowadays to use lower frequency and to increase the number of cores. On such recent systems, data communication and memory bandwidth can become the main barrier, since there are more and more processing units to coordinate. In this paper, we introduce an MPI design and its implementation on the MPPA-256 (Multi Purpose Processor Array) processor from Kalray Inc., one of the first worldwide actors in the many-core architecture field. A model was developed to evaluate the communication performance and bottlenecks on MPPA. Our achieved result of 1.2 GB/s, e.g. 75% of peak throughput, for on-chip communication shows that the MPPA is a promising architecture for next-generation HPC systems, with its high performance-to-power ratio and high-bandwidth network-on-chip. However, the lack of a globally addressable memory on this distributed-memory architecture still requires the developer to take care of cache coherence and to pay attention to the limited local memory space of each compute element.",['info']

"Tourism, recreation and regional development : Perspectives from France and abroad","What factors contribute to tourism and recreation development? How can we characterise stakeholder rationales and organisation modes to enhance tourism resources and foster tourism and recreation services? To what extent do tourism and recreation contribute to regional development? What changes are taking place in terms of new destinations, stakeholders, policy objectives? Bringing together scholars from the fields of planning, economics, sociology, management studies and geography, this book examines cross-cutting issues in tourism and recreation with the aim of developing an extended view of leisure time. Focusing mainly on France with comparison to the experience of Northern and Southern European countries and North America, it combines a diverse range of case studies to address issues such as contrasting rural dynamics, changing public policies, sustainable development imperatives, evolving user behaviour and increasingly diverse recreation activities and stakeholder organisation. Specific topics are highlighted, such as the role of social capital or culture as factors of recreation development; resort organisation from international and experience-based perspectives; and the usefulness of the capability approach to evaluate tourism impacts on local development. Emphasising policy recommendations to help public or collective action on the issues and presenting emerging trends in the field, this book should be of interest to students, scholars and stakeholders in tourism/recreation planning and management.",['shs']
From urban violence to everyday tensions over occupying public spaces in a marginalised social housing neighbourhood in France,"The expression ‘urban violence’ evokes in France the violent confrontations between youths and security forces in specific neighbourhoods of the city. The latter are located on the margins of the city; have a high level of unemployment, especially in the 18-26 age range; have a higher number of single parent families and lower earnings than other parts of the city, as well as a higher percentage of residents linked to post-colonial immigration. But what is specifically ‘urban’ about urban violence? This term obscures the social dimensions of this type of violence: who is perpetrating it and what are their conditions and motivations? Instead I propose to consider violence as a kind of language and to inquire into perpetrators’ needs behind the acts of violence: the need for recognition, and the need to find a place in society.",['shs']
Baby Boomers Driving Alone?,"Though social sciences have devoted a great deal of attention to perceived inequalities, not much has been done to investigate how dissatisfaction with income inequality varies across subgroups over time. This study shows that income groups, educational groups and cohorts have moved in parallel since the beginning of the 1990s. Contrasting with the notion that post-scarcity generations should be more opposed to income inequality, it is also found that baby boomers are driving the generational dynamics of dissatisfaction with income gaps. These findings suggest that generation renewal will fuel tolerance for inequality, because of baby boomers leaving the scene and being replaced by younger cohorts not as sensitive to income differences.",['shs']

The findings, confirming the impact of music on immersion, can thus help managers design effective website.",['shs']
Quand la France était libérale,"Souvent associé au monde anglo-américain, le libéralisme se décline aussi à la française. Un ouvrage collectif raconte la redécouverte, à partir des années 1950, de cette tradition libérale plurielle par des intellectuels souvent critiques du système totalitaire. Le libéralisme est au coeur des débats politiques contemporains depuis les années 1970, notamment en raison du succès politique de l'un de ses courants : le néo-libéralisme 1. L'ouvrage collectif dirigé par Iain Stewart et Stephen W. Sawyer, In Search of the Liberal Moment, fruit d'un colloque tenu à l'Université de Londres à Paris, vise à comprendre les conditions intellectuelles de ce renouveau du libéralisme politique en France après son déclin au cours de la première moitié du XX e siècle. L'historiographie sur le sujet lie ce moment libéral au tournant antitotalitaire de la pensée française. La traduction de L'Archipel du Goulag de Soljenitsyne en 1973 et l'épisode des Boat People vietnamiens auraient fourni les conditions favorables au déclin des dogmes structuralistes et marxistes au profit de la redécouverte d'une tradition intellectuelle libérale remontant au XIX e siècle, avec des auteurs tels que Benjamin Constant et Alexis de Tocqueville 2. Les contributeurs de In Search of the Liberal Moment complexifient cette interprétation en prenant davantage en compte le contexte politique dans lequel s'opère la redécouverte de cette tradition intellectuelle. En remontant aux années 1950, les directeurs du livre ont souhaité montrer que ce regain d'intérêt pour le libéralisme était tout sauf soudain et s'inscrivait dans une tradition politique hexagonale plus ancienne 3. L'idée même de l'existence d'un tel moment libéral, en rupture avec le passé, est nuancée par Stephen Sawyer qui considère qu'« il n'y a guère eu de moment significatif où la théorie politique libérale n'ait constitué, à tout le moins, une part importante de la conversation politique » (p. 192). Le philosophe Jean-Fabien Spitz conteste même l'idée assez répandue qu'il y aurait eu un renouveau libéral en rupture avec une culture républicaine française antilibérale. Selon lui, une certaine conception de la liberté serait même constitutive de la pensée républicaine française. C'est en revenant aux considérations socio-économiques des républicains français du XIX e siècle (comme Louis Blanc ou Charles Dupont-White) et à leur conception de la liberté comme capacité fondée sur un État protecteur que l'on peut poser les jalons d'une critique intellectuelle du néo-libéralisme.",['shs']
"360° vision, from panoramas to VR","With a £5 Google Cardboard and a cell phone, everyone can live a 360° immersive experience. Youtube provides a huge amount of content, professional or private. Blockbusters like Starwars, groups like Gorillaz post their latest film in 360 Vr format to literally plunge the audience into their worlds of images and sounds. 360° photos are now accessible with a single click at a reasonable price. In museums like Stonehenge or Museum Victoria in Melbourne, cylinder screens offer a collective experience, with a one to one scaled image. What seems to be a state of the art technology is in fact 230 years old. Everything started in 1787 in Edinburgh when Robert Barker (1739/1806) painted the first panorama. Barker did not just invent the 360° image, but also the scenography that makes the illusion perfect. The first patent was granted by American engineer Robert Fulton (1765/1815) in 1799 1 . It refers to “a circular picture without boundaries” but also describes the architecture, the position of the viewers, the way to get in and out. Between the end of the 18 th century and the beginning of the 20 th , panoramas were very successful and huge buildings were made such as the London Colosseum built in 1827 or the Hittorff’s “Rotonde des panoramas pour les Champs-Élysées” in 1842. The London Colosseum was also stated as a landmark and a belvedere.It is a common thought that cinema killed panoramas. It is partially true. At the dawn of the 20 th century, most panoramas closed, were destroyed or transformed. The memory of their greatness faded away. A very few remained until a late rebirth with digital techniques. But in fact, the idea of an immersive panoramic view has still being developed and improve over time. The Occulus Rift or HTC Vive can be considered of the heirs of panoramas. In the article, we will follow those evolutions and transformations from panoramas to VR.",['shs']
La shrinking city a-t-elle une forme ? Discussion autour du concept et de ses spatialités.,"Les concepts de décroissance urbaine et de shrinking city (traduit en français par ville décroissante et ville rétrécissante) sont aujourd'hui largement débattus dans les recherches en sciences humaines (géographie, aménagement du territoire, urbanisme, économie, sociologie, sciences politiques, etc.). De ces débats ont émergé plusieurs définitions laissant une marge de manoeuvre large dans l’interprétation de ces concepts, mais les chercheurs s'accordent tous autour d’un indicateur commun : le déclin démographique. Nous pouvons également constater que les définitions proposées sont d’ordre quantitative plus que qualitative. En effet, il y a une absence d’indicateurs concernant les spatialités du processus alors que pourtant, ce sont des aspects qui peuvent marquer profondément le paysage urbain (ex. : bâtis, parcelles et espaces publics abandonnés) et sur lesquels travaillent l’architecte, l’urbaniste ou encore le paysagiste. Dans le cadre de ce séminaire, notre communication visera à ouvrir le débat sur la place des indicateurs spatiaux dans les concepts et leurs définitions. Nous mettrons, en parallèle des définitions actuelles, les termes utilisés pour décrire les phénomènes spatiaux liés à la décroissance urbaine qui illustrent aussi bien un changement de statut des sols (ruralisation, désurbanisation, etc.) qu’une nouvelle forme urbaine (ville réduite, ville perforée, donuts, etc.). Nous montrerons ces phénomènes spontanés de reconfiguration de l’espace urbain à travers différents cas à différentes périodes de l’Histoire. Ceci nous permettra de faire le lien avec les questions aujourd’hui posées sur les territoires impactés par la décroissance, leur maîtrise du processus et leurs capacités d’explorer de nouveaux modèles urbains. ésumé Les concepts de décroissance urbaine et de shrinking city (traduit en français par ville décroissante et ville rétrécissante) sont aujourd'hui largement débattus dans les recherches en sciences humaines (géographie, aménagement du territoire, urbanisme, économie, sociologie, sciences politiques, etc.).

Exploring term proximity statistic for Arabic information retrieval,"Term proximity statistic, which consists of rewarding documents where the matched query terms occur in close proximity, has proved its effectiveness in document retrieval performance. However, this field of research remains unexplored for Arabic information retrieval (IR) despite of the non diacritical text and the rich morphology of Arabic language which complicate the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose to boost the Arabic information retrieval performance by using proximity information. Our aim is to evaluate proximity features for Arabic language in order to go beyond the bag-of-words, and to overcome the problems related to text preprocessing. We investigate several state-of-the-art proximity models, including the Cross-Term model (CRTER), the Markov Random Field model (MRF), the divergence from randomness (DFR) multinomial model, and the Positional Language Model (PLM). For preprocessing purposes, Khoja and light stemming algorithms have been used. Experiments are performed on the Arabic TREC-2001/2002 collection using Terrier IR platform. The obtained results show significant improvements by using proximity based-models for Arabic IR.",['info']

An automatic key discovery approach for data linking,"In the context of Linked Data, different kinds of semantic links can be established between data. However when data sources are huge, detecting such links manually is not feasible. One of the most important types of links, the identity link, expresses that different identifiers refer to the same real world entity. Some automatic data linking approaches use keys to infer identity links, nevertheless this kind of knowledge is rarely available. In this work we propose KD2R, an approach which allows the automatic discovery of composite keys in RDF data sources that may conform to different schemas. We only consider data sources for which the Unique Name Assumption is fulfilled. The obtained keys are correct with respect to the RDF data sources in which they are discovered. The proposed algorithm is scalable since it allows the key discovery without having to scan all the data. KD2R has been tested on real datasets of the international contest OAEI 2010 and on data sets available on the web of data, and has obtained promising results.",['info']
SAKey: Scalable Almost Key Discovery in RDF Data,"Exploiting identity links among RDF resources allows applications to efficiently integrate data. Keys can be very useful to discover these identity links. A set of properties is considered as a key when its values uniquely identify resources. However, these keys are usually not available. The approaches that attempt to automatically discover keys can easily be overwhelmed by the size of the data and require clean data. We present SAKey, an approach that discovers keys in RDF data in an efficient way. To prune the search space, SAKey exploits characteristics of the data that are dynamically detected during the process. Furthermore , our approach can discover keys in datasets where erroneous data or duplicates exist (i.e., almost keys). The approach has been evaluated on different synthetic and real datasets. The results show both the relevance of almost keys and the efficiency of discovering them.",['info']

PPARbeta in macrophages and atherosclerosis,"Macrophages are central cells in the genesis and development of atherosclerosis, one of the major causes of cardiovascular diseases. Macrophages take up lipids (mainly cholesterol and triglycerides) from lipoproteins thus transforming into foam cells. Moreover, through the efflux pathway, macrophages are the main actors of the elimination of excessive tissue cholesterol toward extra-cellular acceptors. Macrophages participate in the control of inflammation by displaying different functional phenotypes, from the M1 pro-inflammatory to the M2 anti-inflammatory state. The nuclear receptor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR)beta (also called PPARdelta or PPARbeta/delta) is expressed in macrophages where it plays a different role in the control of lipid metabolism, inflammation and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. This review will summarize our current understanding of how PPARbeta regulates macrophage biology and its impact on atherosclerosis. Differences between studies and species-specific macrophage gene regulation will be discussed.",['sdv']
The contribution of unclassified techniques to the offensive activity of judokas medalists in the category (-60 kg) at the 2004-2012 Olympic Games.L’apport des techniques non classées à l’activité offensive des judokas médaillés de la catégorie (-60 kg) lors des Jeux Olympiques 2004-2012,"Objective: This work aimed to test the impact of unclassified techniques, produced by creativity but not yet included in the official classifications, on the offensive activity of judokas medalists in the category (-60 kg).Materials and methods: The deferred observation covered the combats (n=62) of male medalists (3 Gold, 3 Silver, and 6 Bronze) took part in Athens 2004, Beijing 2008, and London 2012 Olympic Games. A comparison of the variables justifying offensive activity using classified and unclassified techniques was made.Results: The analysis of the results confirmed the predominant role of techniques unclassified in the offensive activity of these medalists thanks to their high frequencies, wider repertoires, better scores, and higher effectiveness.Conclusion: Their integration in the official classifications for solving complex technical and tactical problems would be desirable for high-level judo development.Objectif : Le but du présent travail a été d’évaluer l’incidence des techniques non classées, produit de la créativité mais ne figurant pas encore dans les classifications officielles, sur l’activité offensive des judokas médaillés de la catégorie (-60 kg).Matériel et méthodes : L’observation en différé a porté sur les soixante-deux (62) combats auxquels ont pris part les douze (12) judokas couronnés (3 Or, 3 Argent et 6 Bronze) lors des olympiades 2004, 2008 et 2012. Une comparaison des variables justifiant l’activité offensive par le biais des techniques classées et non classées a été effectuée.Résultats : L’analyse des résultats obtenus a conforté le rôle prépondérant des techniques non classées dans l’activité offensive de ces médaillés grâce à leurs fréquences élevées, des registres plus larges, des scores meilleurs et des rendements supérieurs.Conclusion : Leur intégration dans les classifications officielles pour la résolution des problèmes techniques et tactiques au demeurant complexes serait souhaitable pour le développement du judo de haut niveau.",['shs']
Tracing the origins of SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus phylogenies,"SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus (CoV), which emerged in China in late 2019 and is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic that caused more than 59 million infections and 1.4 million deaths in 11 months. Understanding the origin of this virus is an important issue and it is necessary to determine the mechanisms of its dissemination in order to contain future epidemics. Based on phylogenetic inferences, sequence analysis and structure-function relationships of coronavirus proteins, informed by the knowledge currently available on the virus, we discuss the different scenarios evoked to account for the origin - natural or synthetic - of the virus. The data currently available is not sufficient to firmly assert whether SARS-CoV2 results from a zoonotic emergence or from an accidental escape of a laboratory strain. This question needs to be solved because it has important consequences on the evaluation of risk/benefit balance of our interaction with ecosystems, the intensive breeding of wild and domestic animals, as well as some lab practices and on scientific policy and biosafety regulations. Regardless of its origin, studying the evolution of the molecular mechanisms involved in the emergence of pandemic viruses is essential to develop therapeutic and vaccine strategies and to prevent future zoonoses.

New technology for ethanol production,"A new technology for ethanol production is proposed. For this purpose immobilized yeast cells of strainsSaccharomyces cerevisiae 46 EVD or Saccharomyces cerevisiae BO 213 were used. Double coated Caalginatecapsules realized with a new method for immobilization was applied. In this way, a maximalmechanical stability of immobilized cells was achieved. For control algorithm design, a software sensor ofethanol production rate based on on-line or laboratory measurements of ethanol concentration was derived.The software sensor information is used to switch automatically mode of cultivation from batch to continuousone. Applying direct digital control by LABVIEW system, ethanol concentration is stabilized at a constantvalue that guarantees maximum productivity.",['sde']

Biomass, substrate and product concentrations inside immobilized compounds are estimated as well.",['sde']
Disassembly operations’ efficiency evaluation in virtual environment,"Disassembly operations play a very important role during the initial design phase of industrial products. The disassembly evaluation methods available today seldom make disassembly as the preferred end-of-life solution for the reuse of parts or components in an economically sustainable way for lower value products. In virtual environment (VE), for instance, a human model is often involved in a digital mock-up (DMU) model for assembly/disassembly (A/D) evaluation. However, it has limited application areas because of the high cost investment. Focusing on the evaluation of disassembly operations in a virtual environment, a method based on five new criteria - visibility of a part, disassembly angles, number of tools’ changes, path orientation changing, and sub-assembly stability - is proposed here. All five criteria are presented by automatically calculated dimensionless coefficients, thus allowing the evaluation of the complexity of disassembly sequences in a virtual environment. For this purpose, a mixed virtual reality disassembly environment (VRDE) based on Python programming language has been developed, using VTK (Visualization Toolkit) and ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) libraries. The results of the analysis and findings demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach thus providing significant assistance for the evaluation",['spi']
Sequences planning for products disassembly based on lowest levels disassembly graph method,"Integration of disassembly operations during product design is an important issue today. As known, the number of possible disassembly sequences increases significantly with the number of parts in a product. Thus, generating proper disassembly sequences is critical. Most of existing methods often require tremendous computational resources while, at the same time, they often fail to find realistic and optimal solutions for complex products disassembly. For selective disassembly, for instance, it is important to eliminate the components which are unrelated with the target prior to sequences’ generation. In order to address this configuration, this paper deals with a method for generating the feasible disassembly sequences for selective disassembly. It is based on the lowest levels of a disassembly product graph. Instead of considering the geometric constraints for each pair of components, the proposed method considers the geometric contact and collision relationships among the components in order to generate the proposed Disassembly Geometry Contacting Graph (DGCG). The generation of the disassembly sequences is based on the investigated three cases called micro unites, which consider all the possible situations of relationships among the components in the DGCG. The latter is then used for disassembly sequence generation thus allowing decreasing the number of possible disassembly sequences. For this purpose, a mixed Virtual Reality Disassembly Environment (VRDE) is developed based on Python programming language using mixed VTK (Visualization Toolkit) and ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) libraries. It is applied for automatic generation of the selective disassembly sequences and is illustrated within two examples.",['spi']
Assembly simulation using haptic devices,"Optimization and realistic simulation of the Assembly and Disassembly (A/D) process represent important research topics considering the role played by these operations throughout the Product Life-Cycle (PLC), from the design stage and up to the recycling at the end-of-life of a product. Although there are numerous studies in this field, many aspects are not yet completely developed or validated. In recent years, Virtual Reality (VR) technology has evolved to new levels of complexity and integration. Now it combines several Human-Computer Interfaces (HCIs) in order to provide users various haptic sensations and to enable them becoming more immersed in the Virtual Environment (VE). Thus, VEs are starting to be frequently used in simulating operations from different domains of activity, among which the A/D process represents a key research area. Many of these applications are currently using haptic feedback and are facing significant difficulties in simulating some detailed operations – e.g. assembly components’ insertion/extraction. After a review of existing haptic devices and immersive simulation platforms, the main purpose of this research is to improve the A/D process simulation by proposing a new method and associated tools and better integration with commercial haptic devices. To this end, the first objective is to evaluate the impact of a mobility module, based on predefined kinematic constraints between components, able to guide user’s movements when simulating A/D operations. This can be achieved through an intelligent management of the assembly components relative mobilities in contact situations. The second objective is to find out if the proposed approach can be integrated with a new moderate cost haptic system: hardware plus software, for industrial use. In this sense, a comparative analysis of the simulation quality provided by two haptic devices is proposed.",['spi']
Numerical investigation of the combined effects of curvature and normal stress on sheet metal formability,"A number of parts and components involved in the automotive industry are made of thin bent sheets, which are subjected to out-of-plane compressive stresses in addition to traditional in-plane stresses. Unfortunately, the classical predictions based on the conventional concept of Forming Limit Diagram (FLD) are no longer relevant when the strain distribution is heterogonous over the sheet thickness. Therefore, this conventional FLD concept is not capable of accounting for the effect of out-of-plane stresses on the onset of localized necking. The aim of the present contribution is to propose an extension of the well-known Marciniak–Kuczynski approach to simultaneously account for the effect of curvature and normal stress on formability prediction. The new developed tool allows predicting the limit strains for the whole range of strain paths. The mechanical behavior of the studied sheets follows the rigid–plastic flow theory. Through numerical results, it is shown that both curvature and normal stress tend to increase the formability limit of the sheet metal.",['spi']
Magnetic polymer 'nanopills,"With specialist knowledge of polymer-based, self-assembled nanoparticles, the Laboratoire de Chimie des Polymères Organiques shares developments in polymer synthesis and polymer materials. We are a group of 5 tenured academic researchers and about 15 non-permanent researchers in the Laboratoire de Chimie des Polymères Organiques, a joint research unit of CNRS, University of Bordeaux, and Bordeaux National Polytechnic Institute, dedicated to polymer synthesis and polymer materials. More precisely, our group develops polymer-based self-assembled nanoparticles with high loading rates of active pharmaceutical ingredient (anticancer drugs, peptides, proteins...), multi-modal labelling (MRI, NIR...) and targeting (e.g. mAb). Our know-how includes the synthesis of biocompatible polymers such as polypeptides (by chemical synthesis or recombinant route), polysacharrides, and their combination as copolymers. We have a more than 1 decade experience in the design of multifunctional polymer vesicles called ""polymersomes"" loaded with drugs, iron oxide nanoparticles, grafted to antibodies, and several patents including one licensed to a pharmaceutical company located in Lyon (Adocia). We have some experience as participant in European projects, including a FP7 large NMP project (NANOTHER), which led to very promising results and productive interactions with biomedical companies, and we are now seeking to be active partners of a new H2020 project on nanomedicine.","['sdv', 'chim', 'phys']"
Existence of equilibrium in OLG economies with increasing returns,"We consider a standard overlapping generations (OLG) economy with a simple demographic structure where a new cohort of agents appears at each period and whose economic activity is extended over two successive periods, and finitely many firms may be active. The production possibilities are described by a sequence of production set-valued mappings and the main innovation comes from the fact that we allow for increasing returns to scale of more general type of non-convexities. To describe the behavior of the firms, we consider loss-free pricing rules, which cover the case of the average pricing rule, the competitive behavior when the firms have convex production sets, and the competitive behavior with quantity constraints à la Dehez–Drèze. We prove the existence of an equilibrium under assumptions, which are at the same level of generality than the ones for the existence in an exchange OLG economy.","['math', 'shs']"
Fastgene : une identification rapide des agressions bioterroristes,"With the current increase of asymmetric conflicts, a bioterrorist attack against the French armed forces or on the national territory is unfortunately no longer excluded. FASTGENE technology enables the sensitive, specific and inexpensive detection of the presence of pathogens in a sample in less than 8 minutes. This dual technology can be applied to many other applications outside the field of defense and securityAvec l'accroissement actuel des conflits asymétriques, une attaque bioterroriste à l'encontre des forces armées françaises ou sur le territoire national n'est malheureusement plus à exclure. Avec le soutien de la DGA, nous avons développé la technologie FASTGENE qui permet la détection sensible, spécifique et peu coûteuse, de la présence d'agents pathogènes dans un échantillon en moins de 8 minutes. Cette technologie duale peut s'appliquer de nombreuses autres applications en dehors du domaine de la défense et de la sécurité. Détecter et identifier rapidement les microorganismes: un besoin essentiel pour contrer les bioterroristes Le risque bioterroriste est particulièrement préoccupant puisqu'il se différencie des autres risques terroristes par des effets initialement masqués, puis amplifiés exponentiellement par le caractère contagieux d'un nombre croissant d'infections. La capacité de défense vis-à-vis de ce risque repose sur plusieurs piliers parmi lesquels la surveillance de l'environnement et la reconnaissance d'une agression jouent un rôle central. Une surveillance permanente et une reconnaissance rapide permettent en principe de limiter au maximum les conséquences d'une attaque. A la suite de l'attaque par lettres contenant des bacilles du charbon en 2001, les autorités des États-Unis ont décidé de déployer au niveau fédéral un système de surveillance de la qualité biologique de l'air, appelé Biowatch (1).

Les aérosols ainsi collectés sont analysés périodiquement par un réseau de laboratoires.

Red light for Anderson localization,"During the last 30 years, the search for Anderson localization of light in three-dimensional (3D) disordered samples yielded a number of experimental observations that were first considered successful, then disputed by opponents, and later refuted by their authors. This includes recent results for light in TiO_2 powders that T. Sperling et al. now show to be due to fluorescence and not to Anderson localization (New J. Phys. 18 (2016) 013039). The difficulty of observing Anderson localization of light in 3D may be due to a number of factors: insufficient optical contrast between the components of the disordered material, near-field effects, etc. The way to overcome these difficulties may consist in using partially ordered materials, complex structured scatterers, or clouds of cold atoms in magnetic fields.",['phys']

Human Reliability Assessment under Uncertainty – Towards a Formal Method,"Humans are and will remain one of the critical constituents of a technological system. The study of human factors is a broad domain with equally varying applications. Furthermore, with the advent of new technologies in safety-critical systems there is always a need to ensure system safety and reliability in accordance with increasingly demanding certification standards. Human reliability is a cause of concern as hardware becomes increasingly reliable and relatively human error is rising in its share of causing an accident. Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) provides a way to quantify the risk associated with a human. This paper presents a discussion on the development of a HRA model for the domain of transportation, rail transport in particular. Railway specific human factors studies are analyzed to identify safety relevant factors in order to create a relevant and relatively applicable Performance Shaping Factor list. This list of factors is compared with railway specific studies to address domain specific concerns, further augmenting it with quantification levels for each. A discussion on our proposition towards the integration of HRA for obtaining human induced system-level risk taking into account uncertainty in data and current work's positioning in proposed methodology is also included.",['info']

We review, classify and compare the recommendations given by four major European reports on the challenges that have to be met for a successful deployment of the FoF, and we identify the potential contributions of VR to this vision in terms of new technologies, worker-factory relationship, modular infrastructure and production efficiency. We argue that VR can be a key technology to support the FoF at all levels of the Systems Engineering approach, either directly by applying it in standard engineering processes, or indirectly by leveraging other useful technologies.",['info']

Linear Combining in Dependent $α$-Stable Interference,"Recently, there has been a proliferation of wireless communication technologies in unlicensed bands for the Internet of Things. A key question is whether these networks can coexist given that they have different power levels, symbol periods, and access protocols. The main challenge is to characterize the impact of mutual interference arising from distinct unco-ordinated networks. It is known that when interferers form a homogeneous Poisson point process and transmit only on a single subband, the interference is often well-modeled by the heavy-tailed α-stable distribution. In this paper, we focus on the scenario where interferers transmit on multiple subbands. Under a policy where each interferer independently accesses each band with probability p, we provide an exact characterization of the interference random vector. Exploiting this characterization, we derive optimal linear combining weights and an analytical approximation for the bit error rate (BER), accurate for large transmit power. A key observation is that the expression for the BER admits an interpretation in terms of an array gain and a fractional diversity gain.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
Ductility prediction of substrate-supported metal layers based on rate-independent crystal plasticity theory,"In several modern technological applications, the formability of functional metal components is often limited by the occurrence of localized necking. To retard the onset of such undesirable plastic instabilities and, hence, to improve formability, elastomer substrates are sometimes adhered to these metal components. The current paper aims to numerically investigate the impact of such elastomer substrates on the formability enhancement of the resulting bilayer. To this end, both the bifurcation theory and the initial imperfection approach are used to predict the inception of localized necking in substrate-supported metal layers. The fullconstraint Taylor scale-transition scheme is used to derive the mechanical behavior of a representative volume element of the metal layer from the behavior of its microscopic constituents (the single crystals). The mechanical behavior of the elastomer substrate follows the neo-Hookean hyperelastic model. The adherence between the two layers is assumed to be perfect. Through numerical simulations, it is shown that bonding an elastomer layer to a metal layer allows significant enhancement in formability, especially in the negative range of strain paths. These results highlight the benefits of adding elastomer substrates to thin metal components in several technological applications. Also, it is shown that the limit strains predicted by the initial imperfection approach tend towards the bifurcation predictions as the size of the geometric imperfection in the metal layer reduces.",['spi']
What’s decidable about parametric timed automata?,"Parametric timed automata (PTAs) are a powerful formalism to reason, simulate and formally verify critical real-time systems. After 25 years of research on PTAs, it is now well-understood that any non-trivial problem studied is undecidable for general PTAs. We provide here a survey of decision and computation problems for PTAs. On the one hand, bounding time, bounding the number of parameters or the domain of the parameters does not (in general) lead to any decidability. On the other hand, restricting the number of clocks, the use of clocks (compared or not with the parameters), and the use of parameters (e.g. used only as upper or lower bounds) leads to decidability of some problems. We also put emphasis on open problems. We also discuss formalisms close to parametric timed automata (such as parametric hybrid automata or parametric interrupt timed automata), and we study tools dedicated to PTAs and their extensions.",['info']
Prediction of Localized Necking Based on Crystal Plasticity: Comparison of Bifurcation and Imperfection Approaches,"In the present work, a powerful modeling tool is developed to predict and analyze the onset of strain localization in polycrystalline aggregates. The predictions of localized necking are based on two plastic instability criteria, namely the bifurcation theory and the initial imperfection approach. In this tool, a micromechanical model, based on the self-consistent scale-transition scheme, is used to accurately derive the mechanical behavior of polycrystalline aggregates from that of their microscopic constituents (the single crystals). The mechanical behavior of the single crystals is developed within a large strain rate-independent constitutive framework. This micromechanical constitutive modeling takes into account the essential microstructure-related features that are relevant at the microscale. These microstructural aspects include key physical mechanisms, such as initial and induced crystallographic textures, morphological anisotropy and interactions between the grains and their surrounding medium. The developed tool is used to predict sheet metal formability through the concept of forming limit diagrams (FLDs). The results obtained by the self-consistent averaging scheme, in terms of predicted FLDs, are compared with those given by the more classical full-constraint Taylor model. Moreover, the predictions obtained by the imperfection approach are systematically compared with those given by the bifurcation analysis, and it is demonstrated that the former tend to the latter in the limit of a vanishing size for the initial imperfection.",['spi']
Theoretical and numerical investigation of the impact of out-of-plane compressive stress on sheet metal formability,"In modern sheet metal forming processes, such as hydroforming and single point incremental forming, sheet metals are often subjected to out-of-plane compressive stresses in addition to traditional in-plane stresses. However, the effect of these out-of-plane stresses on the onset of plastic strain localization is not considered when classic necking criteria are used, as the latter are generally formulated based on the plane stress assumption. The main objective of the present investigation is to overcome this limitation by developing numerical tools and analytical relations that allow considering the influence of these compressive stresses on the prediction of localized necking. In the different tools developed, and for comparison purposes, finite strain versions of both the deformation theory of plasticity and the rigid-plastic flow theory are used to describe the mechanical behavior of the metal sheet. Furthermore, both the bifurcation theory and the initial imperfection approach are employed to predict the onset of strain localization. Various numerical predictions are reported to illustrate the effect of normal stress on the occurrence of localized necking in sheet metals. From these different results, it is clearly demonstrated that out-of-plane stresses may notably enhance sheet metal formability and, therefore, this property can be effectively used to avoid the initiation of early strain localization.",['spi']
ViP2P: XML Warehousing in P2P Networks,"The development of P2P networks leads to new opportunity for large-scale data sharing, and in particular sharing of Web data such as XML, RDF, or mixed data formats comprising XML documents with RDF annotations. We present the ViP2 approach (standing for views in peer-to-peer) for disseminating and efficiently querying XML data. ViP2P is built on top of a structured P2P network, and allows each peer to subscribe to XML query results. Moreover, ViP2P provides efficient mechanisms to process queries in snapshot mode, re-using the results of continuous queries stored on the other peers. We show how ViP2P generalizes and other previous XML data management models for P2P networks and conclude by a short demo of the system.",['info']

Adjoint-method-based estimation of Manning roughness coefficient in an overland flow model,"An optimal estimation approach for distributed Manning roughness coefficient in an overland flow based on the adjointmethod is here proposed. Through some appropriate assumptions and simplifications, the governing equation describing the system is derived from the first continuity equation of thewell-known one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations. In this equation, the empirical Manning parameter is considered to be unknown and can be estimated through a new parameter called K which is approximated by a Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) with specified weighting factors. Estimation of distributed Manning coefficient can be reduced to estimation of weighting factors of RBFN. Infiltrationprocess is also taken account in this work via the so-called Green-Amptmodel. For the optimization, the adjoint model is obtained by means of a variationalapproach. Because of their non-linearity and complexity, the system and adjoint equations arenumerically solved by using nonlinear implicit Preissmann schemes. Using steepest decent method and backtracking line search method, the cost functional isoptimized in order to estimate the mentioned weighting factorsfrom a set of lumped observation values. Finally, the method is illustrated on a simulated example with a simple overland flow and infiltration over a variable rainfall period.",['spi']
Adjustable Compliance Joint with Torsion Spring for Human Centered Robots,"Human-centred robots should be human-friendly, safe and impact-free. The present work is devoted to the problem of adjustable compliance implementation during the human friendly robots design. A new solution of a compliant joint with passive compliance adjustment based on a leaf torsion spring with variable length is presented. It allows independent positioning and stiffness regulation in a wide range. Some basic characteristics of the leaf torsion spring such as: stiffness, compliance, allowable torque, angle of elastic deformation and generated potential energy are analyzed. Thereafter numerical simulations are performed and the influence of the structural parameters on the basic compliant joint characteristics is estimated. Tests with a specially realized prototype of adjustable compliant joint are carried out and the basic characteristics of the prototype are evaluated. The results from the experimental assessment show a very good correlation with the numerical ones.",['spi']
A nonconforming high-order method for nonlinear poroelasticity,"In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for the quasi-static nonlin-ear poroelasticity problem describing Darcian flow in a deformable saturated porous medium. The nonlinear elasticity operator is discretized using a Hybrid High-Order method while the heterogeneous diffusion part relies on a Symmetric Weighted Interior Penalty discontinuous Galerkin scheme. The method is valid in two and three space dimensions, delivers an inf-sup stable discretization on general meshes including polyhedral elements and nonmatching interfaces, allows arbitrary approximation orders, and has a reduced cost thanks to the possibility of statically condensing a large subset of the unknowns for linearized versions of the problem. Moreover, the proposed construction can handle rough variations of the permeability coefficient and vanishing specific storage coefficient. Numerical tests demonstrating the performance of the method are provided.",['math']

Probabilistic Error Model for a Lane Marking Based Vehicle Localization Coupled to Open Source Maps,"—Recent works have focused on lane marking feature based vehicle localization using enriched maps. The localization precision of existing methods depends strongly on the accuracy of the maps which are specially customized. In this article, we propose a marking feature based vehicle localization using open source map. Our method makes use of multi-criterion confidences to infer potential errors, and in advance, to en-hance the vehicle localization. At first, the vision-based lane marking models are obtained. Meanwhile, the map-based lane markings of current state are derived from map databases. Both lane marking sources are fused together to implement vehicle localization, using a multi-kernel based algorithm. In order to further improve the localization performance, a probabilistic error model is employed to identify the possible errors. The experiments have been carried out on public database. The results show that error modeling leads to a lower average lateral error in localization result.",['info']
Real time in situ dissolved gases monitoring in groundwater by CF-MIMS for hydrogeology,"We present an optimized Continuous Flow - Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer (CF-MIMS) for in situ real time monitoring of dissolved gases in groundwater. Our system allows continuous measurements of nobles gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe) and CO2, O2, N2, N2O, H2, CH4 in water. A large membrane introduction system and an adapted ionisation procedure allow our system to measure all gases every 15s or one gas every 1.5 s. We present here the results of dissolved gases tracer tests in a fractured aquifer as well as an in situ real time welllogging of dissolved gases The high resolution breakthrough curve of the dissolved gas tracer improve our knowledge on transport characteristics in fractured aquifers. High resolution profiles of dissolved gases in boreholes inform us about stratification of water masses, redox and recharge conditions (NGT, Excess air) and allow 4He age estimation. This breakthrough in the measurement of dissolved gases (in situ monitoring and high frequency) is very promissing for physical, chemical and biogeochemical studies in waters.",['phys']
Software for verification of collision avoidance algorithms via Optimal Control Techniques,"The goal of the talk is to present a verification procedure for car collision avoidance algorithms using reachable set information and optimal control techniques. After defining the car models and the scenarios with avoidable objects, consistent with the measured data provided by Volkswagen, we create an algorithm which is able to give an output data comparable with the ones of the Volkswagen algorithms. To do this it is needs to define mathematically when a collision will occur or not. This definition is based on reachable set information and optimal control problem solutions. Moreover we take into account sensor perturbations in relation to their mathematical model. The task is to find sensor tolerance ranges guaranteeing that a certain failure rate probability is not exceeded. Speaker: Ilaria Xausa",['math']
Belief revision generalized: A joint characterization of Bayes' and Je¤rey's rules,"We present a general framework for representing belief-revision rules and use it to characterize Bayes' rule as a classical example and Jeffrey's rule as a non-classical one. In Je¤rey's rule, the input to a belief revision is not simply the information that some event has occurred, as in Bayes' rule, but a new assignment of probabilities to some events. Despite their differences, Bayes' and Je¤rey's rules can be characterized in terms of the same axioms: responsiveness, which requires that revised beliefs incorporate what has been learnt, and conservativeness, which requires that beliefs on which the learnt input is 'silent' do not change. To illustrate the use of non-Bayesian belief revision in economic theory, we sketch a simple decision-theoretic application.",['shs']
"Capital Imports Composition, Complementarities, and the Skill Premium in Developing Countries","We study how the composition of capital imports affects relative demand for skill and the skill premium in a sample of developing economies. Capital imports per se do not affect the skill premium; in contrast, their composition does. While imports of R&D-intensive capital equipment raise the skill premium, imports of less innovative equipment lower it. We estimate that R&D-intensive capital is complementary to skilled workers, whereas less innovative capital equipment is complementary to unskilled labor---which explains the composition effect. This mechanism has substantial explanatory power. Variation in tariffs, freight costs and overall barriers to trade, over time and across types of capital, favors imports of skill-complementary capital over other types. We calculate that reductions in barriers to trade increase inequality substantially in developing countries through the composition channel.",['shs']
Aggregation theory and the relevance of some issues to others,"I propose a relevance-based independence axiom on how to aggregate individual yes/no judgments on given propositions into collective judgments: the collective judgment on a proposition depends only on people's judgments on propositions which are relevant to that proposition. This axiom contrasts with the classical independence axiom: the collective judgment on a proposition depends only on people's judgments on the same proposition. I generalize the premise-based rule and the sequential-priority rule to an arbitrary priority order of the propositions, instead of a dichotomous premise/conclusion order resp. a linear priority order. I prove four impossibility theorems on relevance-based aggregation. One theorem simultaneously generalizes Arrow's Theorem (in its general and indifference-free versions) and the well-known Arrow-like theorem in judgment aggregation.",['shs']
An International Look at the Growth of Modern Finance,"We study the rise of finance across a set of now-industrial economies. The long run pattern of the growth of the income share of finance from the 19th century to current times in the United States is similar to some economies, but not all economies reach the same size and instead reach a plateau. The relationship between financial output and income is non-homothetic and changes three times in this sample. Most of the increase in real GDP per capita from 1870 occurred while financial output and the income share of finance were smaller than their size in 1980. After 1980 the elasticity of income with respect to financial output falls significantly. We find considerable heterogeneity in the size of finance in recent times. There is no evidence for an increase in the unit cost of financial intermediation. We find that information technology and financial deregulation can help explain the increase in relative skill intensity and in relative wages in finance, while common trends, which may be related to financial globalization, also play a role.",['shs']
Is Technological Change Biased Towards the Unskilled in Services? An Empirical Investigation,"I fit a two-sector general equilibrium model to U.S. data in 1963--2005 in order to infer technological processes that affect the college premium. In skill intensive services factor augmenting technological change is slower for college graduates relative to less skilled workers. I find the opposite in the rest of the economy. This indicates that technological change is more complex than what we observe at the aggregate level. The results are consistent with changes in occupational mixes: low-skill workers in services reallocate into computer complementary occupations to a greater extent than college graduates in that sector. Occupational mixes in the rest of the private sector shift in the opposite direction. Thus, theoretical treatments of the underlying mechanisms of skill biased technological change may be improved by taking into account occupational mixes within broad education-sector groups.",['shs']
"African Export Successes: Surprises, Stylized Facts and Explanations","We establish the following stylized facts: (1) Exports are characterized by Big Hits, (2) the Big Hits change from one period to the next, and (3) these changes are not explained by global factors like global commodity prices. These conclusions are robust to excluding extractable products (oil and minerals) and other commodities. Moreover, African Big Hits exhibit similar patterns as Big Hits in non-African countries. We also discuss some concerns about data quality. These stylized facts are inconsistent with the traditional view that sees African exports as a passive commodity endowment, where changes are driven mostly by global commodity prices. In order to better understand the determinants of export success in Africa we interviewed several exporting entrepreneurs, government officials and NGOs. Some of the determinants that we document are conventional: moving up the quality ladder, utilizing strong comparative advantage, trade liberalization, investment in technological upgrades, foreign ownership, ethnic networks, and personal foreign experience of the entrepreneur. Other successes are triggered by idiosyncratic factors like entrepreneurial persistence, luck, and cost shocks, and some of the successes occur in areas that usually fail.",['shs']
Ambiguity Preferences and Portfolio Choices,"We match administrative panel data on portfolio choices with survey data on preferences over ambiguity. We show that ambiguity averse investors bear more risk, due to a lack of diversification. In particular, they exhibit a form of home bias that leads to higher exposure to the domestic relative to the international stock market. While more sensitive to market factors, their returns are on average higher, suggesting that ambiguity averse investors need not be driven out of the market for risky assets. We also show that these investors rebalance their portfolio more actively and in a contrarian direction relative to past market trends, which allow them to keep their risk exposure relatively constant over time. We discuss these findings in relation to the theoretical literature on portfolio choice under ambiguity.",['shs']
Bundlers Dilemmas in Financial Markets with Sampling Investors,"We study banks' incentive to pool assets of heterogeneous quality when investors evaluate pools by extrapolating from limited sampling. Pooling assets of heterogeneous quality induces dispersion in investors' valuations without affecting their average. Prices are determined by market clearing assuming that investors can neither borrow nor short-sell. A monopolistic bank has the incentive to create heterogeneous bundles only when investors have enough money. When the number of banks is sufficiently large, oligopolistic banks choose extremely heterogeneous bundles, even when investors have little money and even if this turns out to be collectively detrimental to the banks. If, in addition, banks can originate low quality assets, even at a cost, this collective inefficiency is exacerbated and pure welfare losses arise. Robustness to the presence of rational investors and to the possibility of short-selling is discussed.",['shs']
Balance Problems in ChildrenTroubles de l'équilibre chez l'enfant,"A booklet about balance problems in children. Why expand our field of interest from deafness towards balance? It has only relatively recently been acknowledged that balance problems are frequently associated to deafness in children. Testing the vestibular apparatus is now more often included in the clinical test for deaf children. It is estimated that 20% of profound hearing losses are associated with vestibular areflexia, and that 40% have a partial deficit. Nevertheless, vestibular impairment can also be found in children with normal hearing, although much less frequently.

Repeated exponential sine sweeps for the autonomous estimation of nonlinearities and bootstrap assessment of uncertainties,"Measurements on vibrating structures has been a topic of interest for decades. Vibrating structures are however generally assumed to behave linearly and in a noise-free environment, which is not the case in practice. This paper provides a methodology that allows for the autonomous estimation of nonlinearities and assessment of uncertainties by bootstrap on a given vibrating structure. Nonlinearities are estimated by means of a block-oriented nonlinear model approach based on parallel Hammerstein models and on exponential sine sweeps. Estimation uncertainties are simultaneously assessed using repetitions of the input signal (multi-sine sweeps) as the input of a bootstrap procedure. Mathematical foundations and a practical implementation of the method are discussed using an experimental example. The experiment chosen here consists in exciting a steel plate under various boundary conditions with exponential sine sweeps and at different levels in order to assess the evolution of nonlinearities and uncertainties over a wide range of frequencies and input amplitudes.","['math', 'spi']"
Repeated exponential sine sweeps for the autonomous estimation of nonlinearities and bootstrap assessment of uncertainties,"Systems and structures are generally assumed to behave linearly and in a noise-free environment. This is in practice not perfectly the case. First, nonlinear phenomena can appear and second, the presence of noise is unavoidable for all experimental measurements. Nonlinearities can be considered as a deterministic process in the sense that in the absence of noise the output signal depends only on the input signal. Noise is purely stochastic: in the absence of an input signal, the output signal is not null and cannot be predicted at any arbitrary instant. It turns out that these two issues are coupled: all the noise that is not correctly removed from the measurements could be misinterpreted as nonlinearities, and if nonlinearities are not accurately estimated, they will end up within the noise signal and information about the system under study will be lost. The underlying idea consists here in extracting the maximum of available linear and nonlinear deterministic information from measurements without misinterpreting noise.",['spi']
Abella: A System for Reasoning about Relational Specifications,"The Abella interactive theorem prover is based on an intuitionistic logic that allows for inductive and co-inductive reasoning over relations. Abella supports the λ-tree approach to treating syntax containing binders: it allows simply typed λ-terms to be used to represent such syntax and it provides higher-order (pattern) unification, the ∇ quantifier, and nominal constants for reasoning about these representations. As such, it is a suitable vehicle for formalizing the meta-theory of formal systems such as logics and programming languages. This tutorial exposes Abella incrementally, starting with its capabilities at a first-order logic level and gradually presenting more sophisticated features, ending with the support it offers to the two-level logic approach to meta-theoretic reasoning. Along the way, we show how Abella can be used prove theorems involving natural numbers, lists, and automata, as well as involving typed and untyped λ-calculi and the π-calculus.",['info']
Immune function during pregnancy varies between ecologically distinct populations,"Background and objectives: Among placental mammals, females undergo immunological shifts during pregnancy to accommodate the fetus (i.e. fetal tolerance). Fetal tolerance has primarily been characterized within post-industrial populations experiencing evolutionarily novel conditions (e.g. reduced pathogen exposure), which may shape maternal response to fetal antigens. This study investigates how ecological conditions affect maternal immune status during pregnancy by comparing the direction and magnitude of immunological changes associated with each trimester among the Tsimane (a subsistence population subjected to high pathogen load) and women in the USA.",['shs']
Evolutionary origins of money categorization and exchange: an experimental investigation in tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.),"Money is a cultural artefact with a central role in human society. Here, we investigated whether some features of money may be traced back to the exchange habits of nonhuman animals, capitalizing on their ability to flexibly use tokens in dif-ferent domains. In Experiment 1, we evaluated whether capuchins can recognize token validity. Six subjects were required to exchange with the experimenter valid/familiar tokens, valid/unfamiliar tokens, invalid tokens, and no-value items. They first exchanged a similar number of valid/familiar and valid/unfamiliar tokens, followed by exchanges of invalid tokens and no-value items. Thus, as humans, capuchins readily recognized token validity, regardless of familiarity. In Experiment 2, we further evaluated the flexibility of the token–food association by assessing whether capuchins could engage in reverse food–token exchanges. Subjects spontaneously performed chains of exchanges, in which a food item was exchanged for a token, and then the token was exchanged for another food. However, performance was better as the advantage gained from the exchange increased. Overall, capuchins recognized token validity and successfully engaged in chains of reverse and direct exchanges. This suggests that—although nonhuman animals are far from having fully-fledged monetary systems—for capuchins tokens share at least some features with human money.",['shs']
Multi-system physiological dysregulation and ageing in a subsistence population,"Humans have the longest post-reproductive lifespans and lowest rates of actuarial ageing among primates. Understanding the links between slow actuarial ageing and physiological change is critical for improving the human ‘healthspan’. Physiological dysregulation may be a key feature of ageing in industrialized populations with high burdens of chronic ‘diseases of civilization’, but little is known about age trajectories of physiological condition in subsistence populations with limited access to public health infrastructure. To better characterize human physiological dysregulation, we examined age trajectories of 40 biomarkers spanning the immune (n = 13 biomarkers), cardiometabolic (n = 14), musculoskeletal (n = 6) and other (n = 7) systems among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists of the Bolivian Amazon using mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal data (n = 22 115 observations). We characterized age-related changes using a multi-system statistical index of physiological dysregulation (Mahalanobis distance; Dm) that increases with age in both humans and other primates. Although individual biomarkers showed varied age profiles, we found a robust increase in age-related dysregulation for Tsimane (β = 0.17–0.18) that was marginally faster than that reported for an industrialized Western sample (β = 0.14–0.16), but slower than that of other non-human primates. We found minimal sex differences in the pace or average level of dysregulation for Tsimane. Our findings highlight some conserved patterns of physiological dysregulation in humans, consistent with the notion that somatic ageing exhibits species-typical patterns, despite cross-cultural variation in environmental exposures, lifestyles and mortality.",['shs']
Navigating cross-cultural research: methodological and ethical considerations,"The intensifying pace of research based on cross-cultural studies in the social sciences necessitates a discussion of the unique challenges of multi-sited research. Given an increasing demand for social scientists to expand their data collection beyond WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic) populations, there is an urgent need for transdisciplinary conversations on the logistical, scientific and ethical considerations inherent to this type of scholarship. As a group of social scientists engaged in cross-cultural research in psychology and anthropology, we hope to guide prospective cross-cultural researchers through some of the complex scientific and ethical challenges involved in such work: (a) study site selection, (b) community involvement and (c) culturally appropriate research methods. We aim to shed light on some of the difficult ethical quandaries of this type of research. Our recommendation emphasizes a community-centred approach, in which the desires of the community regarding research approach and methodology, community involvement, results communication and distribution, and data sharing are held in the highest regard by the researchers. We argue that such considerations are central to scientific rigour and the foundation of the study of human behaviour.",['shs']
Preserving quantifiable ethnographic records of disappearing human lifeways,"The human evolutionary sciences place high value on quantitative data from traditional small‐scale societies that are rapidly modernizing. These data often stem from the sustained ethnographic work of anthropologists who are today nearing the end of their careers. Yet many quantitative ethnographic data are preserved only in summary formats that do not reflect the rich and variable ethnographic reality often described in unpublished field notes, nor the deep knowledge of their collectors. In raw disaggregated formats, such data have tremendous scientific value when used in conjunction with modern statistical techniques and as part of comparative analyses. Through a personal example of longitudinal research with Batek hunter‐gatherers that involved collaboration across generations of researchers, we argue that quantifiable ethnographic records, just like material artifacts, deserve high‐priority preservation efforts. We discuss the benefits, challenges, and possible avenues forward for digitizing, preserving, and archiving ethnographic data before it is too late.",['shs']
Voluntary collective isolation as a best response to COVID-19 for indigenous populations? A case study and protocol from the Bolivian Amazon,"Indigenous communities worldwide share common features that make them especially vulnerable to the complications of and mortality from COVID-19. They also possess resilient attributes that can be leveraged to promote prevention efforts. How can indigenous communities best mitigate potential devastating effects of COVID-19? In Bolivia, where nearly half of all citizens claim indigenous origins, no specific guidelines have been outlined for indigenous communities inhabiting native communal territories. In this Public Health article, we describe collaborative efforts, as anthropologists, physicians, tribal leaders, and local officials, to develop and implement a multiphase COVID-19 prevention and containment plan focused on voluntary collective isolation and contact-tracing among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in the Bolivian Amazon. Phase 1 involves education, outreach, and preparation, and phase 2 focuses on containment, patient management, and quarantine. Features of this plan might be exported and adapted to local circumstances elsewhere to prevent widespread mortality in indigenous communities.",['shs']
Group size and collective action in a binary contribution game,"We consider how group size affects the private provision of a public good with non-refundable binary contributions. A fixed amount of the good is provided if and only if the number of contributors reaches an exogenous threshold. The threshold, the group size, and the identical, non-refundable cost of contributing to the public good are common knowledge. Our focus is on the case in which the threshold is larger than one, so that teamwork is required to produce the public good. We show that both expected payoffs and the probability that the public good is obtained in the best symmetric equilibrium are decreasing in group size. We also characterize the limit outcome when group size converges to infinity and provide precise conditions under which the expected number of contributors is decreasing or increasing in group size for sufficiently large groups.",['shs']
Paternal provisioning results from ecological change,"Paternal provisioning among humans is puzzling because it is rare among primates and absent in nonhuman apes and because emergent provisioning would have been subject to paternity theft. A provisioning “dad” loses fitness at the hands of nonprovisioning, mate-seeking “cads.” Recent models require exacting interplay between male provisioning and female choice to overcome this social dilemma. We instead posit that ecological change favored widespread improvements in male provisioning incentives, and we show theoretically how social obstacles to male provisioning can be overcome. Greater availability of energetically rich, difficult-to-acquire foods enhances female–male and male–male complementarities, thus altering the fitness of dads versus cads. We identify a tipping point where gains from provisioning overcome costs from paternity uncertainty and the dad strategy becomes viable. Stable polymorphic states are possible, meaning that dads need not necessarily eliminate cads. Our simulations suggest that with sufficient complementarities, dads can emerge even in the face of high paternity uncertainty. Our theoretical focus on ecological change as a primary factor affecting the trade-off between male mating and parenting effort suggests different possibilities for using paleo-climatic, archaeological, and genomic evidence to establish the timing of and conditions associated with emergence of paternal provisioning in the hominin lineage.",['shs']
Infant care practices among resettled refugee Mothers from East and Central Africa,"Refugees often parent under extreme circumstances. Parenting practices have implications for child outcomes, and parenting in the context of refugee resettlement is likely to be dynamic as parents negotiate a new culture. This study examined African origin mothers’ infant care values and practices related to feeding, carrying, and daily activities following resettlement in the Southeastern region of the U.S. Ten African origin mothers were asked about their infant care practices through semi-structured interviews. Results indicated that mothers valued breastfeeding but often chose to use formula as a supplement or instead of breastfeeding. In addition, participants valued carrying their infants close to the body but used equipment such as strollers. Mothers expressed that perceptions of American culture and rules, social support, interactions with community agencies, and the need to engage in formal employment were factors that influenced their infant care practices.",['shs']
Contextual factors modulate risk preferences in adult humans,"Humans have generally been considered risk averse for gains. Yet, growing evidence shows that risk preferences may change across reward currencies and depend on the type of tasks used to measure them. Here, we examined how context affects human risk preferences to shed light on the psychological mechanisms underlying human decision-making under risk. Participants were presented with a descriptive risky choice task involving repeated choices between real options and they were provided with trial-by-trial feedback. We manipulated the type of reward and, for the first time, the format of the choice stimuli. Options were either 2D computer-based images or concrete 3D objects, and participants received food or money as reward. First, we found that participants were more risk-seeking for food compared to money, suggesting that people treat money differently from consumable rewards. Second, we found that people were more risk-seeking when they made choices between concrete 3D objects than between 2D computer-based images. Our results strengthened the evidence that human choice patterns may change depending on the context and, for the first time, showed that the format of the choice stimuli does affect risk preferences, an important consideration for future research.",['shs']
Direct and indirect punishment of norm violations in daily life,"Across societies, humans punish norm violations. To date, research on the antecedents and consequences of punishment has largely relied upon agent-based modeling and laboratory experiments. Here, we report a longitudinal study documenting punishment responses to norm violations in daily life (k = 1507; N = 257) and test pre-registered hypotheses about the antecedents of direct punishment (i.e., confrontation) and indirect punishment (i.e., gossip and social exclusion). We find that people use confrontation versus gossip in a context-sensitive manner. Confrontation is more likely when punishers have been personally victimized, have more power, and value offenders more. Gossip is more likely when norm violations are severe and when punishers have less power, value offenders less, and experience disgust. Findings reveal a complex punishment psychology that weighs the benefits of adjusting others’ behavior against the risks of retaliation.",['shs']
The evolution of egg trading in simultaneous hermaphrodites,"Egg trading—whereby simultaneous hermaphrodites exchange each other’s eggs for fertilization—constitutes one of the few rigorously documented and most widely cited examples of direct reciprocity among unrelated individuals. Yet how egg trading may initially invade a population of nontrading simultaneous hermaphrodites is still unresolved. Here, we address this question with an analytical model that considers mate encounter rates and costs of egg production in a population that may include traders (who provide eggs for fertilization only if their partners also have eggs to reciprocate), providers (who provide eggs regardless of whether their partners have eggs to reciprocate), and withholders (cheaters who mate only in the male role and just use their eggs to elicit egg release from traders). Our results indicate that a combination of intermediate mate encounter rates, sufficiently high costs of egg production, and a sufficiently high probability that traders detect withholders (in which case eggs are not provided) is conducive to the evolution of egg trading. Under these conditions, traders can invade—and resist invasion from—providers and withholders alike.

The majority of work in this area focuses on mental state representation (‘theory of mind’), but has had limited success in explaining individual differences in this ability, and is characterized by the lack of a theoretical framework that can account for the effect of variability inthe population of minds to which individuals are exposed.We draw analogies between faces and minds as complex social stimuli, and suggest thattheoretical and empirical progress on understanding the mechanisms underlying mind representation can be achieved by adopting a ‘Mind-space’framework; that minds, like faces, are represented withina multidimensional psychological space. This Mind-space framework can accommodate the representation of whole cognitive systems, and may help to explain individual differences in the consistency and accuracy with which the mental states of others are inferred. Mind-space may also have relevance for understanding human development, inter-group relations, and the atypical socialcognitionseen in several clinical conditions.",['shs']
Logical inferences from visual and auditory information in ruffed lemurs and sifakas,"Inference by exclusion, or the ability to select a correct course of action by systematically excluding other potential alternatives, is a form of logical inference that allows individuals to solve problems without complete information. Current comparative research shows that several bird, mammal and primate species can find hidden food through inference by exclusion. Yet there is also wide variation in how successful different species are as well as the kinds of sensory information they can use to do so. An important question is therefore why some species are better at engaging in logical inference than others. Here, we investigate the evolution of logical reasoning abilities by comparing strepsirrhine primate species that vary in dietary ecology: frugivorous ruffed lemurs (Varecia spp.) and folivorous Coquerel's sifakas, Propithecus coquereli. Across two studies, we examined their abilities to locate food using direct information versus inference from exclusion and using both visual and auditory information. In study 1, we assessed whether these lemurs could make inferences when full visual and auditory information about the two potential locations of food were provided. In study 2, we then compared their ability to make direct inferences versus inferences by exclusion in both the visual and auditory domains. We found that these lemur species can use visual information to find food, but that only ruffed lemurs were also able to use auditory cues, mirroring differences in the complexity of their wild ecology. We further found that, unlike many anthropoid species tested to date, these strepsirrhine species failed to make inferences by exclusion. These results highlight the importance of natural history in understanding the evolution of logical inference and help reconstruct the deeper phylogeny of primate cognition.",['shs']
"Evolution of preferences in structured populations: Genes, guns, and culture","During human evolution, individuals interacted mostly within small groups that were connected by limited migration and sometimes by conflicts. Which preferences, if any, will prevail in such scenarios? Building on population biology models of spatially structured populations, and assuming individuals' preferences to be their private information, we characterize those preferences that, once established, cannot be displaced by alternative preferences. We represent such uninvadable preferences in terms of fitness and in terms of material payoffs. At the fitness level, individuals can be regarded to act as if driven by a mix of self-interest and a Kantian motive that evaluates own behavior in the light of the consequences for own fitness if others adopted this behavior. This Kantian motive is borne out from (genetic or cultural) kin selection. At the material-payoff level, individuals act as if driven in part by self-interest and a Kantian motive (in terms of material payoffs), but also in part by other-regarding preferences towards other group members. This latter motive is borne out of group resource constraints and the risk of conflict with other groups. We show how group size, the migration rate, the risk of group conflicts, and cultural loyalty shape the relative strengths of these motives.",['shs']
Alexithymia and autism diagnostic assessments: evidence from twins at genetic risk of autism and adults with anorexia nervosa,"Alexithymia, a difficulty identifying and communicating one’s own emotions, affects socio-emotional processes, such as emotion recognition and empathy. Co-occurring alexithymia is prevalent in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and underlies some socio-emotional difficulties usually attributed to autism. Socio-emotional abilities are examined during behavioural diagnostic assessments of autism, yet the effect of alexithymia on these assessments is not known. This study aimed to examine the associations between alexithymia and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) assessment scores.",['shs']
Mother's social status is associated with child health in a horticulturalist population,"High social status is often associated with greater mating opportunities and fertility for men, but do women also obtain fitness benefits of high status? Greater resource access and child survivorship may be principal pathways through which social status increases women's fitness. Here, we examine whether peer-rankings of women's social status (indicated by political influence, project leadership, and respect) positively covaries with child nutritional status and health in a community of Amazonian horticulturalists. We find that maternal political influence is associated with improved child health outcomes in models adjusting for maternal age, parental height and weight, level of schooling, household income, family size, and number of kin in the community. Children of politically influential women have higher weight-for-age (B = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.12–0.54), height-for-age (B = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.10–0.54), and weight-for-height (B = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.04–0.44), and they are less likely to be diagnosed with common illnesses (OR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.31–0.76). These results are consistent with women leveraging their social status to enhance reproductive success through improvements in child health. We discuss these results in light of parental investment theory and the implications for the evolution of female social status in humans.",['shs']
Modelling cultural selection on biological fitness to integrate social transmission and adaptive explanations for human behaviour,"One of the difficulties with cultural group selection theory highlighted in the review by Smith (2020, Evol. Hum. Sci., 2, e7) is its inability to separate the evolutionary effects of selection of cultural traits based on biological fitness (Cultural Selection 1) from the effects of selection based on cultural fitness (Cultural Selection 2). Confusing these two processes can hinder the integration of adaptive explanations for human behaviour, which focus on biological fitness, and cultural evolution explanations, which often focus on social transmission. Recent empirical work is starting to bridge this gap, but progress in mathematical modelling has been considerably slower. Here, I suggest that modellers can contribute to achieving this integration by further developing models of Cultural Selection 1, where behaviours are influenced by culturally inherited traits selected on the basis of their effects on biological fitness. These models should build on existing social evolution theory methods and replace genetic relatedness with cultural relatedness, that is the probability that two individuals share a cultural variant.",['shs']

Collective Information Processing in Human Phase Separation,"Social media filters combined with recommender systems can lead to the emergence of filter bubbles and polarized groups. In addition, segregation processes of human groups in certain social contexts have been shown to share some similarities with phase separation phenomena in physics. Here, we study the impact of information filtering on collective segregation behavior. We report a series of experiments where groups of 22 subjects have to perform a collective segregation task that mimics the tendency of individuals to bond with other similar individuals. More precisely, the participants are each assigned a color (red or blue) unknown to them, and have to regroup with other subjects sharing the same color. To assist them, they are equipped with an artificial sensory device capable of detecting the majority color in their ``environment'' (defined as their k nearest neighbors, unbeknownst to them), for which we control the perception range, k=1,3,5,7,9,11,13. We study the separation dynamics (emergence of unicolor groups) and the properties of the final state, and show that the value of k controls the quality of the segregation, although the subjects are totally unaware of the precise definition of the ``environment''. We also find that there is a perception range k=7 above which the ability of the group to segregate does not improve. We introduce a model that precisely describes the random motion of a group of pedestrians in a confined space, and which faithfully reproduces and allows to interpret the results of the segregation experiments. Finally, we discuss the strong and precise analogy between our experiment and the phase separation of two immiscible materials at very low temperature.",['shs']
Kin discrimination and demography modulate patterns of sexual conflict,"Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in the overlap between kin selection and sexual selection, particularly concerning how kin selection can put the brakes on harmful sexual conflict. However, there remains a significant disconnect between theory and empirical research. Whilst empirical work has focused on kin-discriminating behaviour, theoretical models have assumed indiscriminating behaviour. Additionally, theoretical work makes particular demographic assumptions that constrain the relationship between genetic relatedness and the scale of competition, and it is not clear that these assumptions reflect the natural setting in which sexual conflict has been empirically studied. Here, we plug this gap between current theoretical and empirical understanding by developing a mathematical model of sexual conflict that incorporates kin discrimination and different patterns of dispersal. We find that kin discrimination and group dispersal inhibit harmful male behaviours at an individual level, but kin discrimination intensifies sexual conflict at the population level.",['shs']
Lane Marking Based Vehicle Localization Using Particle Filter and Multi-Kernel Estimation,"Vehicle localization is the primary information needed for advanced tasks like navigation. This information is usually provided by the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. However, the low accuracy of GPS in urban environments makes it unreliable for further treatments. The combination of GPS data and additional sensors can improve the localization precision. In this article, a marking feature based vehicle localization method is proposed, able to enhance the lo-calization performance. To this end, markings are detected using a multi-kernel estimation method from an on-vehicle camera. A particle filter is implemented to estimate the vehicle position with respect to the detected markings. Then, map-based markings are constructed according to an open source map database. Finally, vision-based markings and map-based markings are fused to obtain the improved vehicle fix. The results on road traffic scenarios using a public database show that our method leads to a clear improvement in localization accuracy.",['info']

Why Does Capital Flow to Rich States?,"The magnitude and the direction of net international capital flows do not fit neoclassical models. The fifty U.S. states comprise an integrated capital market with very low barriers to capital flows, which makes them an ideal testing ground for neoclassical models. We develop a simple frictionless open economy model with perfectly diversified ownership of capital and find that capital flows among the states are consistent with the model. Therefore, the small size and “wrong” direction of net international capital flows are likely due to frictions associated with national borders, not to inherent flaws in the neoclassical model.",['shs']
Findings from the 2014 Labor Force Survey in Sierra Leone,"Jobs are critical to poverty reduction and inclusive growth in Sierra Leone, where more than half the population is poor and most are dependent on labor earnings. The country will require substantial job creation to accommodate its young and growing population, coupled with low labor intensity in the mining sector that has been driving recent growth. Adding to this challenge is the need to improve the quality of jobs in a context where most workers are engaged in low productivity activities. Given that Sierra Leone is a post-conflict country, jobs are also central to sustained stability. Yet, despite the importance of jobs for Sierra Leone, the design of policies and interventions to promote these opportunities has been constrained by a limited knowledge base. The 2014 Labor Force Survey report seeks to contribute to solutions to the jobs challenge in Sierra Leone through a foundational analysis of the country's first dedicated labor survey in nearly three decades. The report provides an overview of the employment situation in Sierra Leone, ranging from labor force participation to the types of employment among the working-age population. Through analysis of specialized modules, the report sheds light on key constraints to self-employment in agricultural activities and non-farm household enterprises, which are, respectively, the first-and second-largest sources of jobs in the economy. It also highlights the extent of informality in both wage employment and non-farm self-employment as well as how an individual's status in the labor market relates to poverty. The report also presents information on skills levels and how basic skills are acquired by the working age population. Finally, the report discusses issues related to youth employment and the specific constraints faced by youth in gaining access to productive job opportunities.",['shs']
"Skill Biased Heterogeneous Firms, Trade Liberalization and the Skill Premium","We propose a theory that rising globalization and rising wage inequality are related because trade liberalization raises the demand facing highly competitive skill-intensive firms. In our model, only the lowest-cost firms participate in the global economy exactly along the lines of Melitz (2003). In addition to differing in their productivity, firms differ in their skill intensity. We model skill-biased technology as a correlation between skill intensity and technological acumen, and we estimate this correlation to be large using firm-level data from Chile in 1995. A fall in trade costs leads to both greater trade volumes and an increase in the relative demand for skill, as the lowest-cost/most-skilled firms expand to serve the export market while less skill-intensive non-exporters retrench in the face of increased import competition. This mechanism works regardless of factor endowment differences, so we provide an explanation for why globalization and wage inequality move together in both skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries. In our model countries are net exporters of the services of their abundant factor, but there are no Stolper-Samuelson effects because import competition affects all domestic firms equally.",['shs']
Reason-based choice and context-dependence: An explanatory framework,"We introduce a ""reason-based"" framework for explaining and predicting individual choices. The key idea is that a decision-maker focuses on some but not all properties of the options and chooses an option whose ""motivationally salient"" properties he/she most prefers. Reason-based explanations can capture two kinds of context-dependent choice: (i) the motivationally salient properties may vary across choice contexts, and (ii) they may include ""context-related"" properties, not just ""intrinsic"" properties of the options. Our framework allows us to explain boundedly rational and sophisticated choice behaviour. Since properties can be recombined in new ways, it also offers resources for predicting choices in unobserved contexts.",['shs']
Communicating on electoral platforms,"This paper proposes an analysis of strategic communication on platforms by candidates during an electoral campaign. A candidate's platform in a (possibly) multidimensional policy space is fixed, but is imperfectly known by voters. A candidate strategically decides the emphasis he puts on the various issues, and thus the precision of the information he conveys to voters on his position on each issue. We show that if voters are fully rational, then all the relevant information is revealed at equilibrium, whatever the candidate's true position. We then study a model of boundedly rational voters, who take at face value the messages sent by the politicians, without being able to decipher their strategies. If voters are boundedly rational in this sense, a politician will not transmit all the relevant information; his communication strategy will depend on both the prior in the electorate and his true positions (unknown to the electorate). In particular, we show that candidates address all issues with positive probability, but tend to talk more often on issues on which they are a priori congruent with the representative voter, thereby providing a “nuanced” version of Petrocik's “issue ownership theory”.",['shs']
Wages and Human Capital in the U.S. Financial Industry: 1909–2006,"We study the allocation and compensation of human capital in the U.S. finance industry over the past century. Across time, space, and subsectors, we find that financial deregulation is associated with skill intensity, job complexity, and high wages for finance employees. All three measures are high before 1935 and after 1980, but not in the interim period. Workers in the finance industry earn the same education-adjusted wages as other workers until 1990 and significantly more afterward. By 2006 the premium is 40% on average, and 200% for top earners and CEOs. Earnings risk and firm size effects account for some of the premium, but the majority does not appear to be sustainable.",['shs']

"LED (385, 405 and 455 nm) induced polymerization using star-shaped tris(4-(thiophen-2-yl)phenyl) amine derivatives as light harvesting photoinitiators","Two star-shaped tris(4-(thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)amine derivatives, namely tris(4-(5-(3-pentylthieno[3,2- b ]thiophen-5-yl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)amine and tris(4-(5-(3-pentyl-2-(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2- b ]thiophen-5-yl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)amine, are developed as photoinitiators for radical and cationic polymerizations under near-UV and visible light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (e.g., 385, 405, and 455 nm). When used in combination with an iodonium salt (and optionally N -vinyl carbazole) or an amine/alkyl halide couples, they lead to excellent photoinitiating abilities for the polymerization of epoxides or (meth)acrylates under air. Compared with commercial photoinitiators, i.e., camphorquinone-based systems or bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide, the novel photoinitiators exhibit noticeably higher polymerization efficiencies under air (epoxide conversions = 41–57% vs ≈0%, halogen lamp exposure; methacrylate conversions = 50–55% vs 44%, LED at 405 nm exposure; methacrylate conversions = 34–42% vs 0–8%, LED at 455 nm exposure). These systems are also interesting in overcoming oxygen inhibition.

Truxene: a promising scaffold for future materials,"Truxene (10,15-dihydro-5H-diindeno[1,2-a;1′,2′-c]fluorene), which is a heptacyclic polyarene structure, has attracted a great deal of interest due to its exceptional solubility, high thermal stability and ease with which it may be modified. Over the years and thanks to the advances in the synthesis of truxene derivatives, the scope of applications of this attractive building block, initially limited to synthesis and photoluminescence, has nowadays been extended to organic electronics.

Poly(2-(N-carbazolyl)ethyl acrylate) as a host for high efficiency polymer light-emitting devices,"Poly(2-(N-carbazolyl)ethyl acrylate), a poly(acrylate) comprised of carbazole-side groups attached via a flexible chain to the polymer backbone (PVAK) has been tested as host for solution-processed polymer light-emitting devices (PLEDs). This non-conjugated polymer proved to be an excellent candidate to host wide-bandgap phosphors. Notably, this polymer exhibited a high thermal stability (Td = 322 °C), a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 91 °C and a wide bandgap corresponding to the pendent carbazole units and the disrupted π-conjugation of the polymer main chain, making this polymeric host a suitable candidate for wide bandgap triplet emitters. When tested as a host for FIrpic and Ir(ppy)3, the resulting blue and green light-emitting devices showed a maximum luminous efficiency of 18.25 and 17.74 cd/A, respectively, which are comparable to recent reports of devices made using other carbazole-based oxygen-rich polymeric hosts.

Bis(diphenylamino)naphthalene host materials: careful selection of the substitution pattern for the design of fully solution-processed triple-layered electro-luminescent devices,"Two new triarylamine-based wide bandgap small molecules differing by the position of their substituents were investigated as hosts for solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Blue-green, green and red OLEDs were realized with FIrpic, Ir(ppy)2(acac) and Ir(ppy)2(dbm) as triplet emitters respectively and the three layers constituting the device stacking were successively deposited with orthogonal solvents. Interestingly, one of the two bis(diphenylamino)naphthalene-based compounds, (NAP-1,5-DPA), furnished significantly enhanced EL performances compared to its isomeric counterpart. A maximum luminance of 3905 cd m−2 at 21 V was notably achieved with this material for devices comprising FIrpic as dopant. To get a deeper insight into these major differences in devices, the two host materials were characterized by UV-visible absorption and luminescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Thin films of the two materials were also examined by optical and atomic force microscopy. Thermal properties of the two hosts were also investigated as well as their electronic characteristics by theoretical calculations.",['chim']
Solution-processed blue phosphorescent OLEDs with carbazole-based polymeric host materials,"A new carbazole-based polymer PEPEK varying from the previously reported PEPK by the length of the spacer between the polymer backbone and the pendent carbazole moiety was investigated as polymeric host for solution-processed devices. Interestingly, if the two polymers are structurally close since the length of the alkyl chain only differs from one carbon atom, the previously reported PEPK gave higher performances than the newly synthesized PEPEK when tested as host for the wide bandgap triplet emitter FIrpic. To optimize electroluminescence performances, two device configurations were examined. On doping the emissive layer of phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) at 16 wt% with FIrpic, best PEPK-based OLEDs gave an efficacy of 15.14 cd/A whereas PEPEK-based devices furnished an efficiency of 12.17 cd/A in the same conditions. To determine the origin of this unexpected behavior, the new polymer PEPEK was characterized by UV–visible absorption and luminescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Thermal properties of PEPEK were also examined and compared to those of PEPK.",['chim']

On the Factors Affecting the Accuracy and Robustness of Smoothed-Radial Point Interpolation Method,"In order to overcome the possible singularity associated with the Point Interpolation Method (PIM), the Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM) was proposed by G. R. Liu. Radial basis functions (RBF) was used in RPIM as basis functions for interpolation. All these radial basis functions include shape parameters. The choice of these shape parameters has been and stays a problematic theme in RBF approximation and interpolation theory. The object of this study is to contribute to the analysis of how these shape parameters affect the accuracy of the radial PIM. The RPIM is studied based on the global Galerkin weak form performed using two integration technics: classical Gaussian integration and the strain smoothing integration scheme. The numerical performance of this method is tested on their behavior on curve fitting, and on three elastic mechanical problems with regular or irregular nodes distributions. A range of recommended shape parameters is obtained from the analysis of different error indexes and also the condition number of the matrix system. All resulting RPIM methods perform very well in term of numerical computation. The Smoothed Radial Point Interpolation Method (SRPIM) shows a higher accuracy, especially in a situation of distorted node scheme.","['info', 'math', 'spi']"
Comparison of Optimized Control Strategies of a High-Speed Traction Machine with Five Phases and Bi-Harmonic Electromotive Force,"The purpose of the paper is to present the potentialities in terms of the control of a new kind of PM synchronous machine. With five phases and electromotive forces whose first (E1) and third (E3) harmonics are of similar amplitude, the studied machine, so-called bi-harmonic, has properties that are interesting for traction machine payload. With three-phase machines, supplied by a mono-harmonic sinusoidal current, the weak number of freedom degrees limits the strategy of control for traction machines especially when voltage saturation occurs at high speeds. As the torque is managed for three-phase machines by a current with only one harmonic, flux weakening is necessary to increase speed when the voltage limitation is reached. The studied five-phase machine, thanks to the increase in the number of freedom degrees for control, aims to alleviate this fact. In his paper, three optimized control strategies are compared in terms of efficiency and associated torque/speed characteristics. These strategies take into account numerous constraints either from the supply (with limited voltage) or from the machine (with limited current densities and maximum acceptable copper, iron and permanent magnet losses). The obtained results prove the wide potentialities of such a kind of five-phase bi-harmonic machine in terms of control under constraints. It is thus shown that the classical Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) strategy developed for the three-phase machine is clearly not satisfying on the whole range of speed because of the presence of iron losses whose values can no more be neglected at high speeds. Two other strategies have been then proposed to be able to manage the compromises, at high speeds, between the high values of torque and efficiency under the constraints of admissible total losses either in the rotor or in the stator.",['spi']
Study of the Influence of the Fabrication Process Imperfections on the Performances of a Claw Pole Synchronous Machine Using a Stochastic Approach,"In mass production, fabrication processes of electrical machines are not perfectly repeatable with time, leading to dispersions on the dimensions which are not equal to their nominal values. The issue is then to link the dispersions on the dimensions which are uncertain to the performances of electrical machines in order to evaluate their influence. To deal with uncertainty, there is a growing interest in the stochastic approach, which consists in modelling the uncertain parameters with random variables. In fact, this approach enables to quantify the influence of the variability of the uncertain parameters on the variability of the quantities of interest. In this paper, a stochastic approach coupled with a 3D Finite Element model is used to study the influence of the fabrication process imperfections like the rotor eccentricity and the stator deformation on the performances of a claw pole synchronous machine.",['spi']
Five-Phase Bi-Harmonic PMSM Control under Voltage and Currents Limits,"For a particular five-phase synchronous machine, this paper investigates the sensitivity of a vectorial control strategy on the required peak phase voltage whose value is fundamental for the choice of the DC bus voltage. The specificity of the machine is that the first and third harmonic components of the back electromotive force (back-emf) have the same amplitude. As a consequence, the torque can be produced by one of them or both with suitable currents. This degree of freedom is interesting for optimizing the efficiency and generating high transient torque. However, using two harmonics having the same amplitude leads to a necessity to analyze the constraints on the required phase machine voltage. Considering a Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) strategy, the paper examines the impact of some parameters such as the phase shift between currents and back-emfs or the ratio between the third and the first harmonic of current on the torque and maximum voltage value. Experimental tests with a limited DC bus voltage have been carried out and compared to the results obtained by a Finite Element Analysis.",['spi']
MMC Stored Energy Participation to the DC Bus Voltage Control in an HVDC Link,"The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is becoming a promising converter technology for HVDC transmission systems. Contrary to the conventional two- or three-level VSC-HVDC links, no capacitors are connected directly on the dc bus in an MMC-HVDC link. Therefore, in such an HVDC link, the dc bus voltage may be much more volatile than in a conventional VSC-HVDC link. In this paper, a connection between the dc bus voltage level and the stored energy inside the MMC is proposed in order to greatly improve the dynamic behavior in case of transients. EMT simulation results illustrate this interesting property on an HVDC link study case.",['spi']

The reduced model is then validated by comparing the vector potential, flux density distribution, and torque results of the original model,which indicates the capability of using the proper orthogonal decomposition method in the multi-variable input problems. The developed methodology can be used for fast simulations of the machine.",['spi']
Global Parameters Sensitivity Analysis and Development of a Two-Dimensional Real-Time Model of Proton-Exchange-Membrane Fuel Cells,"This paper presents a 2-D real-time modeling approach for a proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The proposed model covers multi-physical domains for both ﬂuidic and electrochemical features, which considers in particular the ﬂow ﬁeld geometric form of fuel cell. The characteristics of reactant gas convection in the serpentine gas pipeline and diﬀusion phenomenon through the gas diﬀusion layer (GDL) are thoroughly considered in ﬂuidic domain model. In addition, a three levels iterative solver is developed in order to accurately calculate the implicit spatial physical quantities distribution in electrochemical domain. Moreover, the proposed 2-D real-time modeling approach uses a numerical method to achieve a fast execution time, and can thus be further easily applied to any real-time control implementation or online diagnostic system. After experimental validation under diﬀerent fuel cell operating conditions, an iterative Least Angle Regression (LAR) method is used to eﬃciently and accurately perform the global parameters sensitivity analysis based on Sobol deﬁnition. The online analysis results give an insight into the inﬂuences of modeling parameters on fuel cell performance. The eﬀect of interactions between parameters’ sensitivities is especially investigated, which can provide useful in- formation for degradation understanding, parameters tuning, re-calibration of the parameters and online prognostic.",['spi']
Maximum Torque Per Ampere Strategy for a Biharmonic Five-phase Synchronous Machine,"The paper studies the impact of first and third current-harmonic repartition in a five-phase Permanent Magnet machine whose Electromotive Forces (emfs) have first and third harmonics of the same amplitude. With a five-phase machine, it is possible for the torque production to achieve independent controls of the first and third harmonics of currents by using a vector control in each one of the two characteristic orthogonal sub-spaces of the machine. The same torque quality as obtained with a three-phase machine with sinusoidal emf can be thus obtained with a non-sinusoidal emf and with one more supplementary degree of freedom for the control. Based on the Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) strategy used for three-phase machines, a comparison of the obtained torque/speed characteristics of the machine is achieved using either one or two harmonics. The voltage limits imposed by the Voltage Source Inverter and two different values of the maximum allowed current densities are taken into account for obtaining the optimum repartition between first and third harmonics of currents: it appears that at first, from the point of view of efficiency, the MTPA is not optimal except for low speeds and secondly that the repartition of currents is not trivial and depends for example on the considered maximum current densities.",['spi']
Experimental Investigation of Inverter Open-Circuit Fault Diagnosis for Bi-Harmonic Five-Phase Permanent Magnet Drive,"This paper proposes a procedure that is suitable for experimental investigation of real-time open-switch and open-phase faults diagnosis of a five-leg Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) feeding a five-phase bi-harmonic Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (5-Φ B-PMSM). The algorithm is based on the specific characteristics of multiphase machines, which allows inverter fault detection with sufficient robustness of the algorithm in the presence of fundamental and third harmonic components. Firstly, the inverter fault effects analysis is achieved in the characteristic subspaces of the five-phase PMSM. Specificities that are interesting for the elaboration of a real-time Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) process are highlighted. Original and particular algorithms are used for an accurate two-dimensional normalized fault vector extraction in a defined fault reference frame. This frame is dedicated only for fault detection and identification. To ensure the high immunity of the FDI process against transient states, a particular normalization procedure is applied. The normalized diagnostic signals are formulated from the defined frame and others variables derived from the reference and measured currents. Simulation and experimental results of open-switch and open-phase faults are provided to validate the proposed algorithm.",['spi']
Balanced Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Applied to Magnetoquasistatic Problems Through a Stabilization Methodology,"Model Order Reduction (MOR) methods are applied in different areas of physics in order to reduce the computational time of large scale systems. It has been an active field of research for many years, in mechanics especially, but it is quite recent for magnetoquasistatic problems. Although the most famous method, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has been applied for modelling many electromagnetic devices, this method can lack accuracy for low order magnitude output quantities, like flux associated with a probe in regions where the field is low. However, the Balanced Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (BPOD) is a MOR method which takes into account these output quantities in its reduced model to render them accurately. Even if the BPOD may lead to unstable reduced systems, this can be overcome by a stabilization procedure. Therefore, the POD and stabilized BPOD will be compared on a 3D linear magnetoquasistatic field problem.","['math', 'spi']"
Improving Small-Signal Stability of an MMC With CCSC by Control of the Internally Stored Energy,"The DC-side dynamics of Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) can be prone to poorly damped oscillations or stability problems when the second harmonic components of the arm currents are mitigated by a Circulating Current Suppression Controller (CCSC). This paper demonstrates that the source of these oscillations is the uncontrolled interaction of the DC-side current and the internally stored energy of the MMC, as resulting from the CCSC. Stable operation and improved performance of the MMC control system can be ensured by introducing closed loop control of the energy and the DC-side current. The presented analysis relies on a detailed state-space model of the MMC which is formulated to obtain constant variables in steady state. The resulting state-space equations can be linearized to achieve a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) model, allowing for eigenvalue analysis of the small-signal dynamics of the MMC. Participation factor analysis is utilized to identify the source of the poorly damped DC-side oscillations, and indicates the suitability of introducing control of the internal capacitor voltage or the corresponding stored energy. An MMC connected to a DC power source with an equivalent capacitance, and operated with DC voltage droop in the active power flow control, is used as an example for the presented analysis. The developed small-signal models and the improvement in small-signal dynamics achieved by introducing control of the internally stored energy are verified by time-domain simulations in comparison to an EMT simulation model of an MMC with 400 sub-modules per arm.",['spi']

Data-Driven Model Order Reduction for Magnetostatic Problem Coupled with Circuit Equations,"Among the model order reduction techniques, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has shown its efficiency to solve magnetostatic and magneto-quasistatic problems in the time domain. However, the POD is intrusive in the sense that it requires the extraction of the matrix system of the full model to build the reduced model. To avoid this extraction, nonintrusive approaches like the Data Driven (DD) methods enable to approximate the reduced model without the access to the full matrix system. In this article, the DD-POD method is applied to build a low dimensional system to solve a magnetostatic problem coupled with electric circuit equations.","['math', 'spi']"

Temperature Dependence in the Jiles–Atherton Model for Non-Oriented Electrical Steels: An Engineering Approach,"High operating temperatures modify the magnetic behavior of ferromagnetic cores which may affect the performance of electrical machines. Therefore, a temperature-dependent material model is necessary to model the electrical machine behavior more accurately during the design process. Physics-inspired hysteresis models, such as the Jiles–Atherton (JA) model, seem to be promising candidates to incorporate temperature effects and can be embedded in finite element simulations. In this paper, we have identified the JA model parameters from measurements for a temperature range experienced by non oriented electrical steels in electrical machines during their operation. Based on the analysis, a parameter reduction has been performed. The proposed approach simplifies the identification procedures by reducing the number of model parameters and does not require any additional material information, such as the Curie temperature. The resulting temperature-dependent JA model is validated against measurements, and the results are in good agreement.",['spi']
Five-phase SPM machine with electronic pole changing effect for marine propulsion,"In this paper, the possibility of designing a fivephase Surface-mounted Permanent Magnet (SPM) machine with 20 slots and 8 poles for a low power marine propulsion system is examined. Due to its particular winding and surface magnet design, the machine inherently offers an electronic pole changing effect from 3×4 pole pairs at low speed to 4 pole pairs at high speed. At high speed, in the constant power range, according to Finite Element Analysis, the Maximum Torque Per Ampere strategy appears not to be the right solution to minimize the whole machine losses (copper, iron and magnets). In particular, a strategy that favors the 4-pole rotating field at high speed allows to mitigate the magnet losses, thus limiting the risk of magnet overheating.",['spi']

"Maximum reachable torque, power and speed for five-phase SPM machine with low armature reaction","Abstract—In this paper, the study of the torque and power versus speed characteristics for a family of five-phase Surface-mounted Permanent Magnet (SPM) machine is carried out. With considering hypotheses (linear magnetic modeling, only first and third harmonic terms in the back-emf and current spectrums), an optimization problem that aims to maximize the torque for given maximum peak voltage and RMS current is formulated: the optimal torque sharing among the two virtual machines (the two dq-axis subspaces) that represent the real five-phase machine is thus calculated for any mechanical speed. For an inverter and a DC voltage sized with only considering the first harmonic of back-emf and current, the problem is solved with changing the virtual machine back-emfs and inductances ratios. With the introduction of the maximum torque/speed point, maximum power/speed point and maximum reachable speed, it can be shown that, if the inductance ratio is large enough, for given Volt-Ampere rating, the machine can produce higher torque without reducing its speed range thus meaning that the capability of the inverter to work is improved with the use of the third harmonic. This property is all the truer as the base armature reaction is large. A particular five-phase machine is sized and numerically analyzed to check this property.",['spi']

It is equivalent to artificially increase the modal electromechanical coupling factor of the electromechanical structure by both decreasing the short-circuit natural frequencies and increasing the open-circuit ones. This leads to higher values of the modal electromechanical coupling factor with respect to simple negative capacitance configurations, when the same margin from stability is considered. This technique is shown to be powerful in enhancing the control performance when associated to a simple resistive shunt, usually avoided because of its poor performances.",['spi']

Design Considerations of Five-Phase Machine with Double p/3p Polarity,"In the context of traction drives with required torque transient capabilities and a classically wide flux weakening speed range, this paper gives design considerations of a particular Double-Polarity (DP) five-phase machine. Beyond its intrinsic fault tolerance due its five phases, its specificity is the ability to develop torques of comparable values under three kinds of supply: with only first, third or both first and third sinusoidal currents. This property, due to first (E1) and third (E3) harmonic electromotive forces (emf) of comparable values, gives more degrees of freedom for the control of the machine. Unlike three-phase sinusoidal machine, flux weakening is no more the unique solution when maximum voltage is reached. Thanks to the extra degrees of freedom in this kind of machines, more possibilities for the control of the torque and current supply can be applied. At first, elements for the choice of slots/poles combination of such DP machines are given. Then, in case of an Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (IPMSM), possible adaptations of the rotor are proposed in order to bring the double p/3p polarity property. The last design criterion considered is the level of eddy-current losses, important at high frequencies. For proof of the concept effectiveness, a prototype with a five-phase fractional-slot concentrated winding of 40 slots and 16/48 poles is presented with results from experimental set-up and Finite Element modeling. A comparison with equivalent no-fault-tolerant three-phase 24 slots /16 poles machines is also carried out.",['spi']

Dual-Multiphase Motor Drives for Fault- Tolerant Applications: Power Electronic Structures and Control Strategies,"This paper analyzes two fault-tolerant dualmultiphase motor drives, a series connected topology and a standard H-bridge topology. Previous studies have shown that the series connected topology is appropriate to an aerospace application and has lower peak current in degraded mode in comparison with the H-bridge topology, which may consequently diminish the system’s weight and cost. This paper extends the study to compare different control strategies of these structures under two fault conditions: short-circuit of an inverter’s switch and an open-phase of the machine. The control strategies analyzed in this paper do not impact the fundamental current or the torque generation, but the amplitudes of some harmonics in degraded mode are expected to be narrowed down in order to reduce the inverter’s size. Some analyses of maximum voltage and peak current in degraded mode have been used for inverter dimensioning. Experimental results are shown and compared to the simulated ones to confirm the validity of this study.",['spi']

Sensitivity of a 5-phase Brushless DC machine to the 7th harmonic of the back-electromotive force,"This paper presents a vector control of a 5-phase drive composed of a 5-leg Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) supplying a permanent-magnet Brushless DC (BLDC) machine with trapezoidal waveform of the back-electromotive force (EMF). To achieve this control a Multi-machine Multi-converter model is used: the 5-phase machine is transformed into a set of two 2-phase fictitious machines which are each one controlled in a (d,q) frame as 3-phase machines with sine waveform back-EMF. In comparison with the 3-phase BLDC drives, the 5-phase ones present one particularity: a high sensitivity to the 7th harmonic of back-EMF. Experimental results show that the 7th harmonic of back-EMF, which represents only 5% of RMS back-EMF, induces high amplitude parasitic currents (29 % percent of RMS current). The model allows to explain the origin of this sensitivity and how to modify simply the control algorithm. Experimental improvements of the drive are presented.",['spi']

Comparison of DEIM and BPIM to Speed up a POD-based Nonlinear Magnetostatic Model,"Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has been successfully used to reduce the size of linear Finite Element (FE) problems, and thus the computational time associated with. When considering a nonlinear behavior law of the ferromagnetic materials, the POD is not so efficient due to the high computational cost associated to the nonlinear entries of the full FE model.

Moreover, we use a Bayesian occupancy framework with a Highly-parallelized design to obtain the occupancygrid estimations.We validate our approach using experimental results with real-world data on urban scenery.",['info']
Using additive and subtractive manufacturing technologies in a new remanufacturing strategy to produce new parts from End-of-Life parts,"Nowadays, additive manufacturing technique is considered as a technique of the third industrial revolution. The technique makes it possible to build a “real-material” part by adding materials, layer by layer, based on a CAD model. Taking into account the performances of these techniques, a new remanufacturing strategy seems possible to transform an End-of-Life (EoL) part into a new part without returning to the level of raw material. The purposes of this paper is to explore the technological feasibility of such additive manufacturing techniques for remanufacturing, and then propose the ways in order to establish a new strategy for giving a new life to EoL parts. The new parts produced are intended to be different - and have different functionalities - from the original.",['spi']
Finite capacity planning algorithm for semiconductor industry considering lots priority,"A finite capacity planning heuristic is developed for semiconductor manufacturing with high-mix low-volume production, complex processes, variable cycle times and reentrant flows characteristics. The proposed algorithm projects production lots trajectories (start and end dates) for the remaining process steps, estimates the expected load for all machines and balances the workload against bottleneck tools capacities. It takes into account lots' priorities, cycle time variability and equipment saturation. This algorithm helps plant management to define feasible target production plans. It is programmed in java, and tested on real data instances from STMicroelectronics Crolles300 production plant which allowed its assessment on the effectiveness and efficiency. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed heuristic outperforms current practices for capacity planning and opens new perspectives for the production line management.",['info']
Software Defined Platforms for Visible Light Communication: State of Art and New Possibilities,"The requirement of connected devices exponentially increases day by day as well as the bandwidth needed for novel applications. As a consequence of this, radio frequency spectrum becomes more and more crowded, thus leading to serious limitations in the diffusion of novel technologies when considering challenging environments such as hospitals and airplanes, where EM interferences are particularly unwanted. The integration of Visible Light Communication (VLC) in the existing infrastructures could provide a valid tool to address these issues. In this context, Software Defined concepts could significantly simplify the integration process, leading to the development of low cost and flexible architectures. To this end, Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), designed and commercialized by Ettus Company and National Instruments, is emerging as a comparatively low cost hardware platform for software defined architectures, allowing rapid prototyping and test bed validations. The aim of the present work is to exploit the current literature in the framework of Software Defined Systems based on USRP platform for VLC purposes, while briefly highlighting some useful potentialities for the development of solid and flexible architectures.",['scco']
A Survey on Vehicular Social Networks,"This article surveys recent literature on Vehicular Social Networks that are a particular class of vehicular ad hoc networks, characterized by social aspects and features. Starting from this pillar, we investigate perspectives of next generation vehicles under the assumption of social networking for vehicular applications (i.e., safety and entertainment applications). This paper plays a role as a starting point about socially-inspired vehicles, and main related applications, as well as communication techniques. Vehicular communications can be considered as the “first social network for automobiles”, since each driver can share data with other neighbors. As an instance, heavy traffic is a common occurrence in some areas on the roads (e.g., at intersections, taxi loading/unloading areas, and so on); as a consequence, roads become a popular social place for vehicles to connect to each other. Human factors are then involved in vehicular ad hoc networks, not only due to the safety related applications, but also for entertainment purpose. Social characteristics and human behavior largely impact on vehicular ad hoc networks, and this arises to the vehicular social networks, which are formed when vehicles (individuals) “socialize” and share common interests. In this paper, we provide a survey on main features of vehicular social networks, from novel emerging technologies to social aspects used for mobile applications, as well as main issues and challenges. Vehicular social networks are described as decentralized opportunistic communication networks formed among vehicles. They exploit mobility aspects, and basics of traditional social networks, in order to create novel approaches of message exchange through the detection of dynamic social structures. An overview of the main state-of-the-art on safety and entertainment applications relying on social networking solutions is also provided.",['scco']

Modeling and Experimental Analysis of an In-body Area Nanonetwork,"Nanotechnology is gaining more and more consensus in several application fields, comprised in-body applications. Innovative therapies and diagnostic approaches are based on the use of injections or oral delivery of nanoparticles. The acceleration of this type of development makes very urgent a deeply and accurate analysis of the interaction between the nanoparticles and the biological fluid where the nanoparti-cles are immersed. In this paper, we focus on Titanium (T i and its alloy (e.g., T iO2) systems, given their specific features in terms of density, lack of cytotoxic effects, etc.. Specifically, we design and study an in-body system by characterizing the emission and diffusion processes. Further, we propose an experimental study of the morphology and other important characteristics (e.g. the pH of the particles, and the dielectric constant of the solution) of nano-T iO2 systems when immersed in a Ringer solution, in order to derive important information related to their potential toxicity inside the human body.",['info']
"Démocratie, situations ""exceptionnelles"" et militarisation de l'espace public","Depuis les attentats de Charlie Hebdo et de l’hypercasher à Paris en janvier 2015, et dans la foulée du démantèlement d’une cellule terroriste à Verviers, le gouver - nement belge a pris la décision de déployer des militaires dans les rues du pays.

Increasing O-GlcNAcylation level on organ culture of soleus modulates the calcium activation parameters of muscle fibers.,"O-N-acetylglucosaminylation is a reversible post-translational modification which presents a dynamic and highly regulated interplay with phosphorylation. New insights suggest that O-GlcNAcylation might be involved in striated muscle physiology, in particular in contractile properties such as the calcium activation parameters. By the inhibition of O-GlcNAcase, we investigated the effect of the increase of soleus O-GlcNAcylation level on the contractile properties by establishing T/pCa relationships. We increased the O-GlcNAcylation level on soleus biopsies performing an organ culture of soleus treated or not with PUGNAc or Thiamet-G, two O-GlcNAcase inhibitors. The enhancement of O-GlcNAcylation pattern was associated with an increase of calcium affinity on slow soleus skinned fibers. Analysis of the glycoproteins pattern showed that this effect is solely due to O-GlcNAcylation of proteins extracted from skinned biopsies. We also characterized the O-GlcNAcylated contractile proteins using a proteomic approach, and identified among others troponin T and I as being O-GlcNAc modified. We quantified the variation of O-GlcNAc level on all these identified proteins, and showed that several regulatory contractile proteins, predominantly fast isoforms, presented a drastic increase in their O-GlcNAc level. Since the only slow isoform of contractile protein presenting an increase of O-GlcNAc level was MLC2, the effect of enhanced O-GlcNAcylation pattern on calcium activation parameters could involve the O-GlcNAcylation of sMLC2, without excluding that an unidentified O-GlcNAc proteins, such as TnC, could be potentially involved in this mechanism. All these data strongly linked O-GlcNAcylation to the modulation of contractile activity of skeletal muscle.",['sdv']

"Groundwater management of a highly dynamic karst by assessing baseflow and quickflow with a rainfall-discharge model (Dardennes springs, SE France)Gestion des eaux souterraines d’un karst hyper dynamique par l’évaluation du débit de base et du débit rapide avec un modèle Pluie-Débit (sources de Dardennes, SE France).","This paper aims at characterizing the groundwater flow in a highly dynamic karst aquifer using a global modeling approach based on rainfall and spring discharge time series. The Dardennes aquifer (SE France) was studied as it is used for drinking water supply and it also produces karst flash floods that increase the flood hazard downstream in urban areas. Three years of data were available, including a normal rainy year, a wet year and a dry year. Modeling was performed with the new platform KarstMod, a rainfall-discharge model with calibration tools. The Dardennes aquifer model was structured with three interconnected reservoirs: Epikarst, Matrix, and Conduit. Using this modeling approach, we were able to determine the groundwater hydrograph separation of the karst spring discharge, at the annual scale and at the event scale (flood). This gives insight into the low flow (Matrix) available for the drinking water demand and the fast flow (Conduit) that generates flash floods. In such a dynamic aquifer, part of the water budget cannot be accounted for by water resources as fast flow is not stored within the aquifer and is not available for the drinking water demand. The results were compared with the current groundwater management to determine whether the withdrawal is sustainable. Depending on whether it is a wet or a dry year, the proportion of slow flow ranges from 27 to 61% of the total discharge, respectively. During floods in high water periods, the proportion of quickflow increases drastically up to more than 90% of the spring discharge. In the case of a 300 mm/d simulated Mediterranean rainfall event, the mean daily peak value may reach 74 m3/s. This discharge can be reduced if the aquifer is previously depleted, which increases the storage within the aquifer. Coupling the geological context and the model results opens up future perspectives for the active management of the karst aquifer.Cet article a pour but de caractériser l’écoulement d’eau souterraine à travers un aquifère karstique fortement dynamique en utilisant une approche de modélisation globale basée sur les séries temporelles des précipitations et des débits. L’aquifère de Dardennes (SE de la France) est pris comme cas d’étude car il est d’une part utilisé pour l’alimentation en eau potable et d’autre part il génère des crues éclair karstiques qui augmentent le risque inondation en aval, en zone urbaine. Trois années de données sont disponibles, incluant une année pluvieuse normale, une année très pluvieuse et une année sèche. La modélisation est réalisée avec la nouvelle plateforme KarstMod, un modèle à réservoirs pluie-débit avec des outils de calage automatique. Le modèle de l’aquifère de Dardennes est structuré avec trois réservoirs interconnectés : Epikarst, Matrice et Conduit. Grâce à cette approche de modélisation, nous avons effectué une déconvolution du débit des sources, à l’échelle annuelle et à l’échelle des événements de crue. Cela permet de séparer le débit de base (Matrice) disponible pour les besoins en eau potable et l’écoulement rapide (Conduit) qui génère des crues éclairs. Dans les systèmes hyper-dynamiques, une partie de l’eau qui transite ne peut pas être comptabilisée comme ressource en eau car l’écoulement rapide n’est pas stocké dans l’aquifère et n’est donc pas disponible pour alimenter la demande en eau potable. Les résultats sont comparés avec la gestion actuelle des eaux souterraines afin de montrer si l’exploitation de l’eau est durable. Selon l’année, la proportion de débit de base varie entre 27 et 61 % du débit total, respectivement selon une année pluvieuse ou sèche. Lors des crues en période de hautes-eaux, la proportion du débit rapide augmente considérablement jusqu’à plus de 90 % du débit total des sources. Dans le cas d’un événement pluvieux de type Méditerranéen avec 300 mm/j de pluie, le débit moyen maximum simulé avec le modèle atteint 74 m3/s. Ce débit peut être réduit si l’aquifère est déjà déprimé, ce qui augmente le stockage de l’eau. Le couplage du contexte géologique et des résultats du modèle ouvre une perspective future pour une gestion active de cet aquifère karstique.",['phys']
Atypical phonological processing impairs written word recognition in children with cochlear implants,"Children equipped with cochlear implant (CI) do not achieve similar levels of word recognition as typical hearing (TH)children, but it is unclear whether the reading deficit results from less accurate phonological representations, atypicalreading procedures, or both. Phonological representations are crucial for reading acquisition in an alphabetic writingsystem, but CI users learn to read without having achieved the same level of speech perception as TH children. In thisbehavioural study, we addressed whether word reading in children using a CI (n = 25) is as strongly anchored inphonological operations as in TH children, matched for both chronological age (n = 25) and reading experience (n = 25).Using auditory phoneme perception tasks, we confirmed that children with a CI performed less accurately than TH children.When further tested for visual word recognition, CI users applied the same basic reading procedure as TH children, i.e.,they read pseudowords through phonological decoding and irregular words through orthographic coding. Finally, using avisual lexical task where subjects had to decide whether pseudowords were or not real words, we observed that CI usersrejected word homophones as accurately as TH children, but performed less well than TH controls for rejecting nonhomophonespseudowords. Preserved performance for homophones but not for non-homophones relative to controlssuggests that children using a CI compensate for defective phonological processing by relying on lexical representations.Altogether, this series of studies allows us to propose that the reading operations in children with a CI are similar in natureas in TH children, yet constrained by less reliable phonological representations.",['scco']

Underpinning Intercultural Competence within a Context-Effect Didactic Method,"Modern learning approaches and teaching methods put a special emphasis on unleashing each student's innovative and creative potential. On the grounds that children need to become actors of their own active learning (Piaget, 1958, Bonwell et al., 1991), new pedagogies for science education are being developed alongside technologies (Scott CL, 2015). Arguably, in the knowledge-based era that we live in, the understanding of cultural diversity is highly considered as a core value and a driving force for innovation (Bouncken et al., 2016). In this regard, the project TEEC (Educational Technologies for Teaching in Context - Technologies Éducatives pour l' Enseignement en Contexte, funded by the program ANR-FRQSC) lays the groundwork for designing a context effects based learning approach, determined by the socio-cultural factors that influence one’s learning, which fosters collaboration among students in Guadeloupe and Quebec. Within the framework of TEEC, synchronous and asynchronous technologies are being combined with authentic learning situations (Newmann et al., 1995), in order to observe children’s understanding on different scientific objects in different disciplines: geothermal energy, sustainable development, linguistics, socio-history. This work outlines preliminary findings on two TEEC’s in-situ experimentations, more specifically one focusing on sustainable development (object of study: sugarcane/maple syrup) and the other one on linguistics (object of study: folktales of Antilles/Québec). These specific topics, which embody a high sense of didactic interest, are of fundamental importance for both territories especially in dimensions such as society, culture and economy. In the first case, sugarcane is a core reference point in Guadeloupe, while maple syrup is a prominent element of Québec’s culture. Our participants, elementary school students, undertook research investigations in their context, at then collaborated with their peers to draw conclusions on the notion, the existence and the manufacturing process of sugar. In the second case, folktales of Antilles and of Quebec are of different nature and follow different structure patterns. Students of primary school in Guadeloupe worked on a creole folktale entitled “Compère Zamba voulait tromper Compère Lapin” (Benzo, 2000) while the students of Quebec worked on a traditional folktale entitled “Rose Latulipe” (Aubert de Gaspé, 2006). During their research investigations, students improved their knowledge on folk literature and developed diverse conceptions around different specificities of the folktales. Their final production in collaboration was a common tale including elements from both regions. After the completion of these experimentations, participants -children aged 10-12 years old- were asked to note the cultural context elements that they have encountered and retained from their exchanges with their peers. The evidence draws from their answers to their post-tests, by which is feasible to identify some facts that impressed them the most regarding their peers, their cultural exchange experiences and those two various contexts.",['shs']
Design Method for the Minimization of CM Inductor Volume with Consideration of Core Saturation in EMI Filters,"EMI filters are necessary in many applications in order to meet EMC standards, which significantly increase overall cost and volume mainly because of the common-mode choke. In this paper, a new method to calculate the minimum volume of the inductor is proposed. It takes into account core saturation issues that may greatly impact inductor volume. Consequently, it is shown that in some cases, increasing the inductance up to an optimal value can significantly reduce the filter volume in addition to further enhancing filter attenuation. Besides, determination of the filter resonance frequency with nano crystalline material is worked out to support the analysis.",['spi']

Nonlinear damping models for linear conservative mechanical systems with preserved eigenspaces: a port-Hamiltonian formulation,"This paper addresses the derivation of a class of phenomenological but physically-grounded linear and nonlinear damping models, which preserve the eigenspaces of conservative linear mechanical problems.

These passive systems are recast in the port-Hamiltonian framework and generalized to the case of infinite dimensional systems.

They can be used to provide sounds of wooden or metallic type (such as xylophone or glockenspiel) and some interpolated versions.",['spi']
TbISWI regulates multiple polymerase I (Pol I)-transcribed loci and is present at Pol II transcription boundaries in Trypanosoma brucei,"The unicellular eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei is unusual in having very little transcriptional control. The bulk of the T. brucei genome is constitutively transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) as extensive polycistronic transcription units. Exceptions to this rule include several RNA Pol I transcription units such as the VSG expression sites (ESs), which are mono-allelically expressed. TbISWI, a member of the SWI2/SNF2 related chromatin remodeling ATPases, plays a role in repression of Pol I-transcribed ESs in both bloodstream- and procyclic-form T. brucei. We show that TbISWI binds both active and silent ESs but is depleted from the ES promoters themselves. TbISWI knockdown results in an increase in VSG transcripts from the silent VSG ESs. In addition to its role in the repression of the silent ESs, TbISWI also contributes to the downregulation of the Pol I-transcribed procyclin loci, as well as nontranscribed VSG basic copy arrays and minichromosomes. We also show that TbISWI is enriched at a number of strand switch regions which form the boundaries between Pol II transcription units. These strand switch regions are the presumed sites of Pol II transcription initiation and termination and are enriched in modified histones and histone variants. Our results indicate that TbISWI is a versatile chromatin remodeler that regulates transcription at multiple Pol I loci and is particularly abundant at many Pol II transcription boundaries in T. brucei.",['sdv']
A portable expression resource for engineering cross-species genetic circuits and pathways,"Genetic circuits and metabolic pathways can be reengineered to allow organisms to process signals and manufacture useful chemicals. However, their functions currently rely on organism-specific regulatory parts, fragmenting synthetic biology and metabolic engineering into host-specific domains. To unify efforts, here we have engineered a cross-species expression resource that enables circuits and pathways to reuse the same genetic parts, while functioning similarly across diverse organisms. Our engineered system combines mixed feedback control loops and cross-species translation signals to autonomously self-regulate expression of an orthogonal polymerase without host-specific promoters, achieving nontoxic and tuneable gene expression in diverse Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Combining 50 characterized system variants with mechanistic modelling, we show how the cross-species expression resource's dynamics, capacity and toxicity are controlled by the control loops' architecture and feedback strengths. We also demonstrate one application of the resource by reusing the same genetic parts to express a biosynthesis pathway in both model and non-model hosts.",['sdv']

Geomorphology of the Puerto Rico Trench and Cayman Trough in the Context of the Geological Evolution of the Caribbean SeaGeomorfologia Rowu Puerto Rico i Rowu Kajmańskiego w kontekście ewolucji geologicznej Morza Karaibskiego,"This paper concerns the Caribbean Sea submarine geomorphology and bathymetry and especially the Puerto Rico Trench and the Cayman Trough, using thematic mapping, geomorphological modelling and statistical analysis. The technical tools include Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) cartographic scripting toolset. The data include GEBCO digital bathymetric model in grid format, geopotential model of the Earth's gravity field EGM2008, marine free-air Faye gravity anomalies from a combined GEOS3/SEASAT/GEOSAT altimeter data set, sediment thickness from the GlobSed 5-arc-minute grid model and vector layers of GMT (coastlines, river network, borders). The cross-sectioning was done by the ""grdtrack"" module. Differences between the form of the Puerto Rico Trench and Cayman Trough presumably result from different structure and geological evolution. The geomorphology of the segment of the Puerto Rico Trench (67.5°W and 19.90°N to 64.1°W and 19.82°N) has a gentle curvature of the slope in plane (about 13° slope steepness). The slopes are steeper in the northern part (about 32°) but higher on the continental slope. The profiles of the Puerto Rico Trench are asymmetric due to the tectonic factors. The seabed of the Cayman Trough is fl at at the segment (80.0°W and 17.7°N to 78.5°W and 19.5°N). Its profile is asymmetric: northern part is steep (about 57°), southern part is about 16°. A very large negative Faye free-air gravity anomaly (up to-380 mGal) is seen in the Puerto Rico Trench, south of Cuba as well as in the northeastern part of the Cayman Trough. The tectonic plate subduction in the Lesser Antilles, Central America and seafloor spreading is reflected in the morphostructure in the Cayman Trough and Puerto Rico Trench. Modeled cross-sectioning profiles show differences both for the Trench and Trough. In contrast with the Puerto Rico Trench with distinct density peak (680 samples for depths-5,200 to-5,400 m), the Cayman Trough has a bimodal data distribution: two peaks correspond to the two intervals: 1)-3,250 m to-1,000 m; and 2)-5,250 to-3,500. The paper contributes to Caribbean Sea geological studies by using GMT for geomorphological modelling.W artykule opisano badania wybranych elementów rzeźby dna Morza Karaibskiego na tle budowy geologicznej, tektoniki oraz wybranych właściwości pola geofizycznego wpływające- go na powstawanie rowów głębinowych.

Profile Rowu Puerto Rico są asymetryczne dla obu boków z powodu uskoków i ruchów tektonicznych płyty karaibskiej i płyty północnoamerykańskiej.

Analysis of the Impact of Impulsive Noise Parameters on BER Performance of OFDM Power-Line Communications,"It is well known that asynchronous impulsive noise is the main source of distortion that drastically affects the power-line communications (PLC) performance. Recently, more realistic models have been proposed in the literature which better fit the physical properties of real impulsive noise. In this paper, we consider a pulse train model and propose a thorough analysis of the impact of impulsive noise parameters, namely impulse width and amplitude as well as inter-arrival time, on the bit error rate (BER) performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) broadband PLC. A comparison with the conventional Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) impulsive noise model exhibits the difference between the two approaches, showing the necessity of more realistic models.","['info', 'spi']"
Nudging Acceptability for Wood Ash Recycling in Forests: A Choice Experiment,"In this paper, our objective is to assess the general French population's acceptability of application of wood ash in forests, a measure currently not allowed but under consideration by the government. The main originality of our approach is that we test how a nudge can be used as an instrument to increase social acceptability, conveying objective information regarding ash recycling. Furthermore, although we do not consider it as a welfare measure, we show how the estimation of the willingness-to-pay can be considered as a complement to the more traditional social acceptability measure. Three nudges were introduced as three treatments in a discrete choice experiment. In the first treatment, the options with wood ash application were highlighted to indicate to the respondents that they corresponded to pro-environmental measures (positive framing). In the second treatment, we changed the wording of the two non-status quo options to highlight the recycling aspect of wood ash application. In the last treatment, we adopted a productive wording to highlight the fact that wood ash application increases wood production. Treatments, in particular positive framing and productive wording, influence the willingness-to-pay but depend on the attitudes of the respondents.",['shs']

Strain rate effects on localized necking in substrate-supported metal layers,"Due to their good mechanical and technological performances, thin substrate-supported metal layers are increasingly used as functional components in flexible electronic devices. Consequently, the prediction of necking, and the associated limit strains, for such components is of major academic and industrial importance. The current contribution aims to numerically investigate the respective and combined effects of strain rate sensitivity of the metal layer and the addition of an elastomer layer on localized necking in substrate-supported metal layers. To this end, strain ratedependent forms for the flow theory of plasticity and the deformation theory counterpart are used to describe the mechanical behavior of the metal layer. As to the substrate layer, it is made of elastomer material whose mechanical response is described by a neo-Hookean hyperelastic model. The two layers are assumed to be perfectly adhered. Necking limit strains are predicted by the Marciniak–Kuczynski (M–K) imperfection approach. Various numerical results, corresponding to freestanding metal layers as well as substrate-supported metal layers, are presented and extensively discussed in this paper. The significant effect of strain rate sensitivity on the retardation of localized necking is first emphasized. Then, the combined and positive influence of strain rate sensitivity of the metal layer and characteristics of the elastomer layer (thickness and stiffness) on the enhancement of the ductility of the whole bilayer is analyzed and discussed.",['spi']
Prediction of Plastic Instability in Sheet Metals During Forming Processes Using the Loss of Ellipticity Approach,"The prediction of plastic instability in sheet metals during forming processes represents nowadays an ambitious challenge. To reach this goal, a new numerical approach, based on the loss of ellipticity criterion, is proposed in the present contribution. A polycrystalline model is implemented as a user-material subroutine into the ABAQUS/Implicit finite element (FE) code. The polycrystalline constitutive model is assigned to each integration point of the FE mesh. To derive the mechanical behavior of this polycrystalline aggregate from the behavior of its microscopic constituents, the multiscale self-consistent scheme is used. The mechanical behavior of the single crystals is described by a finite strain rateindependent constitutive framework, where the Schmid law is used to model the plastic flow. The condition of loss of ellipticity at the macroscale is used as plastic instability criterion in the FE modeling. This numerical approach, which couples the FE method with the self-consistent scheme, is used to simulate a deep drawing process, and the above criterion is used to predict the formability limit of the studied sheets during this operation.",['spi']
The Committee on World Food Security: moving the reform forward,"I n a context characterized by a large spectrum of international responses to the dramatic 2007-2008 food crisis, the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) embarked upon an ambitious reform in October 2009. While recognizing that the CFS reform is an ongoing process not yet fully completed, this policy brief might be used as a contribution in order not to narrow down any evaluation effort of this mechanism and to diversify the types of expectations and outcomes to be evaluated. Drawing attention on the critical issues to ensure the full development of the reform appears necessary while "" the Committee is ready for the next step "" , according to Gerda Ver-burg, the new CFS Chair. Recommendations m Any attempt at evaluating the CFS reform should take into account the diversity of outputs and outcomes it generated. m Defining the criteria and processes in order to prepare the conditions for a proper evaluation of the CFS reform needs to be discussed through a relevant participatory process. m Considering the CFS as a policy formation process will help identifying critical steps where there are margins of progress to move the reform forward. m The role of the HLPE has to be considered as of a strategic nature, in so far as knowledge production ensured in the CFS has a key role to play in advocating for changes in current policies. It is therefore necessary to strengthen HLPE's institutional capacities. m Considering diversity of knowledge systems and approaches rather than focusing on credential diversity in terms of scientific expertise is necessary to promote a more complete coverage of the complex issues studied by the HLPE. m Adjusting CFS guidelines for implementation in national context and monitoring locally the effects of the CFS workstream with specific indicators for each region is key to ensure continued engagement by local civil society organisations. m Capacity building of local civil society organisations is needed in order for them to stay involved in the processes and interact with enough expertise with other larger organisations.

Semantic Indexing of French Biomedical Data Resources,"The volume of data in biomedicine is constantly increasing. Despite a large adoption of English in science, a significant quantity of these data uses the French language. Biomedical data integration and semantic interoperability is necessary to enable new scientific discoveries that could be made by merging different available data. The community has turned to ontologies and terminologies to design semantic indexes of data that leverage the medical knowledge. However, besides the existence of various English tools, there are considerably less ontologies available in French and there is a strong lack of related tools and services to exploit them. This lack does not match the huge amount of biomedical data produced in French, especially in the clinical world (e.g., electronic health records). SIFR investigates the scientific and technical challenges in building ontology-based services to leverage biomedical ontologies and terminologies in indexing, mining and retrieval of French biomedical data (Figure 1). Within the project, we work on several research questions from semantic indexing, text mining, terminology extraction, ontology enrichment, disambiguation, ontology alignment, multilingualism in ontologies and semantic annotation in order to offer the community with services and applications capable of leveraging the use of biomedical ontologies in their data workflows.",['info']

Density and Mobility-driven Evaluation of Broadcast Algorithms for MANETs,"Broadcast is a fundamental operation in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs). A large variety of broadcast algorithms have been proposed. They differ in the way message forwarding between nodes is controlled, and in the level of information about the topology that this control requires. Deployment scenarios for MANETs vary widely, in particular in terms of nodes density and mobility. The choice of an algorithm depends on its expected coverage and energy cost, which are both impacted by the deployment context. In this work, we are interested in the comprehensive comparison of the costs and effectiveness of broadcast algorithms for MANETs depending on target environmental conditions. We describe the results of an experimental study of five algorithms, representative of the main design alternatives. Our study reveals that the best algorithm for a given situation, such as a high density and a stable network, is not necessarily the most appropriate for a different situation such as a sparse and mobile network. We identify the algorithms characteristics that are correlated with these differences and discuss the pros and cons of each design.",['info']
Satisfiability of XPath on data trees,"This is a survey on the satisfiability problem for XPath on data trees. Data trees are finite trees whose every node carries a label from a finite alphabet and a data value from an infinite domain.

However, various fragments of XPath have decidable satisfiability problem, these are fragments defined in terms of the navigational axes which are allowed. We explore the state of the art in terms of decidability and discuss briefly some of the algorithmic techniques involved.",['info']

Fingerprinting Northeast Atlantic water masses using Neodymium isotopes,"Dissolved neodymium (Nd) isotopic composition (expressed as εNd) has been analysed for 82 seawater samples collected from 13 stations stretching from the Alboran Sea to the Iceland Basin. The distribution of the εNd values of water masses was thus investigated for the first time along the western European margin in order to explore whether the water masses flowing in the eastern subpolar and subtropical Atlantic reveal distinct isotopic patterns. The Modified Atlantic Water (MAW) in the Alboran Sea displays εNd values (between -9.2±0.2 and -8.9±0.2) that are significantly more radiogenic than those reported in previous studies (-10.8±0.2 to -9.7±0.2), suggesting temporal variations in the Nd isotopic composition of the water that enters the Mediterranean Sea from the Strait of Gibraltar. The εNd value of the underlying modified Winter Intermediate Water (WIW) has been established for the first time (-9.8±0.3) and is compatible with a Nd signature acquired from the sinking of MAW in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Within the Gulf of Cádiz, southern Mediterranean Sea Water (MSW) (-10.6±0.2) differs slightly from the northern MSW (-9.9±0.4) owing to a significant contribution of modified East Antarctic Intermediate Water (EAAIW) (-10.9±0.2). In the northeast Atlantic, the North Atlantic Current surface water located in the inter-gyre region (north of 46°N) displays εNd values of between -14.0±0.3 and -15.1±0.3, reflecting the subpolar gyre signature. Along the western European margin, εNd values of surface water decrease toward the north (from -10.4±1.6 to -13.7±1.0) in agreement with the gradual mixing between subtropical and subpolar water. At intermediate depth, εNd values decrease from -9.9±0.4 within the Gulf of Cádiz to -12.1±0.3 within the Porcupine Seabight, indicating a strong dilution of the MSW with subpolar water. Within the Rockall Trough and the Iceland Basin, the more negative εNd values at mid-depth (< -13.5±0.3) indicate that the MSW has no influence, even during periods of low NAO index. Water masses deeper than 1200 m in the northeast Atlantic are clearly influenced by the less radiogenic Labrador Sea Water (LSW) (-13.2±0.3 and -14.5±0.3) that mixes locally (εNd between -10.3±0.2 and -11.3±0.3) in the Iceland basin with the Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW).",['phys']

The Use of Chitooligosaccharides in Cryopreservation: Discussion of Concept and First Answers from DSC Thermal Analysis,"The use of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me 2 SO) as a cryoprotectant agent (CPA) is controversial. Indeed, this cryoprotectant agent (CPA) is cytotoxic and potentially mutagenic. Therefore, other cryoprotectants must be used to reduce the proportion of Me 2 SO in slow-freezing solutions. In this chapter, we propose to present the first evaluation of new non-penetrating cryoprotectants: the chitooligosaccharides (COS). These molecules are chitosan oligomers, which are biocompatible, antioxi-dant, and bacteriostatic. We first review the use of saccharides through cryopreser-vation processes. We question the possibility to reduce penetrating CPA during slow-freezing procedures. We propose to use COS as extracellular CPA to reduce the use of Me 2 SO. We question the biocompatibility of COS on mouse embryos through the analysis of the cells' development. Next, we evaluate these molecules in slow-freezing solutions with a reduced quantity of Me 2 SO. Our experimental approach is a physical method often used to characterize slow-freezing solutions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) allows to evaluate the crystallization and melting processes, the amount of crystallized water, and the equilibrium temperature and consequently to evaluate the impact of different cryoprotectants. This study gives a better understanding on how slow-freezing protocols could be improved with extracellular CPA.","['sdv', 'chim', 'phys']"

Selection and Combination of Heterogeneous Mappings to Enhance Biomedical Ontology Matching,"This paper presents a novel background knowledge approach which selects and combines existing mappings from a given biomedical ontology repository to improve ontology alignment. Current background knowledge approaches usually select either manually or automatically a limited number of different ontologies and use them as a whole for background knowledge. Whereas in our approach, we propose to pick up only relevant concepts and relevant existing mappings linking these concepts all together in a specific and customized background knowledge graph. Paths within this graph will help to discover new mappings. We have implemented and evaluated our approach using the content of the NCBO BioPortal repository and the Anatomy benchmark from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. We used the mapping gain measure to assess how much our final background knowledge graph improves results of state-of-the-art alignment systems. Furthermore, the evaluation shows that our approach produces a high quality alignment and discovers map-pings that have not been found by state-of-the-art systems.",['info']

Multilingual Mapping Reconciliation between English-French Biomedical Ontologies,"Even if multilingual ontologies are now more common, for historical reasons, in the biomedical domain, many ontologies or terminologies have been translated from one natural language to another resulting in two potentially aligned ontologies but with their own specificity (e.g., format, developers, and versions). Most often, there is no formal representation of the translation links between translated ontologies and original ones and those mappings are not formally available as linked data. However, these mappings are very important for the interoperability and the integration of multilingual biomedical data. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent translation mappings between ontologies based on the NCBO BioPortal format. We have reconciled more than 228K mappings between ten English ontologies hosted on NCBO BioPortal and their French translations. Then, we have stored both the translated ontologies and mappings on a French customized version of the platform, called the SIFR BioPortal, making the whole thing available in RDF. Reconciling the mappings turned more complex than expected because the translations are rarely exactly the same than the original ontologies as discussed in this paper.",['info']

Computationally efficient predictions of crystal plasticity based forming limit diagrams using a spectral database,"The present investigation focuses on the development of a fast and robust numerical tool for the prediction of the forming limit diagrams (FLDs) for thin polycrystalline metal sheets using a Taylor-type (full constraints) crystal plasticity model. The incipience of localized necking is numerically determined by the well-known Marciniak–Kuczynski model. The crystal plasticity constitutive equations, on which these computations are based, are known to be highly nonlinear, thus involving computationally very expensive solutions. This presents a major impediment to the wider adoption of crystal plasticity theories in the computation of FLDs. In this work, this limitation is addressed by using a recently developed spectral database approach based on discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs). Significant improvements were made to the prior approach and a new database was created to address this challenge successfully. These extensions are detailed in the present paper. It is shown that the use of the database allows a significant reduction in the computational cost involved in crystal plasticity based FLD predictions (a reduction of about 96% in terms of CPU time).",['spi']

The tutorial is primarily aimed at MS and PhD students seeking to improve their experiment practices, but more senior attendants may also find it interesting.",['info']
Convexity in partial cubes: the Hull number,"We prove that the combinatorial optimization problem of determining the hull number of a partial cube is NP-complete. This makes partial cubes the minimal graph class for which NP-completeness of this problem is known and improves earlier results in the literature. On the other hand we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to determine the hull number of planar partial cube quadrangulations. Instances of the hull number problem for partial cubes described include poset dimension and hitting sets for interiors of curves in the plane. To obtain the above results, we investigate convexity in partial cubes and obtain a new characterization of these graphs in terms of their lattice of convex subgraphs. This refines a theorem of Handa. Furthermore we provide a topological representation theorem for planar partial cubes, generalizing a result of Fukuda and Handa about tope graphs of rank 3 oriented matroids.",['math']

An empirical evaluation of free BEM solvers for M/EEG forward modeling,"Neuroimaging with magneto and electroencephalography (M/EEG) requires to compute the forward problem. It consists in predicting what is measured by MEG or EEG sensors due to a configuration of current generators within the head. When considering realistic head models, the equations derived from Maxwell equations can only be solved numerically. The Boundary Element Method is a standard approach to address this problem. However, different mathematical and computational variants exist within this class of BEM solvers. At least two BEM formulations exist for M/EEG forward modeling [Geselowitz 1967, Kybic et al. 2005]. Also implementation details vary between the different software packages (e.g. the precision of the numerical integrations). In order to investigate the influence of such differences, we have conducted a numerical experiment that evaluates the precision of different freely available BEM solvers. The BEM solvers are tested for EEG forward modeling with head models consisting of three nested shells. Multiple dipoles are located at different distances from the inner shell supposed to model the inner skull. To quantify the precision of the solvers we consider sphere models for which analytical solutions exist. Random sphere models are obtained by triangulating points randomly sampled over the spheres. We test and compare the accuracy of the BEM solvers on multiple random sphere models with different numbers of vertices on each interface. We also provide the computation times of the different solvers. The implementations tested are: OpenMEEG, SimBio [Zanow et al. 1995], Helsinki BEM [Stenroos et al. 2007], Dipoli [Oostendorp et al. 1989] and BEMCP [Phillips 2000] (Dipoli and BEMCP are available via Fieldtrip or SPM). Results show that OpenMEEG provides the best accuracy, followed by SimBio and dipoli which give comparable results. Finally, BEMCP and Helsinki BEM provide rather limited precisions.",['info']

A Task-based Taxonomy of Cognitive Biases for Information Visualization,"Information visualization designers strive to design data displays that allow for efficient exploration, analysis, and communication of patterns in data, leading to informed decisions. Unfortunately, human judgment and decision making are imperfect and often plagued by cognitive biases. There is limited empirical research documenting how these biases affect visual data analysis activities. Existing taxonomies are organized by cognitive theories that are hard to associate with visualization tasks. Based on a survey of the literature we propose a task-based taxonomy of 154 cognitive biases organized in 7 main categories. We hope the taxonomy will help visualization researchers relate their design to the corresponding possible biases, and lead to new research that detects and addresses biased judgment and decision making in data visualization.","['scco', 'info']"
Infinite Games Specified by 2-Tape Automata,"We prove that the determinacy of Gale-Stewart games whose winning sets are infinitary rational relations accepted by 2-tape Büchi automata is equivalent to the determinacy of (effective) analytic Gale-Stewart games which is known to be a large cardinal assumption. Then we prove that winning strategies, when they exist, can be very complex, i.e. highly non-effective, in these games. We prove the same results for Gale-Stewart games with winning sets accepted by real-time 1-counter Büchi automata, then extending previous results obtained about these games. Then we consider the strenghs of determinacy for these games, and we prove that there is a transfinite sequence of 2-tape Büchi automata (respectively, of real-time 1-counter Büchi automata) $A_\alpha$, indexed by recursive ordinals, such that the games $G(L(A_\alpha))$ have strictly increasing strenghs of determinacy. Moreover there is a 2-tape Büchi automaton (respectively, a real-time 1-counter Büchi automaton) B such that the determinacy of G(L(B)) is equivalent to the (effective) analytic determinacy and thus has the maximal strength of determinacy. We also show that the determinacy of Wadge games between two players in charge of infinitary rational relations accepted by 2-tape Büchi automata is equivalent to the (effective) analytic determinacy, and thus not provable in ZFC.","['info', 'math']"

Voice quality transformation using an extended source-filter speech model,"In this paper we present a flexible framework for paramet-ric speech analysis and synthesis with high quality. It constitutes an extended source-filter model. The novelty of the proposed speech processing system lies in its extended means to use a Deterministic plus Stochastic Model (DSM) for the estimation of the unvoiced stochastic component from a speech recording. Further contributions are the efficient and robust means to extract the Vocal Tract Filter (VTF) and the modelling of energy variations. The system is evaluated in the context of two voice quality transformations on natural human speech. The voice quality of a speech phrase is altered by means of re-synthesizing the deterministic component with different pulse shapes of the glottal excitation source. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used in one test to predict energies for the re-synthesis of the deterministic and the stochastic component. The subjective listening tests suggests that the speech processing system is able to successfully synthesize and arise to a listener the perceptual sensation of different voice quality characteristics. Additionally, improvements of the speech synthesis quality compared to a baseline method are demonstrated.",['info']

There are selective tools to obtain structural information, probing short and medium ranges (up to typically 1nm), such as coordination, bond distances but also valence state, even at a dilute concentration. Moreover, spatial or time resolution, specific environments (high pressure/temperature, controlled atmosphere) can be achieved. In this chapter, the theoretical basis of each techniques is given and case studies applied to glasses are used to illustrate the structural information that can be extracted.","['chim', 'phys']"
Successive bifurcations in a fully three-dimensional open cavity flow,"The transition to unsteadiness of a three-dimensional open cavity flow is investigated using the joint application of direct numerical simulations and fully three-dimensional linear stability analyses, providing a clear understanding of the first two bifurcations occurring in the flow. The first bifurcation is characterized by the emergence of Taylor–Görtler-like vortices resulting from a centrifugal instability of the primary vortex core. Further increasing the Reynolds number eventually triggers self-sustained periodic oscillations of the flow in the vicinity of the spanwise end walls of the cavity. This secondary instability causes the emergence of a new set of Taylor–Görtler vortices experiencing a spanwise drift directed toward the spanwise end walls of the cavity. While a two-dimensional stability analysis would fail to capture this secondary instability due to the neglect of the lateral walls, it is the first time to our knowledge that this drifting of the vortices can be entirely characterized by a three-dimensional linear stability analysis of the flow. Good agreements with experimental observations and measurements strongly support our claim that the initial stages of the transition to turbulence of three-dimensional open cavity flows are solely governed by modal instabilities.",['spi']
Predicting Concept Changes Using a Committee of Experts,"In on-line machine learning, predicting changes is not a trivial task. In this paper, a novel prediction approach is presented, that relies on a committee of experts. Each expert is trained on a specific history of changes and tries to predict future changes. The experts are constantly modified based on their performance and the committee as a whole is thus dynamic and can adapt to a large variety of changes. Experimental results based on synthetic data show three advantages: (a) it can adapt to different types of changes, (b) it can use different types of prediction models and (c) the committee outperforms predictors trained on a priori fixed size history of changes.",['sdv']
Probabilistic load flow methods to estimate impacts of distributed generators on a LV unbalanced distribution grid,"—The aim of this paper is to apply probabilistic load flow methods on a three phases, unbalanced low voltage distribution network. We use a point estimate method and a Monte Carlo simulation based method to estimate the electrical characteristics (buses voltage, phases and neutral conductors currents) of a distribution grid in presence of a large number of small size photovoltaic generators. Probabilistic load flow allows us to take into account the uncertainty of photovoltaic production and load consumption in load flow computation. The literature shows that PEM method gives good accuracy results while requiring less time simulation than Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper, we aim to check if this assumption is still right with different kinds of probability density function and for a large size electrical network. Usually, random parameters are modeled as a normal distribution. In this work, a generalized extreme value is used to model load consumption behaviour instead of a normal one. The uncertainty of photovoltaic production is supposed to be directly linked to the sky clear index which is modeled as a beta distribution.","['math', 'spi']"
Laser-delayed double shock-wave generation in water-confinement regime,"This paper investigates the different physical processes involved during laser-delayed double shock-wave generation in water-confined geometry. With this technique, two laser pulses, separated by a Δt duration, irradiate a target immersed in water at an intensity of a few GW/cm2 and form a high pressure plasma which results in a double shock-wave generation. This 2 pulses configuration is currently being investigated as an attractive method for improving the LASer Adhesion Test (LASAT) [L. M. Barker and R. E. Hollenbach, J. Appl. Phys. 43, 4669–4674 (1972)] technique by adapting the time delay Δt to the position of interfaces. The LASAT technique is a noncontact adhesion test allowing to generate a high-level tensile stress near interfaces with the use of laser-driven shock wave. The generation of two delayed high-intensity shock waves by laser plasma in the water-confinement regime has been investigated at 10ns@532 nm with the new Nd:YAG laser GAIA from Thales Laser company in the new facility HEPHAISTOS. For each incident Gaussian laser impulsion, the characterization of the high-amplitude laser-plasma-generated shock wave and its propagation through the target has been performed using a velocity interferometer system for any reflector [L. Berthe et al., “State-of-the-art laser adhesion test (LASAT),” Nondestr. Test. Eval. 26(3–4), 303–317 (2011)]. The new laser facility allows us a nanosecond-control of the time delay between the two laser pulses and a precise control of each laser maximum-intensity. Therefore, the influence of the first laser-induced plasma, on the second shock-wave generation has been studied by modifying different parameters such as the delay Δt and the intensity I1 and 12 of each pulse and different aluminum plate thicknesses from 0.2 to 1.5 mm. Preliminary tests show that the maximum pressure level of the second generated shock wave is sensitive to the time delay between the two impulsions and influenced by the plasma generated by the first laser pulse.",['spi']

Quantification of high frequency stream-aquifer exchanges from the local to the watershed scaleQuantification haute fréquence des échanges nappe- rivière depuis l'échelle locale jusqu'au bassin versant,"It is based on the implementation of a network of LOcal MOnitoring Stations (LOMOSs) within the sampling of the Avenelles experimental site (40 km 2 , GIS ORACLE). The LOMOS network has been developed within the framework of the ONEMA NAPROM project and the PIREN Seine research project. At each LOMOS, water pressure and temperature data have been monitored with a 15 min time step for 3 years. This unique dataset is used to analyze the variability of the interface hydrological functioning, as well as determine coupled hydrological-hydrogeological distributed model's parameters. The net water exchanged flux is lower than the real water flux flowing upwards and downwards of the interface. This illustrates the potential of the model to constrain geochemical processes occurring in the interface.Ces travaux s'attachent à promouvoir une approche intégrée Mesure-Interpolation-Modélisation ayant pour objectif de quantifier les échanges nappe-rivière depuis l'échelle locale de la section de rivière jusqu'à l'échelle du bassin versant (Flipo et al. 2014). Ils s'appuient sur le dispositif de MOnitoring LOcal des échanges NAppe-RIvière (MOLONARI) implanté le long de 6 km de rivières du bassin des Avenelles (40 km 2 , GIS ORACLE), développé dans le cadre des projets ONEMA NAPROM et PIREN Seine. Les chroniques de température et de pression, quart horaires acquises en continu pendant 3 ans, sont analysées et exploitées pour paramétrer une modélisation du bassin versant. Il apparaît alors que le flux d'eau net échangé entre les aquifères et le réseau hydrographique est bien plus faible que le flux d'eau total transitant à travers l'interface nappe-rivière. La spatialisation des échanges nappe-rivière par modélisation d'une part, et la capacité de ces modèles à simuler des inversions de flux à l'interface d'autre part, ouvrent des perspectives de couplage avec des modélisations de leur fonctionnement biogéochimique, et plus largement des bassins versants.",['phys']
Cutting force sensor based on digital image correlation for segmented chip formation analysis,"Conventional piezoelectric sensors cannot record the force fluctuations at high frequencies to monitor serrated chip formation. Recently, force measurements by using digital image correlation (DIC) have been reported thanks to imaging devices that become more and more efficient, thereby opening possibilities of high rate acquisition. This study proposes to apply DIC based on closed-form solutions in order to measure cutting forces at camera acquisition frequency. The considered displacement fields are obtained from the Flamant–Boussinesq solution. This method is first applied to picture pairs shot during the cut and then to a full sequence of pictures recorded upon orthogonal cutting of hardened AISI 52100 steel with a c-BN tool. To validate part of the corresponding mechanism, the change of cutting forces is finally investigated when chip segments are formed.",['spi']

Tuning the structure of in-situ synthesized few layer graphene/carbon composites into nanoporous vertically aligned graphene electrodes with high volumetric capacitance,"Few layer graphene/carbon (FLG/C) composites are prepared directly via the rapid and simple exfoliation of expanded graphite in the presence of carbon based natural precursors (i.e. protein, polysaccharide) in water, followed by carbonization process. Several parameters such as nature of C-precursor, FLG/C ratio and carbonization conditions (gas, temperature) are modified in order to optimize the morphology, composition and porosity of FLG/C and thereby investigate their impact on gravimetric and volumetric capacitance, their stability and contribution of pseudocapacitance (Ps) vs. Double-layer capacitance (DL). Few composites exhibit extremely high capacitance considering their low BET-surface area ranging in 130e260 m 2 /g. The highest gravimetric and volumetric capacitance of 322 F/g and 467 F/cm 3 respectively (0.5 A/g); and energy/power performance is reached for FLG/C:1/2, synthesized from graphite-bovine serum albumin (BSA). Despite relatively high theoretical pseudocapacitance contribution of 69% (1.1 V), this sample shows also high capacity retention at high current density and elevated energy-to-power densities. The overall great capacity performance is attributed to the high electrochemical surface area from combined structural features: ultramicroporosity, FLG alignment with high accessibility of FLG edges and elevated packing density. The transport limitation enhances however at higher scan rate (>100 mV/s).","['phys', 'spi', 'chim']"
Control of robots sharing their workspace with humans: an energetic approach to safety,"In this paper, we propose a physically meaningful energy-related safety indicator for robots sharing their workspace with humans. Based on this indicator, a safety criterion accounting for the breaking capabilities of the robot is included as a quadratic constraint in the control algorithm. This constraint is modulated by the distance between the human operator and the end-effector of the robot. The control algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem and computes the actuation torque of a robotic manipulator given some task to be performed and physical constraints to respect. The overall framework is validated in a physics simulation software on a Kuka LWR4 and different behaviours of the robot towards a considered obstacle in its environment are evaluated and discussed.",['spi']

A novel toolbox to investigate tissue spatial organization applied to the study of the islets of Langerhans,"Thanks to the development of new 3D Imaging techniques, volumetric data of thick samples, especially tissues, are commonly available. Several algorithms were proposed to analyze cells or nuclei in tissues, however these tools are limited to two dimensions. Within any given tissue, cells are not likely to be organized randomly and as such have specific patterns of cell-cell interaction forming complex communication networks. In this paper, we propose a new set of tools as an approach to segment and analyze tissues in 3D with single cell resolution. This new tool box can identify and compute the geographical location of single cells and analyze the potential physical interactions between different cell types and in 3D. As a proof-of-principle, we applied our methodology to investigation of the cyto-architecture of the islets of Langerhans in mice and monkeys. The results obtained here are a significant improvement in current methodologies and provides new insight into the organization of alpha cells and their cellular interactions within the islet's cellular framework.","['sdv', 'info']"
Tree Automata with Constraints: a brief survey,"It is well-known that tree automata define exactly regular languages of trees. However for some problems one sometimes needs to test for equalities and disequalities of subtrees. For instance, ranges of non-linear tree transducers cannot be represented by tree automata. To overcome this problem some extensions of tree automata with tree (dis)equality constraints have been proposed. This talk surveys some of the most important models and their applications. Two families of automata are presented. First, we consider automata with local constraints. They have been used to solve problems related to pattern-matching, tree rewriting and more recently the tree homomorphism problem. Then, motivated by applications to XML processing and security protocols verification, we present a more recent model of tree automata with global constraints.",['info']
Asymptotic analysis of discounted zero-sum games: some recent advances,"The existence of a limit for the values of discounted zero-sum repeated games has been established for finite stochastic games and games with incomplete information on both sides (with state independent or symmetric signals). Recent results show that this property holds for absorbing or recursive games with compact action spaces (Sorin and Vigeral, 2013a) but does not extend to general stochastic games (Vigeral, 2013). Similar striking counter examples have been obtained for finite ""stochastic games with symmetric signals"" (Ziliotto, 2013). We will exhibit a class of models linking these results and explaining the rôle of reversibility and oscillations (Sorin and Vigeral, 2013b).",['math']
On glottal source shape parameter transformation using a novel deterministic and stochastic speech analysis and synthesis system,"In this paper we present a flexible deterministic plus stochastic model (DSM) approach for parametric speech analysis and synthesis with high quality. The novelty of the proposed speech processing system lies in its extended means to estimate the un-voiced stochastic component and to robustly handle the transformation of the glottal excitation source. It is therefore well suited as speech system within the context of Voice Transformation and Voice Conversion. The system is evaluated in the context of a voice quality transformation on natural human speech. The voice quality of a speech phrase is altered by means of re-synthesizing the deterministic component with different pulse shapes of the glottal excitation source. A subjective listening test suggests that the speech processing system is able to successfully synthesize and arise to a listener the perceptual sensation of different voice quality characteristics. Additionally, improvements of the speech synthesis quality compared to a baseline method are demonstrated.",['info']

Blind Calibration for Phase Shifts in Compressive Systems,"We consider a blind calibration problem in a compressed sensing measurement system in which each sensor introduces an unknown phase shift to be determined.

Furthermore, when dealing with measurements generated from multiple unknown (but sparse) signals, we extend the approach for phase retrieval to solve the calibration problem in order to recover the signals jointly along with the phase shift parameters. The proposed methods are shown to have significantly better recovery performance than individual recovery of the input signals when the number of input signals are sufficiently large.","['info', 'spi']"
On the Logical Origin of the Laws Governing the Fundamental Forces of Nature: A New Algebraic-Axiomatic Matrix Approach,"In this article, as a basic mathematical approach to the origin of the laws of nature, using a new algebraic axiomatic (matrix) formalism based on the ring theory and Clifford algebras (presented in Sec.2), “<b><i>it is shown that certain mathematical forms of the fundamental laws of nature, including laws governing the fundamental forces of nature (represented by set of two definite classes of general covariant massive field equations, with new matrix formalisms), are derived uniquely from only a very few axioms</i></b>”; where in agreement with the rational Lorentz group, it is also basically assumed that the components of relativistic energy-momentum can only take rational values. In essence, the main scheme of this new mathematical axiomatic approach to fundamental laws of nature is as follows. First based on the assumption of rationality of D-momentum, by linearization (along with a parameterization procedure) of the Lorentz invariant energy-momentum quadratic relation, a unique set of Lorentz invariant systems of homogeneous linear equations (with matrix formalisms compatible with certain Clifford and symmetric algebras) is derived. By first quantization (followed by a basic procedure of minimal coupling to space-time geometry) of these determined systems of linear equations, a set of two classes of general covariant massive (tensor) field equations (with matrix formalisms compatible with certain Clifford and Weyl algebras) is derived uniquely as well. Moreover, each derived field equation also includes a definite form of torsion field appeared naturally as the generator of the field’s invariant mass. In addition, it is shown that (1+3)-dimensional cases of the derived two classes of field equations represent a new general covariant massive (matrix) formalism of the bispinor fields of spin-2, and spin-1 particles, respectively. These uniquely determined new bispinor fields by this axiomatic approach, in fact, represent a unique set of generalized massive forms of the laws governing the fundamental forces of nature, including the Einstein (gravitational), Maxwell (electromagnetic) and Yang-Mills (nuclear) field equations. Furthermore, it is also shown that the (1+2)-dimensional cases of derived two classes of field equations represent a new general covariant massive (matrix) formalism of the bispinor fields of spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 particles, respectively, corresponding to the Dirac and Rarita-Schwinger equations. &#160&#160&#160As a particular consequence, it is shown that a certain massive formalism of general relativity – with a definite form of torsion field appeared originally as the generator of the gravitational field’s invariant mass – is obtained only by first quantization (followed by a basic procedure of minimal coupling to space-time geometry) of a certain set of special relativistic algebraic matrix equations. It has been also proved that the Lagrangian densities specified for directly derived new massive forms of the Maxwell, Yang-Mills and Dirac field equations, are gauge invariant, where the invariant mass of each field is generated solely by a certain torsion field. In addition, in agreement with recent astronomical data, a new form of massive particle has been also identified (as gauge boson of the U(1) symmetry group) with invariant mass: ""<b><i>m</i><sub>γ</sub> ≈ 4.90571×10<sup>–50</sup>kg</b>"", generated by a definite coupled torsion field of the background space-time geometry. &#160&#160&#160Moreover, based on the definite mathematical formalism of this axiomatic approach, along with the C, P and T symmetries (represented basically by the corresponding quantum operators) of the fundamentally derived field equations, it has been concluded that the universe could be realized solely with the (1+2) and (1+3)-dimensional space-times (where this conclusion, in particular, is based on the T-symmetry). It is proved that CPT is the only (unique) combination of C, P, and T symmetries that could be defined as a symmetry for interacting fields. In addition, on the basis of these discrete symmetries of derived field equations, it has been also shown that only left-handed particle fields (along with their complementary right-handed fields) could be coupled to the corresponding (any) source currents. Furthermore, it has been shown that the metric of background space-time is diagonalized for the uniquely derived fermion field equations (defined and expressed solely in (1+2)-dimensional space-time), where this property generates a certain set of additional symmetries corresponding uniquely to the SU(2)<sub>L</sub>⊗U(2)<sub>R</sub> symmetry group for spin-1/2 fermion fields (representing “1+3” generations of four fermions, including a group of eight leptons and a group of eight quarks), and also the SU(2)<sub>L</sub>⊗U(2)<sub>R</sub> and SU(3) gauge symmetry groups for spin-1 boson fields coupled to the spin-1/2 fermionic source currents. <b>Hence, along with the known elementary particles, eight new elementary particles, including four new charge-less right-handed spin-1/2 fermions (two leptons and two quarks, where the predicted two quarks ""z<sub>u</sub> and z<sub>d</sub>"", specifically emerged in two subgroups with ordinary anti-quarks such that: (s&#772, u&#772, b&#772, z<sub>u</sub>) and (c&#772, d&#772, t&#772, z<sub>d</sub>); there are also a similar group representation for two predicted new leptons: (ν&#772<sub>μ</sub>, e<sup>+</sup>, ν&#772<sub>τ</sub>, z<sub>e</sub>) and (μ<sup>+</sup>, ν&#772<sub>e</sub>, τ<sup>+</sup>, z<sub>n</sub>)), a spin-3/2 fermion, and also three new spin-1 (massive) bosons (represented by W'<sup>+</sup>, W'<sup>–</sup>, Z', with properties similar to ordinary (massive) bosons W<sup>–</sup>, W<sup>+</sup>, Z, where in particular the new boson Z' is the complementary right-handed particle of ordinary Z boson) are predicted uniquely by this new axiomatic mathematical formalism.</b> As a particular result, based on the definite matrix formalism of the derived general covariant Maxwell (and Yang-Mills) field equations, it has been also concluded that magnetic monopoles could not exist in nature.

First steps toward embedding real-time audio computing in Antescofo,"The develop of Antescofo software has allowed contemporary musicians to create interactive music pieces in a more precise way in terms of the synchronization between human and machine. INRIA's MUTANT team has been developing a version of Antescof that changes the DSP computation paradigm and translates the responsibility to the software and no longer to the host environment. Thus, the composer gets more freedom t create his own effects. Plus, it allows the composer to change the sound link network in execution time. Also, the computational power required for the DSP is optimized. Lastly, this new version creates the possibility of generating a self-contained score for UDOO platform, creating this way the first steps toward the preservation of interactive musical pieces through time. In this article the context of the new version of Antescofo is presented, as well as the benefits of it. The methodology of compilation of the Faust DSP tool in Antescofo is described and a comparison of the profiling tests between the old and new versions is detailed. The results shows an improvement of about 46% in terms of the computational power needed to process the signals and they represent clear indicators of optimization that can be extended to the compilation of the Antescofo software for the UDOO platform.",['info']
The impact of incorrect social information on collective wisdom in human groups,"A major problem resulting from the massive use of social media is the potential spread of incorrect information.

We performed experiments in which participants had to estimate a series of quantities, before and after receiving social information. Unbeknownst to them, we controlled the degree of inaccuracy of the social information through ‘virtual influencers’, who provided some incorrect information. We find that a large proportion of individuals only partially follow the social information, thus resisting incorrect information. Moreover, incorrect information can help improve group performance more than correct information, when going against a human underestimation bias. We then design a computational model whose predictions are in good agreement with the empirical data, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying our results. Besides these main findings, we demonstrate that the dispersion of estimates varies a lot between quantities, and must thus be considered when normalizing and aggregating estimates of quantities that are very different in nature. Overall, our results suggest that incorrect information does not necessarily impair the collective wisdom of groups, and can even be used to dampen the negative effects of known cognitive biases.",['shs']
Structural equation modeling with lavaan,"This book presents an introduction to structural equation modeling (SEM) and facilitates the access of students and researchers in various scientific fields to this powerful statistical tool. It offers a didactic initiation to SEM as well as to the open-source software, lavaan, and the rich and comprehensive technical features it offers. Structural Equation Modeling with lavaan thus helps the reader to gain autonomy in the use of SEM to test path models and dyadic models, perform confirmatory factor analyses and estimate more complex models such as general structural models with latent variables and latent growth models. SEM is approached both from the point of view of its process (i.e. the different stages of its use) and from the point of view of its product (i.e. the results it generates and their reading).",['shs']
A new algorithm to automatically detect the pith on rough log-end images,"X-ray computer tomography has proved to be efficient for measuring internal and external characteristics of logs that are relevant for estimating wood quality at the sawmill. However, this technology remains expensive (two sawmills in France are equipped) and there is a need to provide low-cost tools for smaller sawmills. It could help them become more competitive. There is also a need for new tools available everywhere , for example to estimate wood quality on the harvester, at the road side, or on the log yard (e.g. with mobile-phone cameras). Contrary to X-ray scans, low-cost cameras provide very different images. Moreover few works have been done on such cameras so far. The pith in log end images is an important feature. It is usually required to detect other wood characteristics (for example annual rings) and to process further toward wood quality estimation. The pith's location is a real challenging problem for untreated log ends. In this context, we propose a robust and efficient algorithm to address this challenge. It consists of a mixture between Hough Transform and an approach based on state-of-the-art algorithms, known as Hough-based algorithms. We validated the proposed method on RGB images of Douglas fir taken with a digital camera after harvesting wood in the forest. The obtained results show a better detection of the pith on rough log end images than some state-of-the-art algorithms. The algorithm may process images in real-time which is compatible with sawmill requirements.",['scco']
Mode recognition of hybrid dynamical systems with nonlinear modes using Takagi-Sugeno models,"This paper deals with switching detection and recognition of current operating mode in hybrid systems, where the nonlinear modes are represented by a Takagi Sugeno model. A data-based projection method is used to generate a set of signals, named residuals. This method uses only the input/output known signals and the kind of model (linear, bilinear, …); the precise value of the model parameters is not needed. The residuals may be used as an operating mode indicator under discernability conditions. These conditions are tested on-line. An academic example is provided to illustrate the efficiency of this method.",['spi']
Diagnostic des systèmes à commutations : Reconnaissance du mode de fonctionnement d'un système modélisé sous forme Takagi-Sugeno à paramètres locaux incertains,"Cet article concerne la détection de commutation et la reconnaissance du mode de fonctionnement actif des systèmes dynamiques hybrides Multi-entrées/Multi-sorties, où les modes non linéaires sont représentés par un modèle de type Takagi Sugeno (TS). Deux méthodes basées sur des techniques de projection sont proposées et utilisées afin de générer un ensemble de résidus qui sont des indicateurs de mode: la première est la méthode bien connue de l'espace de parité qui nécessite la connaissance exacte des paramètres locaux du modèle TS et des fonctions de pondérations. La seconde est une méthode de projection des données qui utilise uniquement les signaux d'entrées/sorties et la connaissance des fonctions de pondération. La connaissance des paramètres locaux n'est pas nécessaire. Les résidus calculés sur une fenêtre glissante permettent de détecter les commutations de modes et de reconnaître le mode de fonctionnement. La sensibilité des deux méthodes vis à vis des incertitudes paramétriques est discutée. Un exemple illustratif est fourni pour montrer l'efficacité des méthodes proposées",['spi']
Nonlinear phenomena study in serial multicell chopper,"In this paper, chaotic behavior study of a five-cells chopper when it is associated to a nonlinear load is reported.

On the Input-Output Distinguishability of Single Output Continuous Linear Time-Invariant Systems,"This technical note addresses the distinguishability problem for continuous linear time-invariant systems using their input and output data. The proposed approach is based on the characterization of the class of initial state vectors and control input signals that make the outputs of different continuous linear time-invariant systems indistinguishable. This class is defined here as the indistinguishability zone. From this characterization, a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the distinguishability of single-input, single-output systems is established. Furthermore, it is shown that multiple-input, single-output systems are never distinguishable.",['spi']
Active Mode Recognition of Switched Nonlinear Systems: Application to Fault Detection and Isolation,"Robust switching detection and active mode recognition are addressed for switched nonlinear systems that may switch among non linear modes taken from a finite set. The proposed method uses only a partial knowledge of system parameters and is robust toward local model parameters uncertainties. A possible application of our method is fault detection and isolation, where faulty situations are represented as faulty modes. The nonlinear modes are represented by Takagi-Sugeno models. The proposed switching detection technique and the active mode recognition method use indicator signals that are generated using a data-driven projection technique. The main advantage of this method is that it does not need the knowledge of local model parameters values. Only input-output data and the weighting functions of the TS model are used to generate these indicator signals. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed approach.",['spi']
Robust mode recognition in Hybrid Dynamical Systems with nonlinear modes,"Switching detection and active mode recognition in Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS) with nonlinear continuous dynamics are considered in this paper. The nonlinear modes are represented by Takagi-Sugeno models. Two methods based on projection techniques are proposed to generate a bank of residuals which are mode indicators: the first one is the well-known parity space method which uses the TS model parameters, the second one is a data-based projection method that does not need the parameter values of the TS model. Robustness of the two methods against parameter uncertainties is discussed. An illustrative example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",['spi']

Operationalizing and evaluating the FAIRness concept for a good quality of data sharing in Research: the RDA-SHARC-IG (SHAring Rewards and Credit Interest Group),"The RDA-SHARC (SHAring Reward & Credit) interest group is an interdisciplinary volunteer member-based group set up as part of RDA (Research Data Alliance) to unpack and improve crediting and rewarding mechanisms in the sharing process throughout the data life cycle. Background and objectives of this group are reported here. Notably, one of the objectives is to promote the inclusion of data sharing activities in the research (& researchers) assessment scheme at national and European levels. To this aim, the RDA-SHARC-IG is developing two assessment grids using criteria to establish if data are compliant to the F.A.I.R principles (findable /accessible / interoperable / reusable) based on previous works on FAIR data management (Reymonet et al., 2018; Wilkinson et al., 2018; and E.U.Guidelines*): 1/ The self-assessment grid to be used by a scientist as a ‘checklist’ to identify her/his own activities and to pinpoint the hurdles that hinder efficient sharing and reuse of his/her data by all potential users. 2/ The two-level grid (quick/extensive) to be used by the evaluator to assess the quality of the researcher/scientist sharing practice, over a given period, taking into account the means & support available over that period. Assessment criteria are classified according their importance with regards to FAIRness (essential / recommended / desirable) meanwhile good practices are recommended for critical steps. To implement a highly fair assessment of the sharing process, appropriate criteria must be selected in order to design optimal generic assessment grids. This process requires participation, time and input from volunteer scientists data producers/users from various fields.","['sdv', 'sde', 'info']"
Vibration-based fault detection of meshing shafts,"In this article, vibration-based monitoring of cracked shafts is addressed in the context of mechanical transmission of helicopters. The approach developed is based on the detection of cyclostationary components produced by a crack. The cyclostationary theory is first presented on a mechanical point of view. Then a signal processing indicator, the spectral coherence, is introduced in order to quantify the second order cyclostationary content of a signal. The characteristics of the vibration produced in the faulty case are explained from a mechanical model of a cracked shaft. It is then shown that small variations in the structural parameters of the crack creates cyclostationary modulations around the meshing frequencies. This justifies the spectral coherence as a relevant indicator to monitor the crack. The spectal coherence is successful applied on bench data reproducing a crack propagation on an actual helicopter shaft.",['spi']
On mode discernibility and switching detectability for linear switching systems using a data-based projection method,"This paper addresses the problem of Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) of switching systems where faulty behaviours are represented as faulty modes. The objectives of the on-line FDI are to identify accurately the current mode and to estimate precisely the switching time. A data-based method is considered here to generate residuals that will be used for FDI. The discernibility condition between modes is established. It is claimed in the literature that discernibility conditions are necessary for switching detection. However, it is shown in this paper that the switching may be detected with the proposed residuals even if the modes are not discernible. Detectability conditions between modes are established and are shown to be different from discernibility ones. A simulation example is provided to illustrate this important result.",['spi']
Détection de commutations et reconnaissance du mode de fonctionnement sans utilisation explicite des paramètres,"Cet article s'intéresse aux systèmes à commutation qui appartiennent à une classe particulière de systèmes dynamiques hybrides. L'objectif est d'estimer l'instant de commutation et de reconnaître le mode courant. Le principe général de la méthode est d'utiliser des signaux indicateurs, appelés résidus, qui sont générés par la projection des mesures dans un sous-espace engendré par les entrées sur une fenêtre temporelle donnée. L'avantage de cette méthode de génération de résidus est que est que les valeurs des paramètres du modèle ne sont pas utilisées, seule la structure (supposée linéaire dans cet article) des modes est utilisée. Les résidus peuvent être utilisés pour détecter les commutations, si les conditions de discernabilité sont satisfaites. Une extension de la méthode est proposée pour identifier le mode actif en utilisant des données recueillies hors ligne labélisées, conjointement avec les données prélevées en ligne. Un exemple illustratif est traité pour montrer l'efficacité de notre méthode.",['spi']
Model-free residual generation for sensor fault detection and isolation in bilinear systems,"On-line Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) approaches are based on fault indicator signals namely residuals. These residuals allow to verify the consistency of the known signals (control signals and measured outputs) with respect to a reference model. Classical model-based residual generation methods, namely parity space based and observer based methods, need the perfect knowledge of the model equations i.e. the structure SM and the parameters PM. However, in many practical situations, model equations are not exactly known, and very often only the structure SM is available. This paper presents a novel approach that allows to generate residuals for system of bilinear structure SM and under a stability hypothesis, but without an explicit knowledge of the values of parameters PM.",['spi']
A Risk-Based Sensor Management using Random Finite Sets and POMDP,"In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling an agile sensor to perform an optimal control action in the case of the multi-target tracking scenario. Our purpose is to present a random finite set (RFS) approach to the multi- target sensor management problem formulated in the Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. The reward function associated with each sensor control (action) is computed via the Expected Risk Reduction between the multi- target predicted and updated densities. The proposed algorithm is implemented via the Probability Hypothesis Density filter (PHD). Numerical studies demonstrate the performance of this particular approach to a radar beam-pointing problem where targets need to be prioritized.","['math', 'spi']"
A Parameter-free Method for Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation in Bilinear Systems,"This paper is concerned with Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) and more specifically it focuses on a parameter-free residual generation method. The residual signals are obtained by projecting the measured signals onto the kernel of an extended input matrix, which depends on the structure of the system model. The method was not easily applicable in real-world applications due to a high computational complexity. In that paper, fault indicators are constructed differently, using kernels properties, to avoid this complexity problem. A simulated electromechanical actuator example is taken to illustrate the applicability of the method.",['spi']
On efficiency of identification methods for MIMO non linear system using Takagi Sugeno models,This paper deals with the identification of Takagi-Sugeno's (TS) models for non linear MIMO systems. The Takagi-Sugeno's model combines linear models with non linear membership functions. Two-stage approaches were proposed which estimate the parameters of the non linear and linear parts separately and recursively. The contribution of this article is to show the nonoptimality of the scheme when gradient techniques are used in the first stage. A more efficient algorithm using one-stage estimation is proposed.,['spi']

Parameter-free method for switching time estimation and current mode recognition,"This paper is concerned with switching systems which belong to a special class of Hybrid Dynamical Systems. The objective is to estimate switching times and to recognize the current mode. The general principle of the method is to use indicator signals, named residuals, which are generated by projecting the sensor measures into a subspace related to the input signals on a given time window. The advantage of this residual generation method is that the values of the model parameters are not needed, only the kind of model (linear, bilinear, …) is used. The set of residuals may be used, under discernability conditions, to detect mode switching. An extension is proposed to identify the new mode by using a database constituted by sets of collected data that characterize each mode. An illustrative example is taken in order to show the effectiveness of our method",['spi']
Online Classification of Switching Models Based on Subspace Framework,"The paper deals with the modelling of switching systems and focuses on the characterization of the local functioning modes using online clustering approach. The considered system is represented as a weighted sum of local linear models where each model could have its own structure. That implies that the parameters and the order of the switching system could change when the system switches. The presented method consists in two steps. First, an online estimation method of the Markov parameters matrix of the local linear models is established. Secondly, the labelling of theses parameters is done using a dynamical decision space worked out with learning techniques, each local model being represented by a cluster. The paper ends with an example, in view to illustrate the method performances.",['spi']

Non-Asymptotic estimation for on-line systems: Finite-time algorithms and applications,"Finite-time estimation is a way to perform real-time control and achieve specified time performance. The Inria project-team Non-A is focusing on designing such ""non-asymptotic"" algorithms: there, mathematics (algebra, homogeneity) are combined with real-time applications (robotics, energy, environment)… For engineers, a wide variety of information is not directly obtained through measurement. Some parameters (constants of an electrical actuator, time delay in communication, etc.) or internal variables (torques applied to a robot arm, posture and localization of a mobile, detection of impact of angles in biped walk, etc.) are unknown or are not measured. Similarly, more often than not, signals from sensors are distorted and tainted by measurement noises. To control such processes, and to extract information conveyed by the signals, one often has to estimate parameters or variables. Estimation can concern parameters (identification), states (observation), derivatives (differentiation), inputs (left inversion) or noisy data (filtering). It means a nearly infinite number of results have already been produced in this area, concerning either control or signal processing… However, unlike traditional methods, the majority of which pertain to asymptotic statistics, the particularity of Non-A is to develop algorithms which converge after a finite-time. This is summarized in the project's name: ""Non-Asymptotic estimation for online systems"".",['spi']
Localized Haptic Texture: A Rendering Technique Based on Taxels for High Density Tactile Feedback,"We investigate the relevance of surface haptic rendering techniques for tactile devices. We focus on the two major existing techniques and show that they have complementary benefits. The first one, called Surface Haptic Object (SHO), which is based on finger position, is shown to be more suitable to render sparse textures; while the second one, called Surface Haptic Texture (SHT), which is based on finger velocity, is shown to be more suitable for dense textures and fast finger movements. We hence propose a new rendering technique, called Localized Haptic Texture (LHT), which is based on the concept of \textit{taxel} considered as an elementary tactile information that is rendered on the screen. By using a grid of taxels to encode a texture,LHT is shown to provide a consistent tactile rendering across different velocities for high density textures, and is found to reduce user error rate by up to 77.68% compared to SHO.",['info']
Conditions de discernabilité entre les modes de fonctionnement d'un système dynamique linéaire,"Dans cet article, on considère un système dynamique linéaire comportant plusieurs modes de fonctionnement pouvant représenter des comportements normaux ou défaillants. L'objectif est de trouver les conditions nécessaires et suffisantes pour discerner ces modes. Dans le cas où des modes de fonctionnement défaillants sont considérés, la discernabilité correspond a la diagnosticabilité du défaut. Comme dans [1] nous définissons deux notions de discernabilité : la discernabilité à travers les entrées-sorties du système et la discernabilité à travers les résidus de parité pour chaque mode. La condition nécessaire et suffisante (CNS) de discernabilité à travers les résidus de parité de [1] a été obtenue dans le cas où les ordres des espaces de parité des modes sont identiques. Dans cet article, nous levons cette hypothèse. Nous montrons dans ce cadre élargi deux principaux résultats : une CNS de discernabilité à travers les résidus de parité qui géenéeralise celle de [1], puis l'équivalence entre la notion de discernabilité à travers les entrées-sorties et celle de discernabilité à travers les résidus.

"Elastic Shape Analysis of Functions, Curves and Trajectories","We present a Riemannian framework for geometric shape analysis of curves, functions, and trajectories on nonlinear manifolds. Since scalar functions and trajectories can also have important geometric features, we use shape as an all-encompassing term for the descriptors of curves, scalar functions and trajectories. Our framework relies on functional representation and analysis of curves and scalar functions, by square-root velocity fields (SRVF) under the Fisher–Rao metric, and of trajectories by transported square-root vector fields (TSRVF). SRVFs are general functional representations that jointly capture both the shape (geometry) and the reparameterization (sampling speed) of curves, whereas TSRVFs also capture temporal reparameterizations of time-indexed shapes. The space of SRVFs for shapes of curves becomes a subset of a spherical Riemannian manifold under certain special constraints. A fundamental tool in shape analysis is the construction and implementation of geodesic paths between shapes. This is used to accomplish a variety of tasks, including the definition of a metric to compare shapes, the computation of intrinsic statistics for a set of shapes, and the definition of probability models on shape spaces. We demonstrate our approach using several applications from computer vision and medical imaging including the analysis of (1) curves, (2) human growth, (3) bird migration patterns, and (4) human actions from video surveillance images and skeletons from depth images.",['info']
Vector Control of Piezoelectric Transducers and Ultrasonic Actuators,"This paper presents the implementation of a novel vibration amplitude control and resonant frequency tracking for piezoelectric transducers (PTs) and ultrasonic motors (USMs). It is based on a generalization of the vector control method to the PT and the USM, which is explained in the first part. We show that two independent controllers with a similar structure are required: one tracks the resonant frequency and the second controls the amplitude. We then present the implementation into a low-cost digital signal processing controller with a sampling period of 200 µs. Experimental results on a Langevin transducer achieved a time response of 20 ms approximately, and the generality of the method is further demonstrated on a 2-D tactile stimulator at the end of this paper.",['spi']
Sensor Management using Expected Risk Reduction approach,"This paper introduces an Expected Risk Reduction approach to Sensor Management and Multi-Target Tracking in a surveillance context that implements an IR-Radar sensor suite. Due to operational restrictions (for instance, electromagnetic emission constraints), it is assumed that there are more targets than given sensors are capable of tracking simultaneously when a radar emission control is applied. It is also presumed that an incorrect target classification entails a cost that is different for each target class. The Expected Risk Reduction is then applied to a simulated IR-Radar sensor management to preserve an acceptable level of kinematic accuracy on targets of the high cost. Finally, empirical statistical tests show that a track on high priority targets is maintained better when the aforementioned approach is introduced than in the case of other conventional methods, such as the information gain approach or the round robin assignment.","['math', 'spi']"
